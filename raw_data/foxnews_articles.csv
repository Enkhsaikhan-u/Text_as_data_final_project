The economy, the issue that hurt Democrats in the 2024 elections, gave them a major boost in this year'sballot box showdowns.
""Look, we know what’s important right now,"" Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chair Ken Martin said in his speech at the DNC's winter meeting earlier this month. ""S‑‑‑ is too expensive.""
One year after deep concerns over inflation helped PresidentDonald Trumpand Republicans win back the White House and Senate and keep their House majority, Democrats say their decisive victories in last month's 2025 elections, and their overperformances in special elections and other ballot box showdowns this year were fueled by their laser focus on affordability amid persistent inflation.
Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper said Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, who overperformed the public opinion polls as they cruised to double-digit Election Night victories in the blue-leaning states, ""stayed laser focused on the economy,"" and ""talked about it all day, every day.""

The issue also fueled one-time longshot far-left candidateZohran Mamdanito a mayoral victory in New York City as he made cost of living the centerpiece of his campaign.
Democrats say they'll double down on the issue of affordability heading into next year's midterm elections, as they try to win back congressional majorities from the Republicans.
TheDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee(DCCC) chair says Democrats will keep their focus squarely on affordability as they aim to ""take back those gavels"" by capturing the House majority in next year's midterm elections.
ELECTION REFLECTION: DEMOCRATS ‘FLIPPED THE SCRIPT’ ON AFFORDABILITY
House Democrats need to flip just three GOP-held seats in 2026 to win back control of the chamber for the first time in four years.
""We're going to hold Republicans accountable for their policies that are hurting American families,"" Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state, who for a second straight election cycle is chairing the DCCC, told Fox News Digital.
DelBene said she'll keep her focus squarely on affordability as she aims to ""take back those gavels.""
Pointing to last year's elections, she said, ""That was their [Republicans] big message. They were going to lower costs. It has been a big broken promise, and people are feeling that, and that's had a big impact and will continue. People want folks who are going to stand up to them for them, not just be blindly loyal to the president.""
But GOP Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, chair of the rivalNational Republican Congressional Committee, highlighted the Republican narrative, as he took aim at former President Joe Biden, telling Fox News Digital, ""There are challenges out there with the economy, because Biden broke it, and House Republicans, working with President Trump, are going to fix it, and we're working very hard to do that. ""
CHECK OUT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL ON TRUMP AND THE ECONOMY
It's an argument that Trump has repeatedly voiced in recent weeks, as he's pointed fingers at his predecessor for the persistent high costs.
""When I took office last January, I inherited a mess, and very simply, I’m fixing it,"" Trump said this month.
But a recentFox News national pollwas full of apparent warning signs for Trump and the GOP.
Three-quarters of voters questioned in the survey viewedthe economynegatively, and large numbers of respondents, including Republicans, said their costs for groceries, utilities, healthcare and housing have gone up this year.
The poll indicated that voters blame the president, with nearly twice as many pointing fingers at Trump than former PresidentJoe Biden, when asked who is responsible for the current economy.
And Trump's approval rating when it comes to the economy has dropped to record lows in surveys by Fox News and other organizations.
While Trump has repeatedly described the Democrats' focus on affordability as a ""hoax,"" he has also become more engaged in combating high prices in recent weeks, as the president has scaled back some of his tariffs and pledged to lower high food prices. And Trump this month made stops in two key battlegrounds — Pennsylvania and North Carolina — to tout his efforts to combat high prices.

Trump was buoyed this past week by better than expected government reports on inflation and economic growth, and Republicans see better days ahead when it comes to the issue of affordability.
Former Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley, the Trump-backed Republican Senate candidate in next year's race to succeed retiring GOP Sen. Thom Tillis, told Fox News Digital ""we're seeing signs already that the economy is starting to tick up and is starting to take hold as the President's policies are getting in place.""
Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, told Fox News Digital, ""2026 is a year of affordability, and the great news is President Trump has been producing time and time again.""
Pointing to the tax cut provisions in the GOP's sweeping domestic policy measure signed into law this past summer by Trump, Scott said ""2026 is shaping up to be the year where Donald Trump's activities, his actions, the legislation we've passed, shows up for the American voter. And consumers all across the country will see a more affordable economy because of President Trump and the Senate majority and the House majority in the hands of the Republican Party.""

But Martin and the Democrats see it differently.
The DNC chair accuses Republicans of not inheriting a ""mess — they manufactured it. They took the economy and drove it straight into a ditch. They took certainty and swapped it for chaos.""
And Martin predicts Trump and Republicans headed for a ballot box disaster.
""Donald Trump has lost the economy, is losing his mind, and is going to lose the midterms,"" Martin charged.

Economic momentum is building under PresidentDonald Trump, but translating those gains into political advantage will require sharper messaging, economist Stephen Moore said, as voters remain skeptical despite improving indicators.
""There's a perception, and there's reality,"" explained Moore in an interview with Fox News Digital.
""The reality is what the numbers show — that median family income is up by about $1,200 this year, adjusted for inflation. We’re seeing real increases in wealth. Anyone investing in the stock market — not just rich people, but about 160 million Americans — has retirement savings in stocks.""

Still, Moore, a former Trump adviser and co-founder of a free-market advocacy organization, Unleash Prosperity, acknowledged that rising costs in everyday life continue to shape how many Americans view theeconomy.
""People tend to focus on the things that are rising in price, and I understand that,"" Moore said. ""But there are also areas where costs have fallen, including gasoline, airline tickets and some everyday items.""
That disconnect between economic data and how voters feel about the economy poses a political challenge for Trump, who returned to the White House promising affordability but is now confronting doubts over whether that pledge is being met.

A Fox News national survey found that 76% of voters rate the economy negatively, up from 67% in July and 70% at the end of former PresidentJoe Biden’sterm.
The poll showed voters are more likely to blame Trump than Biden for current economic conditions, with three times as many saying Trump’s policies have hurt them personally.
The sentiment has fueled Democratic messaging focused onaffordability, which has resonated in recent state and local elections.

That disconnect, Moore said, isn’t just about prices — it’s also about tone.
""I think people want empathy from the president,"" Moore said. ""People in the middle and working class want to know that this president understands the struggles of working 40 hours a week and still having a hard time meeting their bills.""
To close that gap, Moore compared Trump’s current challenge toRonald Reagan’searly presidency, which followed economic difficulties after Jimmy Carter — a dynamic he said mirrors the aftermath of the Biden administration.

""Trump should use an old line from Ronald Reagan, because Reagan's first 18 months in office were very tough. We had a very bad economy as a residual effect from Jimmy Carter. And Reagan told the American people, stay the course, these policies are going to work and they're going to make America better off.""
Moore said recent data suggest the recovery is accelerating, and that momentum is likely to continue.
""In the last couple of months, the economy has really sped up,"" Moore said. ""At 4.3% growth, that’s a very high rate, and the recovery is well in progress. It’s been a very prosperous first year and I expect 2026 to bring very strong continued economic growth.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-turner-homeownership-making-comeback-thanks-trump-theres-more-come,"SEC TURNER: Homeownership is making a comeback thanks to Trump, but there’s more to come","Citizens Alliance CEO Cliff Maloney joins 'Saturday in America' to react to President Donald Trump weighing a national housing emergency and Charlie Kirk’s call to speed up homebuilding amid the crisis.
In his recent address to the American people, PresidentDonald Trumpsaid: ""Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess. And I’m fixing it.""
When it comes to the border, Trump inherited a catastrophe. Border security became a joke under the Biden administration, which allowed millions of illegal aliens to rush into our country. This travesty did not only make a mockery of our laws, it also increased demand for affordable housing, which in turn increased housing costs for American families.
A recent Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) report revealed that foreign-born migrants accounted for two-thirds of the growth in rental demand across the country. Some places, such as California and New York, saw a 100% growth in migrant-fueled rental demand.
Outrageously, some illegals even receivedHUD’s housing help, siphoning taxpayer dollars away from American citizens. Under Trump’s leadership, HUD is ending this insanity. We cut off illegals from receiving FHA-insured mortgages and announced a hotline to report illegal residents in HUD housing, along with other criminals, because public housing must be safe housing. We are taking decisive action to ensure HUD-funded programs and resources are not benefiting ineligible individuals or illegals.
HOUSING COSTS ARE CRUSHING FAMILIES – HERE’S THE WAY OUT
HUD is moving ahead to help homeowners and get rid of Biden-era regulations.(iStock)
The mess that Trump is fixing goes beyond immigration, and over the past year, HUD has scored win after win to restore sanity and good sense to housing policy. We are putting the American Dream of homeownership back within the grasp of the American people by promoting deregulation, self-sufficiency and common sense.
We started by scrapping the Biden-era Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule. The Biden administration’s negligence in enforcing border security was only matched by its zeal in imposing burdensome regulations on innocent Americans, and the AFFH rule burdened America’s suburbs with red tape. Ending this regulation was a critical step in restoring freedom to local communities.
You cannot regulate your way to prosperity. But you can innovate.
HUD CHIEF BLAMES 'UNCHECKED ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION' PRICING-OUT FAMILIES AMID NEW HOUSING REPORT
That is one of America’s core strengths, along with market-based solutions and private sector ingenuity. At Trump’s direction, we are recalibrating HUD away from overregulation and toward supporting these key tenets of our economy.
That is why I am a longtime champion of Opportunity Zones. This landmark policy has lifted more than 1 million Americans out of poverty. AndTrump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is the largest working family tax cut in modern history, enhances Opportunity Zones permanently. Opportunity Zones are now expected to support over $100 billion of investment, create more than 1 million new jobs and facilitate construction of hundreds of thousands of new homes.
I’ve personally been to 13 Opportunity Zones in Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Georgia and other states, and I’ve witnessed how lives are being transformed.
TRUMP’S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE JUST INTRODUCES A NEW KIND OF DEBT
I visited a vacant factory space in Green Bay,Wisconsin, that was redeveloped into a mixed-use space with affordable homes and thriving businesses; a $5 billion development in Atlanta, Georgia, offering new housing and office spaces; and a factory using cutting-edge methods to build modular homes in Columbus, Ohio. I have spoken to business owners, workers and residents who have seen their downtown areas being rejuvenated, and I have seen the new life animating these places.
Of course, HUD still delivers crucial housing assistance and the numbers prove it.
The mess that Trump is fixing goes beyond immigration, and over the past year, HUD has scored win after win to restore sanity and good sense to housing policy.
This year we helped more than 1 million Americans achieve the American Dream of homeownership by insuring mortgages through HUD’s Federal Housing Administration. This is in addition to the work of HUD’s Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, which provided critical liquidity for more than 430,000 Veterans Affairs loans.
TRUMP ADMIN TARGETS $3.3B HOMELESS HOUSING PROGRAM, 170,000 PEOPLE COULD FACE RETURN TO STREETS: REPORT
And to combat homelessness, we welcomed more than 350,000 faith-based organizationsback to the tableas partners to provide care for the most vulnerable and help them achieve self-sufficiency instead of permanent government dependence.
In addition to supporting homeownership, HUD also assists Americans whose homes were damaged or destroyed in natural disasters. This year, we delivered $12 billion in disaster recovery funds to hurting communities that were affected by floods, storms and other catastrophes.

I personally visited California,North Carolina, and my own beloved state of Texas to meet with survivors of wildfires, storms and floods, hear their needs and see how HUD can help them recover from the wreckage.
But HUD cannot properly focus on such important work when our resources and energy are wasted by promoting radical political ideology.

That’s why our anti-wokeness campaign involved canceling $250 million in wasteful contracts and disbanding the PAVE task force, which disrupted housing markets to supposedly address so-called ""systemic biases."" We also restored safety to HUD shelters for vulnerable women by ending enforcement of a Biden-era rule that allowed men to invade these safe havens. Finally, in cities like Boston, we held local leaders accountable and launched an investigation into illegal, race-based housing policies.
There is more for us to do next year and beyond, but our achievements in 2025 have laid a foundation of success on which we will continue to build. As we approachour great nation’s 250th birthday, HUD will continue protecting and promoting independence and self-sufficiency as the keys to the American Dream of homeownership.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/im-new-virginia-governor-affordability-what-everyone-needs,I’m the new Virginia governor and affordability is what everyone needs,"O'Leary Ventures chairman Kevin O'Leary analyzes the Trump administration's economic boom push and the impact of A.I. on the job market on 'The Story.'
This November, Virginians elected me to be their 75th governor with thelargest margin of victoryfor a Democrat in modern history, in part because I’ve been focused above all on one big issue: affordability.
AcrossVirginia,I heard from families in every community in every part of our commonwealth about the impact of high costs. I met seniors struggling to afford prescription drugs, parents worried about rising energy bills and graduates just breaking into the workforce who couldn't find housing that they could afford.
But I also heard a loud refrain from one other group: business leaders. No matter where I traveled, I met executives and entrepreneurs who were struggling to find the right candidates to fill job openings and increasingly worried that Virginia’s best employees and talent were being priced out of the commonwealth.
The numbers reflect those worries. More than 70% of Virginians believe there isn’t enoughhousingavailable that they can afford to rent or buy, according to recent polling. And nationwide, nearly half of Americans say that everyday costs are difficult to afford.
MIKE JOHNSON SAYS HOUSE GOP WORKING FULL STEAM AHEAD ON TRUMP'S 'AFFORDABILITY AGENDA'

Financial pressures don’t just strain household budgets; they shape where people can build their lives. The U.S. Census Bureau found that almost half of college students in Virginia leave within five years of graduation — a rate that’s above the national average. When people want to work here, they should be able to work, afford a home and ultimately afford to create a life here. They shouldn’t be forced to move across the country or wait on the sidelines because of the cost of their healthcare or housing.
High costs aren’t just a quality-of-life concern, but a matter of economic competitiveness. If we fail to act, we risk slower economic growth, lower tax revenue, and declining productivity — consequences that would disadvantage Virginia for decades to come.
That’s why I’ve said my incoming administration will be relentlessly focused on making Virginia more affordable — so we can attract and retain the best workers, companies and business leaders. As governor, I will make sure that Virginians have every reason to stay here and build their futures. At the same time, I will make it clear to workers and companies across the country why we are the best place to start a career or expand a business.
NEWT GINGRICH: THE SIMPLEST WAY TO MAKE AMERICAN LIFE AFFORDABLE AGAIN
Addressing the affordability crisis starts with ensuring Virginians know they can find a home or apartment that meets their needs and budget. My administration will work to eliminate outdated policies that make it harder to build, follow the success of other states by creating a revolving loan fund to encourage mixed-income development and give localities the power to protect affordable housing in their communities.
A thriving workforce also needs access toaffordable and accessible healthcare. The threats to the Affordable Care Act, massive federal cuts to the healthcare safety net and fewer healthcare providers — particularly in rural Virginia — are putting Virginians’ health and safety at risk.

These are tough challenges, but my administration is ready to find feasible solutions to protect Virginians’ access to affordable coverage — whether that is through the ACA Marketplace or Medicaid. We will also focus on lowering costs for patients at the pharmacy counter, in part bycracking down on predatory practicesby pharmacy benefit managers that drive up the cost of prescription drugs.
Finally, both consumers and businesses deserve the certainty that comes with a predictable energy bill. Here in Virginia, we will prioritize increasing energy generation to meet rising demand, including by supporting our nation-leading offshore wind industry and making it easier to install solar in commonsense locations, such as rooftops and parking lots. We will also build on Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s work to encourage companies to develop the next generation of energy technology, like the world’s first commercial fusion power plant being built right here in Virginia.

High costs aren’t just a quality-of-life concern, but a matter of economic competitiveness.
By lowering the cost of living, we can give Virginians the confidence to bet on themselves and take the kind of risks that power our economy — whether that means developing new skills to match job opportunities in their area, pursuing an advanced degree to increase future earnings, or starting a business to give their families long-term financial freedom. As the next governor of Virginia, I’m ready to work with anyone, including PresidentDonald Trump, to make life less expensive. Because high costs and the inability to retain and attract top talent to Virginia affect everyone — no matter your party affiliation, and no matter if your company has five employees or 5,000.
Virginia is competing against 49 states and the District of Columbia for both the best talent in America and the businesses that inevitably follow that talent. As governor, I intend for Virginia to dominate.

A quiet town in western Denmark is quickly becoming a testing ground for the future of housing.
Skovsporet, described as Europe's largest 3D-printed housing project, is now taking shape in Holstebro. When finished, the development will deliver 36student apartmentsbuilt faster than many single-family homes.
The project sits near VIA University College and serves students in the area. NordVestBo, an affordable housing organization focused on student living, commissioned the development. SAGA Space Architects designed the project in collaboration with 3DCP Group and COBOD. From the beginning, the goal stayed simple and ambitious. Build high-quality homes faster, more efficiently and at a scale traditional construction often struggles to reach. So far, the progress speaks for itself.

AUSTRALIA DEBUTS FIRST MULTI-STORY 3D PRINTED HOME – BUILT IN JUST 5 MONTHS
The six buildings are arranged around shared outdoor areas, creating a village-style layout designed for student life.(SAGA Space Architects)
Skovsporet includes six buildings, and each one holds six ground-level student apartments. Crews printed the structures on site using the COBOD BOD33D construction printer. The machine extrudes a cement-like material layer by layer, following a digital blueprint with millimeter accuracy.
At first, printing a single building took several weeks. However, productivity improved quickly as the team gained experience. By the final building, printing wrapped up in just five days. That pace equals more than one student apartment printed per day.
Even more notable is the small crew required to run the system. Only three people operated the printer on site. As a result, automation handled the heavy work while the team focused on oversight, quality and precision.
Each apartment measures roughly 431 to 538 square feet. Despite their compact footprint, the layouts feel open and intentional. Every unit includes a full kitchen, a study area, a lounge, a bathroom with a shower and a bedroom with a double bed. Large roof windows and slanted ceilings pull daylight deep into the space, helping soften the concrete structure. Inside, coated plywood panels and glass elements add warmth and contrast. The result feels modern and livable rather than industrial. These homes are designed for daily student life, not just architectural headlines.
AFFORDABLE 3D-PRINTED BIONIC ARM USES MUSCLE SIGNALS TO MOVE
The real story at Skovsporet is not just speed. It is repeatability. As the team moved from one building to the next, efficiency improved without sacrificing quality. The BOD3 printer runs on a ground-based track system that allows uninterrupted printing of long wall sections. That consistency makes it easier to scale multi-unit housing projects.
According to COBOD, this kind of automation reduces labor needs, shortens timelines and improves accuracy. For cities facing housing shortages, those benefits matter.
Skovsporet also shows how 3D printing supportsmore sustainable construction. The walls were printed using D.fab concrete with FUTURECEM, a low-carbon cement developed by Aalborg Portland. Because the printer deposits material only where it is structurally needed, waste drops significantly compared to traditional methods. The site layout also preserved 95% of the existing trees by carefully positioning print beds between them. In other words, faster construction did not come at the cost of environmental care.

The 3D printing phase is now complete. Human crews have taken over to install roofs, windows, interiors, furniture and utilities. Landscaped gardens, walking paths and bicycle parking are also underway to create a shared village atmosphere. The project remains on schedule, with residents expected to move in by August 2026.
WORLD’S BIGGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS ARE UNDERWAY IN QATAR
If you care about housing affordability, this project is worth watching. Skovsporet proves that automation can deliver student housing faster while keeping quality high. It also hints at what could come next. Multiunit housing built with fewer workers, less waste and shorter timelines could ease pressure in crowded cities. While 3D-printed homes will not replace traditional construction overnight, they are clearly moving into the mainstream. For students, renters and communities, that shift could open the door to more accessible housing options.

Skovsporet is more than a construction milestone. It is a real-world example of how digital design, automation and sustainability can come together at scale. As Europe, the United States and Australia explore similar projects, this student village in Denmark may become a blueprint for future neighborhoods.

White House economic director Kevin Hassett said Sunday that the Trump administration is taking an all-hands-on-deck approach to tackling the housing affordability crisis.
""Everybody in the whole Cabinet is working on trying to get housing to be more affordable,"" Hassett told ""Fox News Sunday.""
He said the administration is preparing a sweeping proposal aimed at easing the burden on homebuyers, with details expected early in the new year.

He also said that Cabinet officials plan to meet with PresidentDonald Trumpat Mar-a-Lago in the days after Christmas to pitch and review policy proposals.""We have a big list of housing ideas that have been vetted very carefully by the Cabinet secretaries to present to the president in a week or two and we will see which ones he picks,"" he added.
TRUMP'S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE MAY BURDEN AMERICANS WITH MORE DEBT, EXPERTS SAY
The administration’s push comes as housing affordability has become a political liability for Trump and a winning issue for Democrats.
According to aFox News national survey, 76% of voters rate the economy negatively, compared with 67% in July and 70% at the close of former PresidentJoe Biden’stenure. Voters largely blame Trump for the downturn, with about twice as many holding him responsible for the current economy as Biden, and three times as many saying his policies have hurt them personally.

At the same time, approval of Trump’s handling of the economy has dropped to a new low, while disapproval of his overall job performance has climbed to record highs, even among some of his core supporters.
Meanwhile, Democrats leaned heavily on affordability themes in state and local elections this fall and it paid off.
In places like Virginia,New Yorkand New Jersey, where voters have been squeezed by highhousing costsand utility bills, Democratic candidates seized on Trump’s early economic moves, including his trade policy, to argue that his policies were worsening the affordability crisis rather than easing it.

While Hassett declined to detail the proposals, the administration has previously discussed easing zoning restrictions and expanding longer-term mortgage products.
The challenge for Trump will be translating those ideas into relief for voters who increasingly question whether his affordability promises are being fulfilled.

But with inflation remaining persistent, Democrats have been laser focused this year on the issue of affordability, which fueled their decisive victories in last month's2025 electionsand their overperformances this year in a slew of special elections.
But Scott predicts the tide will turn.
""I've said 2026 is a year of affordability, and the great news is President Trump has been producing time and time again,"" he touted.
Pointing to the tax cut provisions in the GOP's sweeping domestic policy measure signed into law this past summer by Trump, Scott said ""2026 is shaping up to be the year where Donald Trump's activities, his actions, the legislation we've passed, shows up for the American voter. And consumers all across the country will see a more affordable economy because of President Trump and the Senate majority and the House majority in the hands of the Republican Party.""
GOP SENATE CAMPAIGN CHIEF AIMS TO EXPAND 2026 MAP IN THIS BLUE-LEANING STATE
Lauren French, communications director at Senate Majority PAC, the top Senate Democrat-aligned outside group, told Fox News Digital that ""even Tim Scott is occasionally right — 2026 will be the year of affordability.""
But taking aim at the GOP narrative, French argued that affordability will continue to grab top billing with voters ""because Americans can't afford Donald Trump and Republican policies that continue to drive up the cost of groceries, basic goods, and, right now, Christmas presents.""
""The out-of-touch insistence from the GOP that the economy is thriving proves they don't understand what working families are facing, which is probably why Democrats won or dramatically overperformed in every contested election this year,"" she emphasized. ""2026 will be no different as Democrats continue to put forward real plans to address the cost-of-living crisis.""
There are 35Senate seatsup for grabs next year, including special elections for GOP-held seats in Florida and Ohio. Overall, Republicans are defending 22 of the seats.
But the map of competitive races is much smaller.
Scott reiterated that open Democrat-held seats in battleground Michigan and swing state New Hampshire are two of the NRSC's top targets, along with Sen. Jon Ossoff in battleground Georgia, whom Republicans consider the most vulnerable Democrat seeking re-election next year.
4 KEY SENATE SEATS REPUBLICANS AIM TO FLIP IN 2026 MIDTERMS TO EXPAND THEIR MAJORITY
The NRSC chair is also eyeingblue-leaning Minnesota, where the Senate GOP campaign arm is working to recruit former professional football sideline reporter turned political activist and commentator Michele Tafoya, who is inching closer to jumping into the race.
""We're excited about expanding our map, and Minnesota is one of the target states that we're looking at,"" Scott said. ""We see real reasons to be optimistic. President Trump was very close in Minnesota. It's a four-point race. We know with the right candidate, we will be successful.""
Apparently pointing to Tafoya, Scott suggested Republicans are likely to land ""a strong candidate in the race,"" and teased ""wait and see"" for ""better news.""
Scott will likely be playing defense in Texas, where there's currently a nasty three-way GOP Senate primary, as well as in North Carolina, Maine and Ohio.
Asked his prediction for next year, Scott said ""54 is clearly within our grasp right now, but with a little bit of luck, 55 is on our side.""

But the rival Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) sees it differently.
""While Democrats have expanded the map and created a path to flip the majority in 2026, Senate Republicans are facing a string of embarrassing recruitment failures and messy primaries — and their toxic agenda of health care cuts and price spikes for hardworking Americans will cost them at the ballot box,"" DSCC spokesperson Joe Bush told Fox News Digital.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-views-year-ending-merriest-since-2020,Fox News Poll: Views on the year ending are merriest since 2020,"The Marks Group CEO Gene Marks joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss John Deere's outlook for the upcoming year, holiday spending trends and consumer budgets.
As 2025 winds down, voters’ outlook on the year ending hasimproved, not only compared to 2024, but also year-over-year since 2020. Almost half say this was a good year for them personally, even as fewer, around one-third, say it was good for the country, according to the latest Fox News survey released Friday. Though concerns persist, such as the future of the country and affording holiday gifts, the upward shift reflects a gradual rebound in optimism since the pandemic-era lows.
Nearly half of voters, 45%, say 2025 was a good year for them. That’s up from 40% last year, and the highest since 2019 when it was 47%. At the same time, 54% say this was a bad year for their family, up from 50% last year.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SOUND ALARM ON HEALTHCARE COSTS
A record-low – 23% said 2020 was a good year for their family. In fact, the 2020 pandemic was the first time in almost a decade that the question veered to the negative: from 2012 to 2019, voters felt more positive than negative.
While still largely net negative, views on how the country fared in 2025 are also rosier than in recent years. Thirty-five percent say it was a good year for the U.S., up from 28% last year. Two-thirds think it was a bad year for the country — a number that has held steady since 2022 and went as high as 78% in 2020.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SAY GO SLOW ON AI DEVELOPMENT — BUT DON’T KNOW WHO SHOULD STEER
Republicans (65% their family, 63%of the country) are more likely thanDemocrats(28%, 9%) and independents (39%, 28%) to be upbeat about 2025 and say it was a good year personally and nationally.
Positivity among Republicans (+31 points for their family, +44 points for the country) and independents (+6, +7) is up since 2024, while ratings have fallen for Democrats (-22, -33).
""Obviously, most of the shifts from 2024 to 2025 are due to how partisans have reacted to the change from a Democratic to a Republican administration,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps conduct Fox News surveys with Democratic partner Chris Anderson. ""It’s not so much that prices have changed or wages have moved, it’s thatRepublicansfeel better with their guy in the White House and Democrats feel worse.""
Evaluations of 2025 are more favorable among men than women, college-educated voters than those without a degree, and households earning $50,000 or more than those with lower incomes.
Voters are divided, however, on the U.S.’s future: 48% are hopeful while 52% are not, yielding a net negative 4 points — a reversal from a +10 positive rating last year (55% hopeful, 45% not hopeful).
Still, these numbers are better than in 2021 (when the question was first asked), when 43% felt hopeful about what was next and 54% did not (-11 net negative rating).
Just as views of the past differ by political party, expectations about the future do, too. Three-quarters of Republicans feel hopeful about what’s ahead, while three-quarters of Democrats say they’re not. Independents are also negative, with about 6 in 10 lacking hopefulness.
And although Republicans felt good about 2025, optimism for the future is down 11 points compared to 86% last year, while Democratic and independent pessimism remains as high — or higher — than it was in 2024.
This is the reverse of four years ago, when about 6 in 10 Democrats were hopeful, while roughly 7 in 10 Republicans and 6 in 10 independents were not.
With theholiday seasonin full swing, so is shoppers’ anxiety as more than half are worried about how they will pay for gifts this year (52%) while slightly less than half are not (48%).
Concern is highest among moms (68%), voters under 30 (68%), Hispanic voters (66%), women without a college degree (64%), and households earning under $50,000 (62%).
Those financial pressures may help explain why most voters (81%) say it’s at least sometimes okay to re-gift something they were given: 62% feel it is sometimes okay, while 19% say it’s always acceptable. Some 19% think it’s never okay.
Acceptance of re-gifting has grown since 2013, when 73% said it was at least sometimes okay and one-quarter said it was never acceptable.
White women, voters under age 45, those with a graduate degree, parents, and Republicans are among those most likely to say re-gifting is acceptable today.

PresidentDonald Trumpheads to battleground North Carolina on Friday as he aims to keep an open Republican-held Senate seat in GOP hands in next year's midterm elections.
Trump will hold an evening event on affordability as he teams up in the crucial southeastern state with Michael Whatley, a formerRepublican National Committee(RNC) chair and clear frontrunner for the GOP Senate nomination in the 2026 race to succeed retiring Republican Sen. Thom Tillis.
Whatley is likely to face off next year against former two-term Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in what's expected to be one of the most expensive and crucial Senate battles in the country, as the GOP works to hold its 53-47 majority in the chamber. And rising prices will be a top issue on the campaign trail.
""President Trump won North Carolina all three times. 2016, 2020, and 2024... because he connects directly with the people of North Carolina, talking about the issues that they care about. So it is very important to have him on the ground,"" Whatley emphasized this week in a Fox News Digital interview.

Low propensity MAGA voters and other Trump supporters don't always head to the polls in elections when the president's not on the ballot, which is a major concern for Republicans heading into next year's midterms.
That's why Whatley, a former state GOP chair whom Trump handpicked in 2024 to run the RNC and urged this summer to run for the Senate, would love to see the president return toNorth Carolinanumerous times next year.

""He is fantastically popular in North Carolina,"" Whatley said of Trump. ""He has a real affinity for the state. The voters...love him, and it'll be very, very good to get him back in North Carolina.""
But more importantly, Whatley and other Republicans are aiming to frame the2026 electionsas a referendum on Trump and his agenda.

""We're certainly going to need him to be on the ballot,"" Whatley emphasized. ""When you think about what happens if we lose the House, if we lose the Senate, if the Democrats take over, and they go right back to investigations and hoaxes and impeachments, that is really, truly the president and his legacy are going to be on the ballot.""
With inflation remaining persistent this year, Democrats have stayed laser focused on the issue of affordability, which fueled them to decisive victories in last month's 2025 elections and over performances in a slew of special elections this year.

And the same issue that boosted Trump and Republicans to sweeping ballot box victories in 2024 is now dragging the president's approval ratings on the economy to record lows.
Whatley argued that the president ""is fighting right now to bring down gasoline prices... We're fighting, you know, every day against the Fed, trying to get them to lower interest rates and make housing more affordable. And you know, there's, there's a fight every day with this administration to try and bring down the prices for everybody.""

And looking ahead to next year, Whatley said, ""We're seeing signs already that the economy is starting to tick up and is starting to take hold as the President's policies are getting in place. We need to make sure that we have the trade policies, the tax policies, the regulatory policies from this administration that are going to help our small businesses, our manufacturers and our farmers across North Carolina.""
ButDemocratic National CommitteeChair Ken Martin sees Trump and Republicans headed for a ballot box disaster.
""Donald Trump has lost the economy, is losing his mind, and is going to lose the midterms,"" Martin said in a statement ahead of Trump's stop in North Carolina.
Whatley has been busy crisscrossing North Carolina and highlighted that ""we're talking to every single community. We will be in all 100 counties across North Carolina, and we're fighting for every single family.""
And he plans to hold tight to Trump.
""Our voters know Donald Trump, and they know me. I've worked on his campaigns since 2016. President Trump won North Carolina in all three election cycles. So we know how to win, and we have the policies that are going to win,"" Whatley emphasized.

And pointing to Cooper, who won election and re-election four times as attorney general before becoming governor, Whatley charged that ""Roy Cooper is on the wrong side of every 80-20 issue. He has fought harder for criminals, for illegal aliens, men who want to, you know, play in women's sports and be in women's locker rooms. Those are issue sets that he's going to have to defend.""

But Cooper's campaign countered, saying in a statement to Fox News Digital that the former governor ""has spent his career fighting for North Carolina families by lowering health care costs and keeping their communities safe while Michael Whatley spent decades at the beck and call of DC politicians delivering for billionaires and special interests at the expense of the middle class.""

PresidentDonald Trumptold Americans this week that 1.45 million U.S. service members would receive a one-time $1,776 ""warrior dividend,"" a $2.6 billion initiative he said would hit service members’ bank accounts before Christmas.
The president credited tariffs for bringing in money.
""We made a lot more money than anybody thought because of tariffs, and the bill helped us along. Nobody deserves it more thanour military, and I say congratulations to everybody,"" Trump said Wednesday.

Reservists ranked O-6 and below are eligible for the checks if they have been on active-duty orders for 31 days or more as of Nov. 30.
Approximately 1.28 million active component military members and 174,000 reserve component military members will receive this supplement.

The money comes not from tariffs but from $2.9 billion that Congress appropriated in the ""big, beautiful bill"" to the Department of War to supplement theBasic Allowance for Housingentitlement.
After taking office, Trump announced an aggressive tariff plan that paired targeted tariff increases with a broader proposal for a 10% across-the-board tariff on nearly all imported goods, a policy he argues would protect U.S. industry and raise substantial federal revenue. Countries he accused of engaging in unfair trade practices or ""ripping off"" the U.S. were hit with tariffs far above the 10% baseline. Brazil and India face 50% levies, and the average rate on Chinese goods is now close to 50% after Trump threatened triple-digit tariffs earlier this year.
The warrior dividend, according to the official, ""exemplifies the department’s ongoing commitment to improving the housing and quality of life for our military members and their families.""
Additionally, the2026 National Defense Authorization Act(NDAA) authorized a 3.8% raise for basic military pay for all service members in 2026.

The president announced his primetime address Tuesday as his administration zeroes in on its economic messaging following Democrats latching onto a winning campaign strategy of ""affordability"" while slamming Trump and Republicans for allegedly rolling out policies that have caused thehousingcrisis to worsen and costs at the checkout lines to rise.
Following a handful of high-profile elections in November handing wins to Democrats who campaigned on the platform, Trump has turned up the heat that Biden administration policies continue to haunt the currenteconomy.
""Eleven months ago, I inherited a mess. And I'm fixing it. When I took office, inflation was the worst in 48 years. And some would say in the history of our country, which caused prices to be higher than ever before, making life unaffordable for millions and millions of Americans. This happened during a Democrat administration, and it's when we first began hearing the word affordability,"" Trump said at the start of his speech.

While costs rose under Biden, Trump touted the savings Americans are seeing under his leadership.
""The price of a Thanksgiving turkey was down 33% compared to the Biden last year,"" Trump said. ""The price of eggs is down 82% since March, and everything else is falling rapidly. And it's not done yet. But boy, are we making progress. Nobody can believe what's going on.""
""UnderBiden,real wages plummeted by $3,000. Under Trump, the typical factory worker, we're seeing a wage increase of $1,300. For construction workers, it's $1,800. For miners – we're bringing back clean, beautiful coal – it's $3,300. And for the first time in years, wages are rising much faster than inflation,"" he continued.

TRUMP SET TO ADDRESS THE NATION IN PRIMETIME WHITE HOUSE SPEECH AS AMERICANS REPORT ECONOMIC SQUEEZE
Trump signed off his addressclaiming that the U.S. is respected once again, and is the ""envy of the entire globe"" as he wished Americans a ""Merry Christmas.""
""Our nation is strong. America is respected and our country is back stronger than ever before,"" Trump said. ""We're poised for an economic boom, the likes of which the world has never seen. Soon we will host the World Cup and the Olympics, both of which I got. But most importantly, we will celebrate the250th anniversary of the Declarationof Independence.""
The speech comes as Trump has launched a new effort focusing on his economic policies, amid criticism surrounding how his administration has handled messaging on economic issues. Scrutiny intensified following theNovember electionsthat delivered Democrats wins in several key elections – including the New York mayoral race, and the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races – where Democrats focused on ""affordability.""

While Trump told Politico in December that he would grade his economy an ""A+++++,"" voters don’t share the same optimism. For example, 76% of voters reported that they view the economy negatively, an increase from 67% who reported the same in July and the 70% who said so following Biden’s term, a November Fox News national survey found.

PresidentDonald Trumpis set to deliver a primetime speech from the White House Wednesday that's expected to reflect on his administration's accomplishments in the past year, while simultaneously looking toward the next three years.
""My Fellow Americans: I will be giving an ADDRESS TO THE NATION tomorrow night, LIVE FROM THE WHITE HOUSE, at 9 P.M. EST. I look forward to 'seeing' you then. It has been a great year for our Country, and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!"" Trump wrote.
Trump did not specify exactly what he will discuss during the address. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, however, said on Fox News' ""American Reports"" Tuesday that he will address his accomplishments since reclaiming the Oval Office in January, adding that he might ""tease some policy that will be coming in the new year, as well.""
""I was just in the Oval Office with the president discussing it,"" she said. ""He's going to talk a lot about the accomplishments over the past 11 months, all that he's done to bring our country back to greatness and all he continues to plan to do, to continue delivering for the American people over the next three years.""

Trump previously held a White House address in November, when two members of the National Guard were shot, killing one and seriously injuring the other in the attack. He also held another White House address in June, flanked by Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, when the U.S. military carried out strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The speech comes after Trump traveled to Pennsylvania earlier in December as part of an anticipated tour promoting his economic policies. The administration has come under scrutiny for its messaging on theeconomy, most notably since the November off-year elections that handed left-wing Democrats ballot box wins after they ran on platforms of ""affordability.""
TRUMP ASKS WHEN HE'LL BE CREDITED WITH CREATING 'PERHAPS THE GREATEST ECONOMY' EVER IN US HISTORY
""They caused the high prices, and we're bringing them down,"" Trump told the crowd in attendance at a casino resort in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania, in December. ""Lower prices, bigger paychecks — you're getting lower prices, bigger paychecks, we're getting inflation — we're crushing it — and you're getting much higher wages. The only thing that is really going up big – it's called the stock market and your 401(k)s.""

The president has celebrated that tariffs leveled on foreign nations, massive deals attracting businesses to open shop in the U.S., unleashing American energy by cutting red tape surrounding oil and other resources, tax cuts under the ""big, beautiful bill,"" among other initiatives are already lowering prices or will in the coming weeks.
Voters, however, have reported that they are feeling an economic squeeze.
Some 76% of voters reported that they view the economy negatively, up from the 67% who reported the same in July and the 70% who said the same at the end of former PresidentJoe Biden’s term, a November Fox News national survey found.
The survey found that voters overwhelmingly blamed Trump over Biden for the economic anxiety. About twice as many voters polled reported that Trump, rather than Biden, is responsible for the current economy, with three times as many voters reporting that Trump’s economic policies have hurt them, on par with their feelings during Biden's final year in office.
In the fall, a handful of elections — most notably the Virginia gubernatorial, New Jersey gubernatorial and New York City mayoral races — handed Democrats sweeping wins. Each Democrat campaigned on the platform of affordability, vowing to address the housing crisis woes and prices at checkout lines while slamming Trump and other Republicans as promoting policies that hurt the average family's pocketbook.

Following the Democrat wins, the president and his administration increasingly have leaned into pinning blame for economic concerns on policies from the Biden administration that have affected theeconomyin the long run.
WHITE HOUSE TURNS UP HEAT ON BIDEN’S ECONOMIC RECORD AS VOTERS SOUR ON ‘AFFORDABILITY’
""The word affordability ... I inherited a mess,"" Trumptold Politicoin December. ""I inherited a total mess. Prices were at an all-time high when I came in. Prices are coming down substantially. Look at energy. You and I discussed before the interview, energy ... energy has come down incredibly. When energy comes down, everything... ’cause it’s so much bigger than any other subject. But energy has come down incredibly. Prices are all coming down. It’s been 10 months. It’s amazing what we’ve done.""
Trump has floated sending payments of $2,000 from tariff revenues to Americans as he touts the nation's economic outlook, while administration officials have said that households will feel tax breaks from the ""big, beautiful bill"" in 2026.
""The bill was passed in July,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent saidearlier in December. ""Working Americans didn't change their withholding, so they're going to be getting very large refunds in the first quarter,"" Bessent told NBC10. ""I think we're going to see $100 (billion)-$150 billion of refunds, which could be between $1,000 and $2,000 per household.

Even as more voters are happy with how things are going in the country, they’re worried.
An overwhelming majority expresses concern about high prices. Four times as many say they’re losing financial ground as feel they’re getting ahead, and most think theeconomyis in bad shape. That’s according to the latest Fox News national survey released Wednesday.
Seventy-two percent rate economic conditions negatively (only fair or poor). That’s an improvement from 76% who said the same last month and the 77% who held that view a year ago, but it’s worse than the 67% who rated it negatively this summer (July 2025).
FOX NEWS POLL: HOW DO VOTERS FEEL ABOUT AI? IT’S COMPLICATED
Meanwhile, 44% say they are falling behind financially, up from 36% in June and about where things stood in October 2024. In polling going back to 2018, that number has only been worse twice: 45% said they were falling behind in June 2023 and 47% in June 2022.
FOX NEWS POLL: HOLIDAY TOGETHERNESS TOPS POLITICAL DIFFERENCES
A lot of the negative sentiment is driven by 9 in 10 Democrats and independents giving the economy bad marks and more than half of each saying they are falling behind. At the same time, nearly half of Republicans give the economy negative marks and about 3 in 10 say they’re slipping financially. Those most likely to say they’re losing ground include women under age 45 (57%), households with income below $50,000 (56%), independents (53%), urban voters (49%), and those without a college degree (49%). Women are 12 percentage points more likely than men to say they are falling behind (50% vs. 38%).
All this might shed light on why only 39% of voters approve of how President Donald Trump is handling the economy — one point above last month’s low of 38% — and why 58% think he is focused on the wrong things. That’s about the same response voters gave former President Joe Biden four years ago, when 54% said he was prioritizing the wrong issues.
Approval of Trump’s performance is also below 40% on healthcare (37%), government spending (37%) and tariffs (36%). He received better marks on foreign policy (42%), immigration (45%) and crime (47%). His best job numbers are on border security, where a slim 51% majority approves.
Trump’s overall job rating is upside-down by 12 points — 44% approve and 56% disapprove. That’s a bit of an improvement since a dip last month when it was 41–58% (his second-term low). His highest this term, 49–51%, came in March, while his best over both terms was 49-49% in April 2020.
Views on the direction of the country are on a similar track, with 59% saying they are dissatisfied. That’s a 9-point improvement from a year ago, when 68% were unhappy at the end of Biden’s term. Meanwhile, 41% say they’re satisfied, up from 31% in December 2024. The improvement is driven more by Republicans, whose satisfaction jumped 53 points, than by Democrats, whose satisfaction fell 32 points. Among independents, there is also an uptick (+8).
Despite the current inflation rate being lower than the long-term average, fully 90% of voters are extremely or very concerned aboutinflation and high prices. That’s the most in more than two years, and 61% are extremely concerned, up from 48% in June and the largest number in more than two years. About the same share is worried about healthcare prices (86% concerned, including 55% extremely concerned).
That explains why the top three issues voters say the president should be paying more attention to right now are high prices (42%), healthcare (19%) and jobs (12%).
And they think he should be paying less attention to immigration (30%), tariffs (28%) and foreign policy (17%).
NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF AMERICAN VOTERS BACK SOCIAL MEDIA BAN FOR KIDS UNDER 16, FOX NEWS POLL SHOWS
The issue both Democrats and Republicans say should be Trump’s priority is high prices, and they also agree the next two issues should be healthcare (to varying degrees) and jobs.
""Trump’s position is better than Biden’s a year ago, but worse than his own in late 2017,"" said Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who conducts the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""The problem is voters haven’t gotten used to a six-dollar box of cereal, and they don’t think the president’s policy initiatives — the One Big Beautiful Bill, and on tariffs and immigration — are addressing prices.""
Majorities are concerned about the country’s political divisions (82%), the decline of moral values (75%), crime (74%), the federal deficit (71%), AI technology (63%) and climate change (58%). Concern about illegal immigration decreased from 67% in June to 57% in the new survey, while 66% say they are worried about ICE detentions and deportations.
Democratsare nearly five times as likely as Republicans to say Trump should pay less attention to immigration, while three times as many Republicans as Democrats say foreign policy should be a lower priority. Roughly equal numbers in both parties think he should turn his attention away from tariffs. Tariffs are the issue on which Trump receives his lowest approval among all voters (36%) and among Republicans (72%).
– In 2017, during Trump’s first term, 62% of voters felt he was keeping his ""America First"" promise. Today, that’s down to 49% who feel that way (51% say ""he abandoned that pledge""). Most of the decline comes from a 20-point drop among Democrats and a 26-point drop among independents. Among Republicans, 91% said Trump was keeping his ""America First"" pledge in 2017 and 87% feel he is today.
– While all administration members included in the survey have a net negative job rating, some fared better than others. Secretary of StateMarco Rubioreceived the best marks, with a net negative score of -5 points. Next, it’s Vice President JD Vance, at -8, Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. at -12 each, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at -13, and Secretary of DefensePete Hegsethat -19. Among Republicans, approval hits 87% for Trump and 86% for Vance and Rubio, 80% for Noem, 78% for Hegseth and 77% for Kennedy. Approval among MAGA supporters is even higher: Trump 97%, Vance 94%, Rubio 92%, Noem 90%, Hegseth 88% and Kennedy 87%.
– More than 6 in 10 voters disapprove of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. Some 22% of Republicans disapprove of their party’s lawmakers, while 34% of Democrats disapprove of theirs. Three quarters of independents disapprove of congressional Democrats and Republicans.
– Around two-thirds of both parents and voters generally favor banning children under age 16 from using social media platforms as well as banning cellphones in K-12 classrooms. More Republicans favor the social media ban (73%) and cellphone ban (81%) than Democrats (56% and 59% respectively). Non-parents (71%) are more likely than parents (63%) to want cellphones out of school.
– A 53% majority opposes theU.S. militaryusing deadly force against presumed Venezuelan drug-trafficking boats, up from 47% last month. That 6-point increase in opposition comes from Democrats (+8 points), Republicans (+6), and independents (+4).
– Most Republicans (84%) favor using the National Guard and U.S. military to assist local law enforcement in fighting crime in big cities, while most Democrats (87%) and more than half of independents (57%) oppose doing so. Overall, 47% of voters favor the action and 53% oppose it.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-blast-rent-controls-failed-policy-leaves-renters-worse-off-than-before,Washington Post blasts rent control as 'failed policy' that leaves renters 'worse off' than before,"Cheryl Casone reports on NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani's controversial rent freeze plan. Current Mayor Eric Adams may block the plan by packing the Rent Guidelines Board.
The Washington Post editorial board took a hard-line stance againstrent control policies, arguing that ""capping prices is a textbook policy failure"" that ultimately leaves renters ""worse off"" than they would have been otherwise.
Inan editorial Tuesday, the Post cited failures of rent control in cities such as St. Paul and New York City as evidence that the Los Angeles City Council's 12-2 vote to lower its existing cap on annual rent increases will do more harm than good.
""Whenever people get anxious about affordability, populists offer up a deceptively simple solution: rent control. Yet capping prices is a textbook policy failure that leaves renters in every community which tries it worse off than they would have been otherwise: less housing supply, more deferred maintenance and reduced mobility. Fresh examples aren’t needed, yet cities and states keep repeating the experiment,"" the editorial board wrote.

Contrasting the differences in outcomes between rent-controlled and cities without rent control, the Post highlighted ""the tale of theTwin Citiesin Minnesota,"" comparing St. Paul to neighboring Minneapolis to show how their sharply different housing policies tell a compelling story.
""In 2022, St. Paul ushered in one of the strictest controls in the country, capping rent increases at 3 percent for most apartments. Its neighbor Minneapolis, just across the Mississippi River, rejected price controls and concentrated instead on creating housing supply to meet demand,"" the paper detailed.
""In St. Paul, housebuilding permits plummeted by 79 percent in the first year. In Minneapolis, they increased nearly four times. Rents went up in St. Paul more than twice as much as Minneapolis, in part because some landlords maxed out the cap to make up for future losses, according to a story this week in theWall Street Journal,"" the Post editorial read.
According to the Post, while St. Paul is ""trying to clean up the mess it made"" through its housing policies, critics of rent control won the mayoral races in both cities last month.

The editorial cited Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck, who once quipped that rent control is ""the most efficient technique presently known to destroy a city — except for bombing.""
""It becomes irrational for landlords to invest in upkeep. Others pull properties off the market to sell. Landlords who keep renting will be more likely to hike rents when the lease is first signed to account for their limited ability to raise prices in the future. This will make initial rent costs higher than necessary. Meanwhile, renters will be less likely to upsize or downsize as needed, not wanting to sign onto a higher-cost lease upfront,"" the Post explained.

The Post concluded there is no ""feigning ignorance"" about the ""consequences that inevitably follow these caps,"" pointing to New York City's estimated 50,000 vacant apartments — ""thanks to rent control policies"" — as evidence.
""In Scotland, the Scottish National Party capped rent hikes at 3 percent in 2022 — only to report the highest rent increases on record this fall. Meanwhile, in Argentina, President Javier Milei abolished rent controls in December 2023. Properties flooded the market, and rents have fallen by 40 percent on average. That’s something American cities would be wise to replicate,"" the editorial board wrote.

A pair of prominent Senate Republicans has joined Senate Democrats in support of legislation that would roll back PresidentDonald Trump’sexecutive order on federal unions, but whether the bill gets a vote remains in the air.
The House last week passed its version of the bill from Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, dubbed the American Workers Protection Act, that would reverse a March executive order barring collective bargaining for most federal unions across a variety of agencies, like the Departments of War, Justice, State, Energy and Veterans Affairs.
That bill succeeded in the lower chamber with the aid of nearly two dozen House Republicans, but the same level of support among Senate Republicans is unlikely.

So far, only Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine, have signed on as co-sponsors to the Senate’s version of the bill, first introduced by Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., in September.
Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement to Fox News Digital that she agreed with Golden that ""collective bargaining, which is afforded tofederal employeesunder the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, should be restored.""
And Murkowski argued that the country’s federal employees ""deserved these protections.""

""Collective bargaining rights and workplace protections have lifted up federal employees across the United States for decades, protecting them from unsafe working conditions and political retribution,"" she said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
The push to nix Trump’s order likely won’t see the same level of bipartisan support in the upper chamber, given that the bill is currently sitting in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen.Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has introduced several right-to-work bills, and because one of the more pro-union Republicans, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is skeptical of the bill.
""I don't know,"" Hawley told Fox News Digital. ""The public sector unions and private sector unions seem to be two different things.""
The House of Representativespassed the bill last week with support from 20 GOP lawmakers — a rare feat for a vote that was essentially a direct rebuke of one of Trump’s policies.

Golden got a vote on his measure by filing a mechanism called a discharge petition. It is designed to force a vote on legislation over the wishes of leadership, provided it gets support from a majority of House lawmakers.
The final vote passed 231-195, with all the ""no"" votes coming from Republicans.
Such a mechanism does not exist in the Senate, but lawmakers could try to force a vote on the floor. That requires consent from Republicans, which is unlikely. But a source close to Golden told Fox News Digital that he was engaged in conversations with senators about getting enough support to press for a chamber-wide vote on his bill.
Golden told Fox News Digital on Friday that both he and Rep.Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., were in discussions with senators to try and win support.

He said he’d spoken with ""a few"" senators after the bill passed but added, ""the real push is gonna be coming in the days and weeks ahead.""
And Warner, who is pushing the companion to Golden’s bill in the Senate, told Fox News Digital in a statement that Republican defections in the lower chamber was a ""clear sign that these executive orders went way too far.""
""Republicans and Democrats alike are recognizing that you can’t run a functioning government by attacking the very workforce that keeps Americans safe,"" he said. ""The bipartisan momentum in the House only strengthens our hand in the Senate, and I intend to build on it.""

PresidentDonald Trumploves a good foil. For America’s sake, he should find his next one in my home state of Illinois.
Cook County — home of Chicago and most of the state’s leftist lunacy — hastaken the nation’s furthest steptoward a so-called universal basic income (UBI). Going forward, many low-income residents will permanently get monthly checks of $500. The goal is to help the poor stay on their feet, but in reality, the poor will stay poor and get more numerous. Not only should the president call out this injustice, but he should contrast it with his recent call to eliminate income taxes altogether. This may be Trump’s greatest opportunity for moral and economic leadership yet.
Make no mistake: A UBI is the left’s next national priority. It’s the epitome of their now-impenetrable belief that government alone should provide for people’s needs. Democrats have laid the groundwork for UBI, as it’s called, with refundable child tax credits during the pandemic andpilot programs across the country. The rise of artificial intelligence, with its threat of job losses, gives further momentum to leftists who say that government should give everyone enough money to get by. Even some on the right, like billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, have jumped aboard the UBI bandwagon.
COOK COUNTY IN ILLINOIS ESTABLISHES PERMANENT GUARANTEED INCOME PROGRAM
But UBI, like so much of thewelfare state, is a frontal assault on the human soul. It saps people’s willingness to develop and apply their inherent talents, making poverty a permanent way of life. While activists and media outlets unfailingly call programs like Cook County’s a ""success,"" real-world evidence shows their moral, economic and individual failure.

The recent pilot programs in Democratic cities caused fewer people to work. So did the refundable child tax credit. When the federal government tested an early version of UBI in the 1970s, recipientslost$5 in lifetime earnings for every taxpayer dollar they received.
Only one word can sum up UBI: evil. It’s morally wrong to steal people’s drive to make the most of their life. It’s inhumane to replace the ladder of opportunity with a cot. At its core, UBI encourages people to tolerate an unhappy existence instead of finding fulfillment through striving, succeeding and contributing to society.
But as Cook County shows, UBI has political momentum. The best way to beat such a bad idea is with a better idea. A transformative idea that not only highlights the injustice, but shows a real path forward. That’s where Trump comes in, especially his idea to eliminate income taxes.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The president made this comment flippantly after a Cabinet meeting on Dec. 2, saying that income taxes won’t be needed because of tariff revenue. But the real case for killing income taxes is that, like UBI, they also stifle work and limit its rewards. He could frame ending income taxes as giving every American the ""universal right to earn,"" while directly contrasting it with a universal basic income.
PROGRESSIVE CITIES GAMBLE WITH UNIVERSAL INCOME WHILE INFLATION THREAT LOOMS
Without income taxes, every American would keep every penny of what they earn, full stop. There’s no greater spur to work, to innovate, to start a small business — to do all the things that move individuals and the entire nation forward. The universal right to earn would unleash a new era of growth and wealth creation, benefiting the least fortunate the most. Why? Because it taps into every person’s innate desire to strive and rise. Contrast that with a universal income, which traps people in poverty.

Americans aren’t used to hearing such bold vision or languagefrom Republicans, but if any politician can make a strong case, it’s Donald Trump. In fact, the president could go even further rhetorically, while still staying on firm moral grounds. At its core, taxing labor is a form of slavery, since it takes away the fruits of man’s labor. The 13th Amendment banned slavery, but the 16th Amendment reinstated a sliver of it by allowing income taxes. Donald Trump could easily say: For America’s 250th birthday, we should end this injustice once and for all and finally realize our national promise.
I freely acknowledge that eliminating income taxes is a gargantuan political lift. The chances of success are miniscule. But the same was once true of a universal basic income. Now it’s a fact of life in Cook County, and it will surely be Democrats’ top priority the next time they control the White House and Congress. Someone has to provide an alternative vision — one that actually uplifts the poorest Americans, instead of shackling them in poverty forever. President Trump, the universal right to earn is in your hands.

FIRST ON FOX:Seeking to tackle persistent cost pressures on American families and small firms, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is unveiling a new initiative that will review and roll back federal rules the administration says have driven up prices in sectors ranging fromhousingto food production.
The Deregulation Strike Force, led by the SBA’s Office of Advocacy, will coordinate a government-wide review aimed at identifying regulations that hinder economic growth.

Trump administration officials say the effort is intended to eliminate what they describe as excessive Biden-era regulations that have imposed an estimated $6 trillion in cumulative compliance costs on American families and small businesses.
""Bidenomics brought historic new highs in inflation that crushed working families and small businesses, driven in part by the massive bureaucracy that heaped trillions in new federal regulations onto the backs of hardworking Americans,"" SBA AdministratorKelly Loefflerwrote in a statement.

""Through our Deregulation Strike Force, SBA is leveraging its unique authority to deregulate across the federal government and cut senseless red tape that drove up costs for small businesses and consumers, especially in industries hit hardest by Bidenflation,"" Loeffler said, adding that the initiative will build on President Trump’s push to reduce costs across the country.

Citing what it describes as four years of excessive regulatory overreach, the SBA said its strike force will target cuts across key small-business sectors, includinghousing and construction, healthcare, agriculture and food production, energy and utilities, transportation and other goods and services across the supply chain.
They also argue the latest deregulation campaign reinforces PresidentDonald Trump'seconomic message heading into the new year, positioning regulatory relief as a central tool for tackling high prices.

The SBA said it has already played a key role in eliminating an estimated $98.9 billion in federal regulations since Trump's return to office.
Some of these actions include changes to reporting rules, energy-efficiency standards and diesel exhaust fluid requirements, which the agency says have contributed to nearly $200 billion in total regulatory savings.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/california-broke-its-not-too-late-rest-us,"California is broke, but it’s not too late for the rest of us","Gov. Gavin Newsom said during a podcast interview that homelessness and poverty are the ""poster child"" for the state's failures on Wednesday.
California used to be the place where people went to chase dreams. Today, it’s the place where fiscal discipline goes to die. The Golden State, which is home to Hollywood glitz, Silicon Valley billionaires and the highest state taxes in America, is broke again. It's staring down another multibillion-dollar deficit that exposes just how unstable and dysfunctional its financial model has become. In short, the Golden State isn’t so golden anymore.
For years, politicians like Democrat Gov.Gavin Newsomhave insisted that California is the shining example of fiscal sensibility that America should follow. But when you peel back the layers, what you really find is a state government that can’t stop spending, can’t plan for the future and is now caught in a structural budget crisis of its own making.
This year, California’s nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office (LAO) dropped a bombshell: the state is now projected to face an $18 billion deficit in 2026–27, a shortfall $5 billion worse than what lawmakers admitted just months earlier. Even more troubling, the LAO says California is facing structural deficits of $15 to $25 billion every year through at least 2029.
This isn’t a one-off crisis for California. It’s a multiyear budget mess that keeps getting deeper. And this is happening during strong stock-market years when capital-gains tax revenue is already at record levels. Imagine what happens when the market cools or when we hit a mild recession.

California’s problem is simple:
Rather than tightening belts or prioritizing necessities, lawmakers have layered on new programs, expanded benefits and made long-term promises based on temporary revenue spikes. Newsom and legislative leaders have hailed these expansions as ""investments,"" but the truth is they are obligations that don’t disappear when the economy dips.
NEWSOM CALLS HOMELESSNESS AND POVERTY 'POSTER CHILD' OF CALIFORNIA'S FAILURES AS A STATE
Some of the biggest drivers of the fiscal crisis include:

Instead of addressing these realities, politicians have spent years using accounting gimmicks, fund transfers, delayed payments and borrowing from special accounts to mask the red ink. The LAO now warns that these ""one-time solutions"" have mostly been exhausted.
Governor Newsom has spent years painting California as a progressive Utopia that should be a ""model for America"" that proves big government can work. But you can’t call yourself the model when you:
Rather than tightening belts or prioritizing necessities, lawmakers have layered on new programs, expanded benefits and made long-term promises based on temporary revenue spikes.
California is now living paycheck to paycheck ironically, just like millions of Californians who can’t keep up with the state’s affordability crisis.
While California sinks deeper into red ink, fiscally disciplined states across the country are announcing surpluses, refunding taxpayers, or increasing reserves.
In other words, the states that California politicians love to criticize are the ones balancing their checkbooks.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gen-z-struggling-survive-and-republicans-cant-afford-look-away,Gen Z is struggling to survive — and Republicans can't afford to look away,"Personal finance expert Dave Ramsey discusses America’s affordability crisis, rising Gen Z and millennial debt and what falling gas prices mean for family budgets.
Young Americans’ apathy toward theRepublican Partyis not ideological;itcomes from the simple fact that they can no longer afford to dream. They were raised on a basic American covenant: work hard, graduate, land a good-paying job, buy a home and start a family. But the gateway to that dream is a stable income, and for millions, that’s no longer attainable. Youth unemployment is at 10.4% — more than double the national average — andhousing costshave exploded by 47% since 2020. A generation that did everything we told them would lead to the American Dream now confronts an economy where the math does not add up.
For millions of Gen Z voters, economic participation is becoming aspirational rather than achievable. They are building advanced skills shaped by AI, working longer hours in a volatile labor market, yet facing stagnant wages and financial insecurity far worse than their predecessors. And the problem is not their work ethic; it’s theeconomic rules written in Washington.
The Republican Party is dead wrong if it assumes young voters are rejecting conservatism. They reject a system they believe is working against their ability to achieve theAmerican Dream. Before the 2024 election, 58% of Gen Z and younger millennials were unsure they would vote because they believed neither party understood their economic reality or offered younger candidates. Youth turnout ultimately fell below 2020 levels.
YOUNG AMERICANS GIVE BIG THUMBS DOWN TO DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, TRUMP: POLL
The newestHarvard Youth Poll reinforceswhy: 56% of young Americans say the country is headed in the wrong direction. They look at Washington and see a political class governing like it’s a senior center while they’re trying to survive in the most expensive economy of their lives.
When a hardworking 26-year-old with a degree and two jobs still can’t afford an apartment without a roommate, they don’t blame capitalism — they blame the policymakers and executives who engineered an economy they can’t enter.
They see corporations lobbying toexpand the H-1B pipelineunder the false claim of a ""worker shortage,"" knowing it suppresses wages and slows innovation. They see fewer openings, lower pay and no entry point on the career ladder. And they watch multinational firms distort the housing market and drive prices far beyond what entry-level wages can sustain. They no longer see a free market.
FAITH IN AMERICAN DREAM DWINDLES AMID SOUR ECONOMIC SENTIMENTS, POLL FINDS
Gen Z men supported Trump by a 14-point margin in 2024. They rejected identity politics and believed in an America First vision where hard work would finally pay off again. They still believe in that vision, but they are losing patience with Republican leaders who talk about culture while ignoring wages, affordability and the economic hardships defining their lives. Too many in our party dismiss these concerns as entitlement, forgetting they were elected to represent the American worker.
The Republican Party has a choice: lecture young Americans about resilience while ignoring the economic crisis in front of them, or deliver a realignment that gives them a path back to the American Dream.
The housing crisis hasbecome its own form of disenfranchisement. The average first-time homebuyer is now 40 years old, an age when previous generations were already building stability.
Young Americans are either delayed or denied the chance to begin their path to the American Dream. And if conservatism claims to stand for that dream, then it must build the economic conditions that make it possible. Otherwise, it’s lip service and we’ll lose an entire generation.

Anyone calling Gen Z entitled should try enteringtoday’s housing marketon a $48,000 salary whilecompeting with foreign laborand cash-rich corporate buyers. The deck is stacked against them, and it’s obvious it’s exclusionary.
The Republican Party has a choice: lecture young Americans about resilience while ignoring the economic crisis in front of them, or deliver a realignment that gives them a path back to the American Dream.
That means putting American workers ahead of foreign labor bytightening H-1B abuseand incentivizing companies to invest in domestic talent; reopening entry-level access through apprenticeships; restoring wage growth by ending loopholes that allow corporations to bypass American labor; and reclaiming the first-home market from corporate and foreign buyers so young Americans can finally buy in.
It means making AI an engine of opportunity rather than displacement and cutting the regulatory barriers that shut young entrepreneurs out before they begin.

Republicans won this generation once. And we can do it again only if we are willing to rebuild an economy worthy of their ambition. If we refuse to confront the forces crushing young Americans, we will lose them for decades.
This generation is ready to work hard, build and dream. The real question is whether Republican leaders have the courage to build a country that finally believes in them.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-democrat-pushes-senate-reverse-trump-federal-union-order-after-gop-revolt-20-republicans,House Democrat pushes Senate to reverse Trump federal union order after GOP revolt by 20 Republicans,"Mark Ross, president of the St. Paul Police Federation, says Minnesota is facing a thousand-officer shortage and warns that fraud, underfunding and political pressures are undermining public safety.
EXCLUSIVE:Bipartisan House lawmakers are actively lobbying the Senate to take action on a bill reversing PresidentDonald Trump'sexecutive order on federal worker unions, a moderate Democrat said.
Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, successfully forced a vote on his legislation Thursday evening despite little appetite from the majority of House Republicans. It passed, however, with20 GOP lawmakers’ support— a significant number at a time when few in the party are willing to publicly butt heads with Trump.
""When I said on the House floor that union collective bargaining rights are not a partisan issue, I meant it,"" Golden told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview. ""The greatest evidence of that is union members themselves. They vote Democrat, they vote Republican. They don't all vote, but they might vote if they knew that someone supported their collective bargaining rights.""
Golden introducedhis billin April, and a companion was brought forward in the Senate in September. It has support from two Republicans as of now — Sens. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Susan Collins, R-Maine — the latter of which appeared to sign on after House passage on Thursday evening.

""I didn't talk to her last night, but I'm really glad to see her on. It's not a surprise to me. She's supported unions on certain issues in the past, so she's obviouslya very important senator,"" said Golden, who worked for Collins before coming to Congress himself.
He did say he had spoken with ""a few"" senators after the bill passed but added, ""the real push is gonna be coming in the days and weeks ahead.""
And Golden is not lobbying senators alone — he said Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a moderate Republican who championed the bill in the House, is working alongside him.
Fox News Digital reached out to Fitzpatrick’s office for comment.
""As you probably saw, it was a long process in the House, so you’ve got to stay dogged and be patient. It's important to do it in a way that's bipartisan, to create space for members of both parties to work together,"" Golden said. ""I made sure all along that the Republican co-sponsors of the bill were comfortable with our messaging and also the steps that we were taking, so it's gonna need to be just like that in the Senate, too.""
Golden said he expected more Republican senators to sign on in the coming days.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., for instance, has not backed the legislation as of Friday afternoon, but Golden said he was a ""great example"" of someone who’s ""shown himself to be pro-labor.""
58 HOUSE DEMS VOTE AGAINST RESOLUTION HONORING 'LIFE AND LEGACY' OF CHARLIE KIRK
Hawley has also previously introduced his own bipartisan pro-union legislation earlier this year that would speed up the labor contract process for new unions. That bill is endorsed by Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien, a friend of the lawmaker’s.
Fox News Digital reached out to Collins, Murkowski and Hawley’s offices for further comment.
Golden got his bill passed by filing it as adischarge petition, which isdesigned to force a vote on legislation over the wishes of leadership, provided it gets support from a majority of House lawmakers.
Discharge petitions are rarely successful in the House but have been used more frequently this year as Republicans grapple with a razor-thin majority.
In Golden's case, five House Republicans had signed onto the petition along with 213 Democrats — Fitzpatrick and Reps. Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., Don Bacon, R-Neb., Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Nick LaLota, R-N.Y.
Meanwhile, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., introduced the companion version of Golden’s legislation in September. He said in a statement to Fox News Digital, ""The bipartisan momentum in the House only strengthens our hand in the Senate, and I intend to build on it.""

Collins, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Golden have a relationship that dates back to his first time in Washington, D.C., not as a lawmaker, but as a staffer for the longtime Maine senator. They’re also both known to buck their respective parties.
Just before Golden’s successful vote, Collins joined Senate Democrats to back their three-year extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies.
But Warner’s bill has sat in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen.Rand Paul, for several months. Whether it will survive committee is unclear, given that Paul has introduced several right-to-work bills over the years.
Republican opponents of the bill have said federal workers' unions are not the same as labor unions in the private sector, arguing that collective bargaining is a different scenario when working against Americans' own elected officials rather than for-profit companies.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-state-lawmakers-blame-big-tech-pressure-after-ny-gov-hochul-severely-scales-back-ai-safety-legislation,Dem lawmakers cry foul as Hochul guts AI safety bill amid Big Tech pressure,"Fox News anchor Bret Baier explores how technology is changing how the world operates on 'Special Report.'
New York State Assemblyman Alex Bores, D-73, who is leading an effort to enact tighter safety regulations in the state for the country’s largest artificial intelligence developers, has attributed pressure from Big Tech to Gov. Kathy Hochul’s decision to rewrite his bill.
Just before PresidentDonald Trumpsigned an executive order aimed at undercutting state-level AI regulations, news broke that Hochul had severely watered down a state-level bill targeting some of the industry's biggest players, attempting to force them to implement stricter safety measures.
Her amendments reportedly mirrored a California measure more favorable to major AI firms.
In response to Bores' work on the bill, the RAISE Act, the progressive state lawmaker who is running for Congress to replace Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., says he has been the target of a $100 million ad campaign bankrolled by some of the biggest leaders in the AI industry, such as OpenAI President Greg Brockman and the major AI venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.
TRUMP SAYS EVERY AI PLANT BEING BUILT IN US WILL BE SELF-SUSTAINING WITH THEIR OWN ELECTRICITY
""My reaction was, ‘Oh, this is a message to the governor’ — this is not just about defeating me,"" Bores told Rolling Stone after Hochul amended his bill. ""They want the governor to be intimidated by the idea they might target her next.""

""NY can be a leader on critical AI safety, or we can cave to the pressure of the same Big Tech and VC bullies pushing Trump’s AI safety ban,"" New York State Sen. Andrew Gounardes, D-26, the Senate sponsor of the RAISE Act, said on X. ""I know which side I’m fighting on.""
The RAISE Act, in its original form, sought to compel a select few of the most advanced AI developers to implement specific safety protocols, including requirements to write detailed safety and security protocols that must then be followed, report incidents of serious harm within 72 hours to the New York attorney general and a prohibition on the release of new models that could pose ""unreasonable risk.""
But Hochul's rewrite removed the prohibition on new AI models that could pose ""unreasonable"" risk, extended the reporting threshold to 15 days and weakened penalties against AI companies, among other revisions that scaled back the bill’s restrictions.
KYRSTEN SINEMA WARNS US ADVERSARY WILL PROGRAM AI WITH 'CHINESE VALUES' IF AMERICA FALLS BEHIND IN TECH RACE
""AI oligarchs want to take over our safety, our workforce and our minds for their own personal profit and power,"" Bores told Fox News Digital when reached for comment. ""They’ve already bought the White House and are trying very aggressively to try to buy statehouses, too. That can’t happen, and I won’t let it.""
Some tech experts, including TechNYC's Julie Samuels, argue that aligning the RAISE Act with California's standards is actually a wise move because it will ""help create a de facto national standard"" that does not exist.

When reached for comment, Hochul's office pointed to an ""absence of federal leadership on responsible AI"" and asserted that New York has been ""leading with commonsense laws to protect children, families and consumers.""
""Our approach should be a model for the nation,"" a Hochul spokesperson said. ""Gov. Hochul has been at the forefront of the innovation economy and remains committed to advancing AI responsibly as she reviews the legislation.""

On Thursday, not long after news broke of Hochul's rewrite, Trump signed an executive order aimed at creating a federal regulatory framework that would undercut state regulatory efforts on AI. During the signing ceremony from theWhite HouseThursday evening, Trump said he thinks there will only be ""one winner"" in the global AI arms race, likely the U.S. or China.
Trump said China holds an advantage because of its centralized regulatory structure, while the U.S. ""has to get 50 different approvals from 50 different states,"" slowing development of new AI centers.

WH blames Biden-era ‘damage’,"Fox News anchor Bret Baier takes a closer look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's impact on gas prices in America on 'Special Report.'
The Trump administration is in the midst of ""gradually"" refilling the nation's emergencyreserve of oilafter it was partially drained under the Biden administration.
PresidentDonald Trumpand the White House have been touting falling energy and oil prices in recent months as Democrats realign their political messaging following their 2024 election losses, finding a winning strategy in knocking the Trump administration over ""affordability"" and cost-of-living concerns.
Considering the administration is touting falling gas prices as they champion Trump's economic plans in the face of Democrat ""affordability"" pushback, Fox News Digital asked the White House Wednesday if the administration was taking steps to refill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), which Trump pledged to do from the campaign trail and during inauguration.
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve serves as the U.S.' emergency stash of oil that was established after the 1970s oil crisis and stored along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana. The Department of Energy oversees the reserve.

A Trump official explained that the administration is working to ""gradually"" refill the stash of oil, while citing significant ""damage"" left to the reserve following the Biden administration releasing millions of barrels of oil in 2021 and 2022.
""Joe Biden’s disastrous green energy policies sent gas prices soaring across the country, making the past four years painfully unaffordable for Americans filling their gas tanks to commute to work, take their children to school, and travel during the summer and holiday seasons,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital.
""In a desperate attempt to provide an illusion of relief during his 2024 campaign, Joe Biden irresponsibly depleted our Strategic Petroleum Reserve — shamelessly jeopardizing our economic and national security. President Trump’s energy dominance agenda has already brought gas prices down across the country, while gradually replenishing the SPR, and they will continue to drop as we unleash American energy.""
Biden released 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 2021 to lower gas prices and address the nation's supply chain issues, citing the move was needed after the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a ""near economic standstill.""
He upped the ante on draining the SPR in March 2022, announcing that his administration would release one million barrels of oil per day from the SPR for six months to combat rising gas prices. The announcement followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, with the U.S. and other allies imposing steep sanctions on oil-rich Russia in response. Biden released roughly 300 million barrels of oil across his four years.
The U.S. uses about 20.2 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to theEnergy Information Administration, so the roughly 400 million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve would cover only about 20 days of demand if it were the country’s sole source of crude.
TRUMP COMPARES REAL WAGES UNDER HIS ADMIN VERSUS BIDEN'S DURING SPEECH CALLING OUT DEM AFFORDABILITY 'HOAX'
Biden holds the top spot among presidents for releasing the most oil from the SPR, with his administration acknowledging at the time that it was ""unprecedented"" but needed to lower energy prices. SPR levels dropped to a 40-year low of 347 million barrels in July 2023 after the drawdowns in 2021 and 2022, compared to its record high at 727 million barrels under the Obama administration in 2009.
""The scale of this release is unprecedented: the world has never had a release of oil reserves at this 1 million per day rate for this length of time,"" the Biden administration said in astatement at the time, pinning blame for the prices on Russia. ""This record release will provide a historic amount of supply to serve as bridge until the end of the year when domestic production ramps up.""
Other presidents have released oil from the reserve, including the President George H.W. Bush administration releasing 17.3 million barrels in 1991 during Operation Desert Storm, and the President George W. Bush administration ordering an 11 million barrel drawdown in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina rocked the Gulf Coast.

A Trump administration official told Fox Digital that the ""repercussions of this damaging decision"" to release roughly 300 million barrels of oil ""persist.""
The official said that releasing the oil under the Biden administration sparked $280 million incosts, delayed critical infrastructure maintenance, and put ""unprecedented"" wear and tear on storage and injection facilities.
The SPR currently holds just more than 400 million barrels, with a capacity of roughly 700 million barrels, Fox Digital learned. Refiling the reserve could cost up to $20 billion, according to the administration official, who underscored that the ""damage the Biden administration did to America’s SPR and national security cannot be overstated.""
The SPR notched its lowest levels in modern history under the Biden administration, though the reserve only held just a few million barrels of oil in the late 1970s and early 1980s as officials worked tofill the reserve.
Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's office for comment on the SPR and Trump administration's comments but did not immediately receive a reply.
After Biden’s record 2022 emergency drawdown, the Biden–Harris administration directed the Energy Department to start repurchasing crude for the SPR at prices well below the roughly $95 per barrel it sold forin 2022.
Congress needs to appropriate funds in order to refill the reserves. Currently, the Department of Energy has refill authority and funds granted under the ""big, beautiful bill,"" which appropriated $218 million for maintenance and repairs to the storage facilities and $171 million to refill the SPR.
Appetite amongRepublicansto refill the SPR was apparent earlier in 2025, when House GOP lawmakers unveiled a budget proposal in May that included more than $1.5 billion to replenish and maintain the SPR. The funding was whittled down amid negotiations on the funding bill.

The Trump administration told Fox Digital that the Energy Department and Trump are working to gradually refill the reserve and remain committed to their previous pledges to do so, while awaiting additional funding from Congress.
The Department of Energy began refilling the SPR in October, Fox Digital learned, in October with a notice of intent to purchase a million barrels of oil, which was followed by the department awarding contracts to begin refilling the reserve. The Department of Energy expects that oil to be delivered to the reserves by the end of 2025.
'PRICES ARE COMING DOWN': TRUMP HAILS HIS ECONOMY, BLAMES BIDEN AS VOTERS SAY COSTS STILL STING
The administration said it is examining other avenues to refill the reserves as it awaits further funding action from Congress, including exchanging 1 million barrels to ExxonMobil in July to address a temporary supply disruption at its Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery. Exxon will return the oil, plus an additional amount that will be returned under a negotiated schedule by the third quarter of fiscal year 2026.
Trump railed against Biden's plan and subsequent release of the oil in his interim between his first and second administration, including in 2021 when he told the New York Post that the reserve should only be tapped during ""serious emergencies, like war, and nothing else.""
""Now I understand that Joe Biden will be announcing an ‘attack’ on the newly brimming Strategic Oil Reserves so that he could get the close to record-setting high oil prices artificially lowered,"" Trump told the outlet at the time. ""We were energy independent one year ago, now we are at the mercy of OPEC, gasoline is selling for $7 in parts of California, going up all over the Country, and they are taking oil from our Strategic Reserves. Is this any way to run a Country?""

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt Thursday, during a press briefing, celebrated the nation's current falling gas prices as evidence that the Trump economy is easing the financial anxiety Americans are feeling.
Democrats in the off-season 2025 election cycle campaigned on the platform of ""affordability,"" claiming the Trump administration was worsening cost-of-living woes. The president and his administration have hit back against the Democrats' new winning campaign strategy, pinning blame for high costs on Biden administration policies that have had a lasting effect on the economy.
""American families faced constant pain at the pump, and those costs caused the price of everything else to go up as well,"" Leavitt said Thursday. ""In fact, the average cost for a gallon of regular gas in the country was the most expensive price during a presidential term in U.S. history under Biden's disastrous leadership, even with them recklessly draining our strategic reserves to try and artificially decrease prices. But thanks to President Trump, those days are long behind us. In the months ahead, Americans can expect prices to fall even further.""",12/12/2025

HUD said it has evidence Boston used federal grant assistance for ""race-based preferences,"" in violation of the Fair Housing Act and Title VI, describing the initiatives as a ""social engineering project.""
""We believe theCity of Bostonhas engaged in a social engineering project that intentionally advances discriminatory housing policies driven by an ideological commitment to DEI rather than merit or need,"" HUD Secretary Scott Turner said in a statement.

The investigation came after HUD sent a letter to the Mayor’s Office of Housing, alerting city officials that it had ""reason to believe"" Boston was improperly using its federal grant assistance.
According to HUD, Boston’s Fair Housing Assessment promises to ""target homebuyer outreach"" at ""Black and Latinx families"" and charges city departments with collecting racial and ethnic data ""to evaluate their work through a racial equity/social justice lens.""
Boston’s Housing Strategy 2025 also states that ""at least 65%"" of homeownership opportunities through city initiatives should go to BIPOC (Black, indigenous, and people of color) households, according to HUD.
""The policy is clear,"" the agency stated. ""Financial housing assistance is not just for all low-income persons but instead ‘particularly BIPOC residents.’""

When reached for comment, a city spokesperson told Fox News Digital that ""Boston will never abandon our commitment to fair and affordable housing, and we will defend our progress to keep Bostonians in their homes against these unhinged attacks from Washington.""

Twenty House Republicans joined Democrats to pass a bill reversing PresidentDonald Trump'sexecutive order blocking most federal unions on Thursday.
The bill was led by Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine, who got a vote on his measure by filing a discharge petition. It's designed to force a vote on legislation over the wishes of leadership provided it gets support from a majority of House lawmakers.
The bill, called the Protect America's Workforce Act, is aimed at repealing a March 2025 executive order by Trump.
The final vote passed 231 to 195, with all the ""no"" votes coming from Republicans.

Trump's order blocked collective bargaining with unions at an array offederal agencies, including parts of the departments of Defense, State, Veterans Affairs, Justice and Energy.
It also affected workers at thedepartments of Homeland Security(DHS), Treasury, Health and Human Services (HHS), Interior and Agriculture.
During debate on the bill Thursday afternoon, House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., said undoing Trump's executive order was akin to encouraging ""more work-from-home policies for our federal employees,"" which he said Americans voted against when they elected Trump and Republicans to lead in Washington.
""It is important to remember that public sector unions are fundamentally different from their private sector counterparts,"" Comer also argued. ""In fact, none other than Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a major champion of private sector unions, believed that public sector unions made no sense.""
""In the private sector, unions represent workers and sit across the bargaining table from representatives of business owners. However, federal unions are not negotiating with a profit-seeking corporation. They are negotiating with the public's elected representatives.""
Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, said, ""Union bosses love this bill for one reason, and that's because it protects their telework perks, it shields them from accountability, and gives them effective veto power over a duly elected president with a mandate to clean up a bloated federal bureaucracy.""

Golden said in his own statement when the bill passed, ""Federal workers show up on the job every day to do the people’s work, and their limited collective bargaining rights are critical to protecting them from unfair treatment and political interference.""
Meanwhile House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., argued, ""Collective bargaining is essentially the freedom to negotiate the best possible work environment.""
""I'm thankful for this bipartisan effort to restore collective bargaining rights for more than 1 million public servants that are part of our federal government,"" Jeffries said.
Rep. Rob Bresnahan, R-Pa., who said his district was home to thousands of federal workers, argued that restoring collective bargaining rights for those workers is ""a lifeline that ensures fair wages, safe workplaces, and the basic dignity that every worker deserves,"" including corrections officers and people who work with veterans and seniors.
Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., also appeared on the House floor to debate in favor of the bill, arguing, ""These are career public servants, many of them veterans who show up every single day to serve our country. Every American deserves a voice in the workplace, and that includes the people who keep our government running and open.""
Discharge petitions are rarely successful in the House but have been used more frequently this year as Republicans grapple with a razor-thin majority.

In Golden's case, five House Republicans had signed onto the petition along with 213 Democrats — Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., Bresnahan, Don Bacon, R-Neb., Lawler and Nick LaLota, R-N.Y.

A vote to advance the billwon support from13 Republicans on Wednesday night, setting it up for the Thursday vote.
That number grew early on Thursday afternoon during another procedural vote to set up final passage, with 22 Republicans voting to push the bill to its final step.
To be successful, however, the measure would still have to be taken up successfully in the Senate and get signed into law by Trump.

White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittclashed with reporters over inflation during Thursday's briefing, accusing CNN's Kaitlan Collins of trying to ""push narratives.""
Collins pressed Leavitt to explain PresidentDonald Trump's apparent mixed messaging regarding the economy, saying at one time that it was booming while at other times recommending parents pare back on Christmas gifts.
""Inflation is down from where it was. As measured by the overall CPI, it has slowed to an average 2.5% pace,"" Leavitt said as Collins began to try to interject.
""This is down from what the president inherited. The president inherited 2.9% in January. Today, it's at about 2.5%, so we're trending in the right direction,"" Leavitt continued. ""And I would remind you, when President Trump left office in his first term, inflation was 1.7%, and the previous administration jacked it up to a record-high 9%.""

""In 10 months, the president has clawed us out of this hole, he's kept it low at 2.5%, and we believe that number is going to continue to decline,"" Leavitt added.
""Nobody is saying it wasn't high under Biden,"" Collins argued. ""They're just saying virtually [unchanged].""
""Nobody reported it on being high under Biden. My predecessor was standing up here at this podium, but now you want to ask me a lot of questions about it, which I'm happy to answer, but I will just add, there's a lot more scrutiny on this issue from this press corps than there was,"" Leavitt said.

The legislation will now be debated in the House before a final vote. It must then be taken up and approved in the Senate and head to Trump's desk for his signature to be enacted.

FIRST ON FOX–Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced Wednesday he is suing Starbucks, alleging the company uses racial discrimination and illegal hiring quotas.
""I​​’m announcing that my office is suing Starbucks for usingDEI policiesthat cross the line into illegal, race-based quotas,"" Uthmeier said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.
The lawsuitalleges that in 2020, Starbucks said its ""diverse representation goals"" were to ""hire ‘people of color’ in 40% of retail and distribution center jobs and 30% of corporate jobs by 2025.""

It also allegesthat Starbucks""pays employees of certain favored races higher wages than employees belonging to disfavored races who have the same experience and skill"" and that before March 2024, the company ""openly conditioned executive bonuses on an executive’s ability to meet specific diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.""
For example, for fiscal year 2024, an executive’s bonus pay was allegedly tied to executives mentoring BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and people of color) mentees, which included leading monthly group meetings with mentees and monthly meetings with individual mentees, as well as retaining BIPOC employees.
According to the lawsuit, BIPOC retention had to remain over 87% for an executive to make at least half of an offered bonus.
The complaint also claims that people who live in Florida who applied to work at Starbucks stores in the state or who already worked at them ""contacted the Attorney General last year and reported that they felt or were excluded, and even suffered humiliation, because they are White.""
The lawsuit also says that Starbucks engages in ""systemic discrimination"" against ""non-diverse"" workers.

""Starbucks made DEI more than a slogan,"" Uthmeier said. ""They turned it into a mandatory hiring and promotion system based on race. The coffee empire set numerical racial targets for their workforce — and they tied executive bonuses to hitting those targets. That is not diversity. That is discrimination, and in Florida, it is against the law.""
Efforts for the lawsuitbegan in 2024under then-Florida Attorney GeneralAshley Moody, now Sen. Ashley Moody, R-Fla.
""DEI can never be an excuse to violate someone’s civil rights,"" Uthmeier said. ""Every worker in our state deserves to be hired on merit, qualifications and character — not skin color. Florida law protects that principle, and we will enforce it. If a corporation weaponizes DEI to impose illegal racial quotas, Florida will hold them accountable.""
Uthmeier is requesting damages of $10,000 ""for each instance of racial discrimination that Starbucks is committing or has committed against a Florida resident,"" which the attorney general estimates could total ""tens of millions of dollars, if not more.""

A Starbucks spokesperson told Fox News Digital in a statement, ""We disagree. We are deeply committed to creating opportunity for every single one of our partners (employees). Our programs and benefits are open to everyone and lawful. Our hiring practices are inclusive, fair and competitive, and designed to ensure the strongest candidate for every job, every time.""
The Florida Commission on Human Relationsfound last yearthere was ""no reasonable cause"" that Starbucks had violated the anti-discrimination law, after then-Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody filed a complaint at the time.

FIRST ON FOX:A Senate Republican wants to lower the costs of eggs by loosening certain regulations as the nation deals with growing affordability concerns.
Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., plans to introduce a bill that would tweakfederal egg-handling rulesto allow more to enter the market in a bid to lower prices of the household staple.
Cotton’s bill, the Lowering Egg Prices Act of 2025, first obtained by Fox News Digital would update federal egg-handling rules to make it easier for surplus broiler hatching eggs — fertile eggs originally intended for broiler chicken production — to be diverted into the food supply as pasteurized liquid egg products.

""Arkansas consumers have paid higheregg pricesand faced egg shortages because of bureaucratic red tape that forces farmers to throw out hundreds of millions of usable eggs each year,"" Cotton said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""My bill will cut these excessive regulations and lower egg prices.""
The legislationwould require that the Food and Drug Administration, in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, rewrite its egg rules so that eggs intended to be hatched could also enter into the food supply as a liquid egg product, effectively creating a regulatory glide path to bolster the number of eggs in the supply chain.

Egg prices had steadily inched upward late last year into earlier this year, reaching record highs by March of more than $6 per dozen eggs. But the cost of eggs has since been steadily dropping, thanks in part to efforts by PresidentDonald Trumpand his administration to combat the effects of avian flu.
If thevirus is detectedin a hatchery, the entire flock is generally killed to halt its spread. Doing so can put a dent in the supply chain, and cause prices to creep up.

There were a spate of lawsuits against egg producers for alleged price fixing this year and notably, the Trump administration sued the state of California for allegedly going against federal law and increasing egg prices with red tape.
But egg prices have trended downward since the record highs earlier this year. According to the USDA’s most recentegg markets overview, egg prices during the first week of December dropped overall, save in some markets like California. Large white eggs, for example, dropped by roughly 17% to an average of $1.91 per dozen egg.

Real wages were among one of the several statistics that Trump shared with voters Tuesday to prove how much better the economy is under him than Biden. According to Trump, real wages ""plummeted"" by $3,000 under Biden, while under Trump's second administration, the president said, the typical factory worker has seen their real wages increase by $1,300, construction workers by over $1,800 and miners by $3,300. Trump added that, under Biden, real wages for construction workers dropped by $3,500.
To put things into perspective for the audience, Trump also touched on the price of everyday goods and shared charts with the audience showing how the prices differed under his predecessor's term. Citing a report from Walmart, Trump said thecost of a full Thanksgiving meal,trimmings, turkey and all, is 25% cheaper under his administration than it was under Biden. He said the price of Thanksgiving turkeys specifically was also down 33%.
Trump added that egg prices have ""dropped like a rock"" under his second term, noting their price point is down 80% since March.

Hours before PresidentDonald Trumpwas set to deliver a highly anticipated speech on the economy and affordability, a new national poll indicated the president's approval is on the rise, thanks in part to soaring support by Republicans.
Trump's approval rating in a Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted Dec. 3–8 and released on Tuesday stood at 41%, with 57% disapproving.
That's an improvement from mid-November, when the president stood at 38%-60% approval/disapproval in the previous Reuters/Ipsos national poll.
Trump's focus onlowering priceshelped boost him and Republicans to sweeping victories last year, when the GOP won back the White House and Senate and successfully defended their House majority.

But Democrats are energized following decisive victories last month inthe 2025 electionsand in their over-performance last week in a special congressional election in Tennessee, as they hammered Republicans over affordability as prices have remained elevated this year.
The most recent Labor Department report, from September, indicated inflation increased 3% from a year earlier, up slightly from 2.9% in August.

Although combating high prices remains one of Trump's weakest polling issues, the new survey indicates the president's approval on dealing with the cost of living jumped from 26% last month to 31% now. The rise was fueled by a 10-point jump among Republicans.
TheReuters/Ipsos survey, which was conducted online, questioned 4,434 respondents nationwide. It had an overall sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

While Trump has described the Democrats' focus on affordability as a ""hoax,"" he has also become more engaged in combating high prices in recent weeks, as the president has scaled back some of his tariffs and pledged to lower high food prices.
On Tuesday evening, Trump is scheduled to deliver his first major address on affordability, with a speech inbattleground Pennsylvania.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, in an interview with Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" on Tuesday morning, said that President Trump is going to give a positive, economic focused speech where he talks about all that he and his team has done to provide bigger paychecks and lower prices for the American people.""
Trump's approval rating stood at 41% in the most recentFox News national poll,which was conducted in mid-November. That's the lowest approval for the president during his second term in the White House.
Three-quarters of those questioned viewed the economy negatively. And by a nearly two-to-one margin, voters say Trump was more responsible for the current economy than former President Joe Biden.
Trump's overall approval rating has been in negative territory in nearly every national poll conducted since mid-October. Fueling those numbers are the president's approval ratings specifically on the economy.
But asked in an interview with Politico ahead of his speech what grade he would give the economy, Trump responded, ""A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hud-chief-blames-unchecked-illegal-immigration-pricing-out-families-amid-new-housing-report,HUD chief blames 'unchecked illegal immigration' pricing-out families amid new housing report,"Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner joins ‘Saturday in America’ to discuss how illegal immigration is fueling the housing crisis and pricing out young Americans.
EXCLUSIVE:Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner slammed the Biden administration for what he called an illegal immigration and refugee crisis that rattled the housing market – particularly for low-income renters – though some analysts dispute the findings.
Every two years, HUD releases its ""Worst Case Housing Needs Report"" – considered the agency’s flagship assessment of the state of the housing market for low-income Americans – and how many lack affordable and adequate housing. The report serves as a nationwide barometer of housing stress and shows whether the availability of affordable housing is improving or worsening, and who may be being hurt by the current conditions, which Congress can then use to craft policy.
Policymakers use it to gauge gaps in the supply of low-cost rentals, target federal housing programs, and understand trends in who is being left behind. In short, it’s HUD’s way of tracking the renters in the greatest need — and how the U.S. housing system is failing to meet them.
TRUMP’S HOUSING CHIEF RIPS POWELL FOR BLOWING MILLIONS ON FED FACELIFT DURING HOUSING CRISIS HE PERPETUATES

Turner told Fox News Digital there are damning findings in this year’s assessment that he places right on the policies of former PresidentJoe Biden’s immigration crisis.
""The unchecked illegal immigration and open borders policies allowed by the Biden administration continue to put significant strain on housing, pricing out American families,"" Turner said.
""These policies have plagued America’s housing market, but in President Trump, Americans finally have a leader fighting to restore sanity to American immigration policy.""
TRUMP'S DHS TOUTS MASSIVE NUMBER OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DEPORTED AS DEMS LASH OUT AT ICE
But Jenna Stauffer, Global Real Estate Advisor at Sotheby's International Realty of Key West, told Fox News Digital she didn't think immigration was the primary driver of the ""housing mess we are in.""
""Housing affordability has been unraveling for years, and the problems we’re dealing with go way beyond any one factor,"" she said.
""We’ve really been under building for almost two decades. After the Great Recession, construction basically stalled, and it took years to recover. By some estimates, the U.S. is short four to seven million homes, and that long-term shortage is the core issue behind today’s affordability challenges.""
HUD's 2025 report found that increased immigration has driven up housing prices, and that the ""unrestricted"" nature of the influx has both strained the housing market and priced-out many American families. The report found that an estimated 15 millionillegal immigrantsconstitute 30% of all foreign-born residents.
Turner added in separate comments to Fox Business that HUD took away Federal Housing Authority-backed mortgages from illegal immigrants offered during the Biden administration, saying the former president ""turned a blind eye"" to the issue.
In California and New York, immigrants have accounted for 100% of all rental growth and over one-half of all growth in owner-occupied housing in recent years, the report found – while nationally, theforeign-born populationaccounted for more than 60% of the growth in rental demand.
KRISTI NOEM SAYS BIDEN USED DHS 'TO INVADE THE COUNTRY WITH TERRORISTS'
Nationwide, the foreign-born population accounted for two-thirds of rental demand growth.
HUD’s report contrasted that figure with the 13% growth attributed to noncitizens in 2019 and 2023’s lookbacks.
""This further demonstrates that non-citizen households are playing an increasing role in the household growth that is straining the affordable housing supply,"" the 109-page report said.
NEW GOP BILL WOULD CUT OFF HOUSING FUNDS TO SANCTUARY CITIES DEFYING TRUMP DHS
The agency found that without the migrant surge, housing inventory pressures would have been far lower and prices would not have climbed as sharply, noting roughly 784,000 fewer households would have formed over that period.
Net additions to the housing market from 2015 onward have not kept up with ""household formation among citizens"" and non-citizen population growth has also inordinately affectedrental markets.
Worst-case housing reports have been released regularly since 1991, but the 2025 findings mark a sharper warning about the illegal immigration crisis’ impact on the numbers.
BIPARTISAN PLAN AIMS TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR MILLIONS OF FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS
In August, Turnerordered an audit of everypublic housing authority, seeking data on verifiable citizenship of those living in subsidized housing.
""No longer will illegal aliens be able to leave citizenship boxes blank or take advantage of HUD-funded housing, riding the coattails of hardworking American citizens,"" Turner said.
""Currently, HUD only serves one out of four eligible families due, in part, to the lack of enforcement of prohibition against federally funded assistance to illegal aliens,"" he continued.
TRUMP'S BORDER MIRACLE: FROM BIDEN'S CHAOTIC IMMIGRATION CRISIS TO 'ALL QUIET' IN RECORD TIME
Vice PresidentJD Vancehighlighted a recent comment from Turner – who had been responding to a CNBC report that rents have dropped for four straight months.
""Six months of zero illegals released into our country. Two million illegals removed. Rents dropped for the fourth straight month. Coincidence? I think not,"" Turner said.
Vance echoed what the agency ultimately would find in its report, remarking that the ""connection between illegal immigration and skyrocketing housing costs is as clear as day.""
SEC SCOTT TURNER: BLAME DRUGS AND MENTAL ILLNESS, NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR THE CHAOS GRIPPING OUR STREETS
HUD’s findings, as expressed by Turner and others prior to the official report, also had other critics.
Harvard Joint Center For Housing Studies senior research analyst Riordan Frost previously wrote that while the ""surge in immigration"" has affected the market, other factors like the coronavirus pandemic contributed to increases in housing costs during that time in history.
""Immigrants play a role in household growth, sometimes to a substantial degree, but housing demand during the pandemic has been primarily shaped by native-born household growth in a time of constrained housing supply,""Frost said.

""If you really believe that you would not slash your agency's budget by over 50%,"" she said.

Additionally, Rep.Maxine Waters, D-Calif., claimed earlier this year that Turner was ""abandoning HUD’s legal obligation to eliminate housing discrimination in the United States [a]t a time when America is experiencing a full-blown housing crisis and record levels of housing discrimination complaints.""

The Trump White House is facing a crisis over its economic messaging after Democrats swept a series of elections in November while campaigning on platforms focused on ""affordability,"" lowering the current cost-of-living prices skyrocketing from grocery store shelves to rent, while touting a vote for Democrats was a vote against Trump and his policies.
The Democratic election wins earlier in 2025 — which included the gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and the mayoral race in New York City — are viewed as a bellwether ahead of the 2026 midterms, lighting a spark among Republicans to fine-tune their messaging on the economy.

The White House and Trump increasingly have amplified blame for the current affordability woes on former PresidentJoe Biden'sleadership as voters' financial anxiety grows at peak holiday shopping season.
""Putting an end to Joe Biden’s inflation and affordability crisis has been a Day One priority for President Trump,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox News Digital Monday morning when asked about the White House's message on affordability.
""Every Trump administration official has been playing their part over the past year to deliver on this priority, from slashing costly regulations to securing historic drug pricing deals — efforts that have cooled inflation and raised real wages,"" he continued. ""Much work remains, but President Trump is highlighting the meaningful progress that his Administration has made and will continue to make to turn Joe Biden’s economic disaster around.""
VANCE ACKNOWLEDGES VOTERS 'IMPATIENT' ON AFFORDABILITY, REJECTS 'TOTALLY BULLS--- NARRATIVE'
Voters have reported they are spooked by the current state of costs in the U.S.
Some 76% of voters, however, reported that they view theeconomynegatively, up from the 67% who reported the same in July, and the 70% who said the same at the end of Biden’s term, a November Fox News national survey found.
The survey found that voters overwhelmingly blamed Trump over Biden. About twice as many voters polled reported that Trump, rather than Biden, is responsible for the current economy, with three times as many voters reporting that Trump’s economic policies have hurt them, which is on par with their feelings during Biden's final year in office.
Andrew Bates, who served as the Biden White House's deputy press secretary, pointed to the voter survey when asked for response to the Trump administration's heightened comments, pinning blame for economic concerns on policies held over from the Biden White House.
""Democrats and the Biden-Harris Administration warned Trump against making the biggest health care cuts in history so billionaires could get tax breaks; just like they warned against the tariffs that are a record-level tax hike on working people,"" Bates said in an emailed comment to Fox News Digital. ""Maybe Donald Trump can't remember prices were lower last year. That's what I wondered when he started building himself an assisted living ballroom.""

The White House on Tuesday told Fox News Digital: ""The fact of the matter is that Joe Biden inflicted a generational economic crisis on the American people.
""Turning this crisis around has been a Day One priority for the Trump administration, which has already delivered cooledinflation, multi-year low gas prices, trillions in investments, and historic drug pricing deals to dramatically cut costs for American patients,"" White House spokesman Desai said. ""Biden flacks who insisted Biden was in absolute peak health and wasn’t dropping out of the 2024 presidential race just days before Biden did just that need to get a grip on reality.""
Trump continued in his Politico interview that he grades the current economy as ""A-plus.""
""I do want to talk about the economy, sir, here at home. And... and I wonder what grade you would give your economy,"" Politico asked Trump.
Trump: ""A-plus.""
Politico: ""A-plus?""
Trump responded: ""Yeah, A-plus-plus-plus-plus-plus.""
The Biden administration oversaw the highest inflation to rock the nation in 40 years, 30-year mortgage rates that rocketed to roughly 8%, up from under 3%, and the sharpest rise in interest rates in decades.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-mamdani-appointee-faces-heat-amid-promise-make-nyc-more-affordable,Top Mamdani appointee faces heat amid promise to make NYC more affordable: 'Embodiment of inflation',"Ronna McDaniel, former chair of the Republican National Committee, calls on Zohran Mamdani to fire transition co-chair Lina Khan, arguing she will undermine his claims to make NYC more affordable.
FIRST ON FOX:Four-term chairperson of the Republican National Committee (RNC), Ronna McDaniel, is calling out mayor-electZohran Mamdanifor hypocritically running a campaign focused on making New York City more affordable, arguing that his selection of a former Biden administration official, Lina Khan, as a top advisor will serve to undermine that.
McDaniel, tapped last week to lead the Competitiveness Coalition, a right-leaning nonprofit focused on advancing free market principles, penned a letter to Mamdani in one of her first major national moves since leaving the RNC. McDaniel called on the mayor-elect to fire Khan, President Joe Biden's former Federal Trade Commission (FTC) chair, who Mamdani appointed as co-chair of his transition team.
McDaniel said that if the NYC mayor-elect is really going to be true to his word about lowering costs for New Yorkers, he cannot have someone like Khan in his administration who ""is not only a flashback to the dreaded Biden days that 77 million Americans rejected by re-electing President Trump,"" but also holds a history of ""policy prescriptions [that] have failed before and will again.""

""He's saying one thing and doing another by putting her as the co-chair of his transition team,"" McDaniel told Fox News Digital. ""Lina Khan, for us, represents the embodiment of inflation in this country, and Bidenomics. I think she's the best example of somebody who raised prices across this country by fighting entrepreneurship, and innovation, and big business, and capitalism.""
During Khan's tenure as Biden's FTC chair, she garnered areputation as a fierce crusaderagainst big business. McDaniel's letter said that ""early reports"" from the business community in New York have indicated they are prepared for a ""rehash"" of the playbook Khan ran at the FTC under Biden.
One example cited in the letter was Khan's alleged opposition to a proposed merger between Amazon and the Massachusetts-based company iRobot, designer of the popular self-cleaning vacuum called Roomba. According to McDaniel's letter, Khan's opposition contributed to the company's subsequent bankruptcy, and resulted in 350 iRobot employees losing their jobs amid a 31% cut to the company's workforce. McDaniel also said in her letter that Khan sent taxpayer resources to regulators overseas in Europe ""in their quest to apply more red tape"" to American companies operating in theEuropean Union.

""Later in her term, reports even surfaced that Khan was communicating with Temu, a Chinese-owned company linked to the Chinese Communist Party, in an attempt to gather damaging information on American retailers,"" McDaniel wrote to Mamdani.  ""Surely we can agree that handicapping American innovators to benefit their CCP-linked rivals harms our geopolitical standing.""
Mamdani's appointment of Khan serves to illustrate that the mayor-elect doesn't care about inflation or ""what Bidenomics did to the people of New York and across the country,"" McDaniel added in an interview with Fox News Digital, noting that over-regulation by Mamdani is a real concern for her.
Businesses will flee New York City for places with better tax rates and less regulation that allow them to grow, do better and thrive, McDaniel argued.

""When you look at what Mamdani ran on, these things that sound good but in practice won't be good – rent control, government-run grocery stores, free bussing, raising the corporate tax rate … it sounds good, but it's not tenable and what it means is that businesses will say, 'Guess where I'm not going to do business in? New York City. I'm going to go to states that have better tax rates, that have less regulation, that will allow me to pay my employees and grow,"" McDaniel contended.
""That's whysocialismis sometimes confusing, especially for young voters,"" the former RNC chair added. ""All it means is an inefficient, loaded government that will cost more taxpayer money and will cost you more and leave less jobs in the long run.""

Americans' feelings of financial uncertainty come after Trump touted from the campaign trail that he would ""rapidly"" bring down prices upon his return to the Oval Office following Biden's tenure, while administration officials have said that the Trump economy under his second term is ""booming"" while taking ownership of economic wins.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick even claimed months ago that the Trump economy had taken hold after the Biden administration's spiraling inflation woes.
""The Trump Economy has officially arrived,"" Lutnick posted to X in July while pointing to the surge in the GDP and Trump's tariff policies.
""Biden’s first quarter is behind us, and growth is already accelerating,"" Lutnick posted to X. ""President Trump’s tariff policies have drawn historic investments and opened up global markets for U.S. businesses. Congratulations America: 3 percent today, and we’re just getting started.""

Trump is set to travel to Pennsylvania Tuesday, a key battleground state that helped deliver him his 2024 victory, to promote his administration's economic policies and growth amid voters reporting financial anxiety.

Trump's messaging on affordability itself has evolved in recent years, with his 2024 campaign promoting it would ""Make America Affordable Again,"" and the president later lamenting in November that ""affordability"" should be a message owned by Republicans, before also calling Democrats' messaging on affordability a ""con job"" earlier in December.
""You just say it. Affordability. I inherited the worst inflation in history. There was no affordability. Nobody could afford anything. The prices were massively high,"" Trump said during his December Cabinet meeting.
""But the word affordability is a con job by the Democrats,"" Trump continued.

LA GRANGE, TEXAS —Along the bends of Highway 71, a string of steadyTexastowns dot the wind-swept pastures. It’s here where most folks earn a living with their hands, wear dust on their boots, sun on their skin and easy smiles on their faces.
This is the soft edge of the Hill Country, where limestone gives way to red dirt and family ranches stitch the land together. Folks here haul their own hay, do things right the first time and don't wait for daylight to start the day.
Among those who know the grind is Cole Bolton, owner of K&C Cattle Company, who welcomes the Trump administration’s renewed focus on the razor-thin margins ranchers have endured for years.
""What the real issue is, is the price differential between the big four packers and what they're paying us for the product,"" Bolton told Fox News Digital.

Known as the ""big four,"" Tyson, JBS, Cargill and National Beef anchor the U.S. beef supply chain, commanding pricing power that reaches from pasture to plate.
Combined, the packing titans process about 85% of the grain-fattened cattle that become steaks, roasts and other supermarket cuts.
AMERICA’S SMALLEST CATTLE HERD IN 70 YEARS MEANS REBUILDING WILL TAKE YEARS AND BEEF PRICES COULD STAY HIGH
And those margins, Bolton said, have been squeezed for decades. ""Ranchers have dealt with such thin margins of profitability for the last 20 years.""

It’s the kind of sustained financial strain that federal officials say could signal deeper problems in the supply chain.
The revelation comes on the heels of PresidentDonald Trump'sexecutive order establishing food supply chain security task forces within the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to address risks from price fixing and anti-competitive behavior.
TRUMP'S BEEF IMPORT PLAN IGNORES KEY ISSUE SQUEEZING AMERICAN CATTLE RANCHERS
""My administration will act to determine whether anti-competitive behavior, especially by foreign-controlled companies, increases the cost of living for Americans and address any associated national security threat to food supply chains,"" Trump said in theorder released on Saturday.
According to the order, the attorney general and the FTC chairman may bring enforcement actions or propose new regulatory measures if the investigation uncovers anti-competitive behavior.

In a related move, the Trump administration called on the Justice Department toinvestigatethe major meatpacking companies, accusing them of driving up beef prices through ""illicit collusion, price fixing and price manipulation.""

BEEF PRICES ARE CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS — BUT AMERICANS AREN’T CUTTING BACK
Meanwhile, beef prices have climbed to record highs.
According to USDA data, the average price of beef in grocery stores climbed from about $8.40 per pound in March to $9.18 per pound by August 2025, a roughly 9% increase over that period. Despite that rise, beef demand continues to hit new highs.
But that strong appetite comes as ranchers are contending with the smallest U.S. cattle herd in 70 years.
Years of punishing drought, rising costs and an aging ranching workforce have thinned herds across the country. Ranchers and agricultural economists alike say rebuilding will take years, andbeef pricesaren’t likely to ease anytime soon.

He noted that the cattle industry has weathered one setback after another, from market turmoil to extreme conditions, over the past five years.

University faculty members have pointed to the political climate as one factor behind the allure of Southeastern Conference (SEC) schools, according to a report published Wednesday by theChronicle of Higher Education.
Joffery Gaymon,AuburnUniversity’svice president for enrollment management, told the Chronicle that ""SEC universities would, perhaps, like to think of themselves as apolitical."" Gaymon added that the institutions are a ""contrast to a 'noisy' world as part of its appeal.""
The Auburn faculty member said that, during the protests over the war in Gaza that rocked campuses across the country, ""We didn’t really have those same challenges.""
""When the world seems to be very noisy, there may be issues on campus, but it just shows up very differently for us. Some of those things really do matter to prospective students and families,"" he added.

STUDENTS EXPLAIN WHY MORE YOUNG AMERICANS ARE DITCHING NORTHEAST SCHOOLS FOR SOUTHERN CAMPUSES
The declining enrollment of Northeastern schools has recently made headlines by several outlets, including The Sunday Times and Wall Street Journal.According to The Sunday Times, many students are choosing SEC schools, including the University of South Carolina and the University of Tennessee, over Ivy League schools.
Fox News Digital reported last yearon Emerson College being forced to lay off staff and make spending cuts due to a projected enrollment decline. The budget woes came after colleges across the country were overwhelmed with student protests amid the Gaza conflict. Major schools like theUniversity of Michiganand Columbia University dealt with hostile environments during the protests.

Dominique J. Baker, an associate professor of education and public policy at the University of Delaware, ""believes the appeal of the SEC flagships aligns with the country’s right turn,"" the Chronicle reported.
""You see this sort of backlash and regression around civil liberties, civil rights, etc.,"" Baker said. Baker reportedly cited Texas A&M University's recent announcement of a policy limiting faculty discussion of gender and race.
UNIVERSITY PRESIDENTS ADMIT COLLEGES 'LOST THEIR MISSION' AS TRUMP PUSHES EDUCATION OVERHAUL
According to the Chronicle’s reporting, ""Some students and families may not think or care about such things, but ‘people’s imaginations about Southern public flagship institutions align with all those trends.’""
Robert Kelchen, a professor of educational leadership and policy studies at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, told the Chronicle that ""post-COVID, many students were looking for something different from college. With the closed-off vistas of online school and social distancing, many high school students sought ‘the stereotypical college experience.’""

The Chronicle reported that ""the undergraduates he teaches want a wide range of academic opportunities but also the broader social experiences that a large public university can provide.""
Although Kelchen is ""skeptical that politics plays a large role in college decisions,"" he cited recent research that showed students are willing to pay more than an additional $2,000 in tuition to attenda collegewhere fewer students disagree with them politically.
The study was conductedby Riley Acton, an assistant professor of economics at Miami University in Ohio.

The Chronicle piece also cited theSouth’s growing economy, warm weather, Greek life and sports entertainment as attractions for SEC schools.
""They’ve seen what’s happening to higher education in much of the Northeast and Midwest with cuts, and that’s not something that’s happening as much in the SEC,"" Kelchen says. ""We’re seeing growth. We’re seeing new buildings, bright and shiny things.""
In an interview with Fox News Digital, Adrian College President Jeffrey Docking discussed the growth of SEC schools. Docking, who has more than two decades of experience in higher education and iscredited with boosting Adrian College's enrollment, echoed Kelchen’s assessment, pointing to sports, entertainment and broader migration to the South as corporations and housing developments expand there.
""I think it’s hard to watch an Alabama football game at eight o’clock on a Saturday night and not think, ‘Wow, that’s the place to be,’"" Docking said. ""There’s a lot of marketing going on right now. I don’t think there’s any single reason, but the population is clearly migrating to the South — both within and beyond higher education.""

A new ranking by LawnStarter shows that many pockets of calm exist far from urban centers, which are ripe with stress and instability.
The studyanalyzed 500 cities on 42 metrics related to well-being, including sleep quality, mental health, commute times, access to nature, financial stability and recreation.

Suburban havens in midsize cities also topped the list, including Sunnyvale, California; Naperville, Illinois; and Carmel, Indiana.

Other cities faring poorly, such as Memphis and Cleveland, battle high crime, traffic fatalities and persistent poverty.

""But I think what the president’s saying is the idea that, 11 months into the administration, that we could solve all of the affordability problems created by Democrats — I mean, that’s the hoax.

EXCLUSIVE:The country's fourlargest public-sector unionsspent a combined $915 million on elections and progressive political activism during the 2024 election cycle, 86% of which came from member dues.
The Commonwealth Foundation, a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit promoting free-market policies, highlighted the massive political spending by the National Education Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) in a new report released this week.
The foundation published a similar report during the 2022 election cycle that found all four of these unionsspent $708 millionon progressive politics,
The report's findings, particularly that 86% of the unions' nearly $1 billion in political spending stems from membership dues, underscore criticism that these entities work more to push a political agenda than support their members.
FEDERAL PROBE DEMANDS CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION EXPLAIN MISSING FINANCIAL AUDITS SINCE 2020
""What they're doing when they're making these political investments is they're trying to get people into office that will raise taxes and increase the size and scope of government,"" public sector unions expert Aaron Withe told Fox News Digital. ""That's the way that it's been working for decades. That's why you see the government grows every single year. That's why you see taxes go up most every year as well.""
Withe, a critic of both public- and private-sector unions, said private-sector unions at least have an incentive structure based on a company's or industry's bottom line, but public-sector unions, Withe argued, are incentivized by raising taxes and growing government.
""When you look at union spending in politics, you have to remember that their goal — their primary purpose is a business — so they're there to grow revenue. They're there to gain more revenue than the year previously,"" Withe pointed out. ""The difference with the government union is that that revenue comes from public employees. And the way that you hire more public employees is by raising taxes on the private sector so that you can hire more bureaucrats.""
David Osborne, senior director of labor policy for the Commonwealth Foundation and co-author of the report, said ""the big question"" from his report is whether rank-and-file union members are aware of how their money is actually being spent.
""Years ago, [union members] could expect union executives to use dues to drive member services, including contract negotiations and grievance processing,"" Osborne said. ""Now, union members are unwittingly propping up left-leaning candidates and progressive causes like abortion, critical race theory and defunding the police.""

According to the Commonwealth Foundation's report, the findings show that approximately 25% of the group's total spending — or $642 million — goes toward ""representational activities,"" which the report describes as ""the spending category most closely tied to membership support."" Meanwhile, the unions also spent about a combined 33% of their total spending — or $845 million — on general overhead, union administration, staff benefits and other cost categories ""linked to basic operations.""
But spending on elections and progressive political activism surpassed both those categories. Collectively, the unions spent around $755 million on federal elections and national progressive politics, while their state-level affiliates combined to spend another $160 million on state races and ideological causes. Of that spending, $650 million, or 86%, originated from union membership dues, according to the Commonwealth Foundation.
The report notes the unions also collect voluntary political action committee (PAC) deductions from members and their families, which allows the unions to collect money that can then godirectly to candidates,something that is not supposed to be done with members' dues money. The union's federal PAC spending accounted for 14% of the group's political spending, according to the report.

""Government unions’ heavy use of membership dues money for politics — more than what they collectively spent on representational activities — underlines a disturbing trend: the growing, overt reliance by union officials to spend member dues rather than political action committee funds on their political and ideological agendas,"" the Commonwealth Foundation says in its new report.
""Yet, much of this spending is possible only because of the lack of accountability and control over what powerful union executives do with members’ dues. Union dues, not the separately collected PAC funds, are the overwhelming power behind — 86 percent — of union political spending.
""Few members are aware that union leaders launder much of their dues through super PACs and 527s to back political projects. Even fewer members can effect change within their union to stop it.""

""In some places, compounding layers of regulation, local fees, rigid pay rules and government insurance mandates, have pushed rideshare prices well above what they are in cities with comparable costs of living,"" Blinick said.

Uber argues that unless cities rethink the regulatory layers driving up prices, more markets could soon follow Seattle’s path, where riders pay more, drivers earn less and the system itself becomes harder to sustain.

It just keeps happening.
On Nov. 24,California newlyweds were allegedly killedby an illegal immigrant truck driver who obtained a commercial driver's license under Gov.Gavin Newsom’s lax, horrifying and dangerous policies.
William Carter and his new bride, Jennifer Lower, died after slamming into a jackknifed big rig, driven byillegal migrantRajinder Kumar, who managed to obtain his CDL while in the country illegally, which is exactly as crazy as it sounds.
This follows similar incidents involving individuals, with no right to even be in the U.S., mowing down Americans in commercial trucks. Three died in August, three more in October, and now this couple, just starting their lives together, have been killed as a result of Newsom and his fellow progressives’ fecklessness.

As the holder of a New York state CDL, I can tell you that for me, the process to get it took documents in triplicate, endless paperwork and a doctor’s visit. Yet, somehow, illegal immigrants who can’t even read street signs, much less English, go to one-stop ""driving schools"" and emerge with the precious document.
And let us understand exactly whata CDLis: It is a license to operate by far the most deadly vehicles on our highways, 25,000 pounds of steel and glass that can turn a road trip into a tragedy in an instant.
NOEM WARNS 18-WHEELERS BECOMING ‘WEAPONS’ AS NEWSOM, SANCTUARY STATES LICENSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Not only do the illegals draw a lower wage, there is no worker's compensation insurance to pay for, something which in the context of a legal business would have progressives calling the owners capitalist pigs who need to be punished.
It doesn’t just feel like there are two sets of rules here, it feels like American citizens have one set of overly onerous rules, and illegal immigrants have no rules whatsoever. In fact, according to Democrats, unless they are violent criminals, they can’t even be deported, which is flat-out nuts.

Americans are getting fed up. Under PresidentJoe Biden, we saw millions of illegals pour in and be given cellphones, hotel rooms and even straight-up cash. How many citizens during that time couldn’t pay their cellphone bill, afford sky-high hotel prices or even cover basic needs?

Meanwhile, it is the same progressives who cripple legal enterprises with high taxes, $30 minimum wages and absurd environmental regulations who turn a blind eye when illegal immigrants flaunt every rule, from selling knockoff handbags on the street to killing people on our highways.

Much of the current conversation around immigration, legal and otherwise, has recently centered on the question of assimilation. But assimilation is not just learning English, being conversant in baseball and knowing our nation’s history. It also means playing by a shared set of rules, something the far left seems to have no interest in.
NEWSOM'S SANCTUARY POLICIES UNDER FIRE AFTER DRUNK ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT KILLS ELDERLY MAN
The cold, hard fact: Call it Biden’s last laugh, if you will, is that no matter how much White House advisor Stephen Miller righteously insists upon it, it is not possible todeport 20 million people. It is, however, possible to make them play by the rules. And that, all by itself, could lead to many self-deportations.
Nothing can replace the lives that have been lost because progressives decided to give illegals a free pass when it comes to obtaining CDLs, but nobody else has to die as a result of this naive corruption.

Shut down the illegal driving schools, shut down the illegal labor markets, check the status of every nanny from Park Slope to Silicon Valley. Put simply, at least make illegals jump through the same hoops that citizens must.
If we do that, then maybe these tragic deaths really will stop happening.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/miami-mayoral-candidate-reveals-how-he-will-flip-script-dem-rivals-strategy,Miami mayoral candidate reveals how he will flip script on Dem rival's 'city of renters' strategy,"Miami Republican mayoral candidate Emilio Gonzalez shares his plan to counter the rise of socialist city leaders and make the city affordable again.
EXCLUSIVE:Miami Republican mayoral candidateEmilio Gonzalez is accusing his progressive Democratic opponent Eileen Higgins of wanting to ""create a city of renters"" despite pushing a message of affordability. Instead, he is proposing a plan to turn Miami into a ""city of owners.""
Gonzalez and Higgins will face off in a runoff election on Dec. 9 after none of the candidates reached 50% of the vote on election night on Nov. 4. Higgins won 35.96% of the vote while Gonzalez took home 19.47%.
Higgins, a Miami-Dade County commissioner who resigned her office to run for mayor, has emphasized ""building an affordable and prosperous future."" She has touted her successes as county commissioner in investing nearly $3 million in small business grants and investments in building nearly 7,000 affordable housing units.
However, in an interview with Fox News Digital, Gonzalez, who is an Army veteran, former West Point teacher and business leader, warned that while Higgins has emphasized affordability in her campaign, her policies would stunt the American dream and keep citizens in perpetual renter status.

Ron DeSantis-backed Republican candidate Emilio Gonzalez advanced to a runoff Dec. 9 that will determine Miami’s next mayor after no candidate received 50% of votes.(Matias J. Ocner/Miami Herald/Tribune News Service via Getty Images; Rebecca Blackwell; The Associated Press)
Gonzalez has been endorsed by PresidentDonald Trump, Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.
""She can point to some votes on a county commission to help put up a building here or a building there. But it really doesn't move the needle,"" Gonzalez told Fox News Digital. ""The affordability issue, it sounds very nice, but it means absolutely nothing because she really hasn't done much when it comes to affordability.""
""Right now, Miami is so expensive. Nothing is affordable,"" he continued. ""We're in a situation where our young people, once they graduate from college, they have to leave because the jobs here don't pay enough. The apartments cost too much. Forget about a mortgage. There's nothing in Miami that sells for less than five, six hundred thousand dollars right now. And the jobs will not support that.""
Meanwhile, he went after Higgins for talking up her belief in affordability while he said, ""She wants to create a city of renters.""
""I, on the other hand, want to create a city of owners. I want property owners,"" he said. ""They want to talk about affordability, everybody does. They want to talk about the challenges of public transportation, everybody does. But it comes down to what is the solution, and that's where I think we differ.""

""We have vastly different views on how to move the city forward and what's best for our residents. She believes in a very statist approach where the government needs to go out and help people build, build, build, build, build, and never to own, but just to rent,"" he said. ""And I'm about making sure that our residents have enough money in their pocket so that they can afford to buy a home and buy that first a condominium or buy that starter home.""
""The last thing I'm going to do is allow Miami to fall into the same trap that you've seen… inNew Yorkor Chicago, which is bankrupt, or L.A., which is quite frankly, looks like a wasteland in the downtown area. That's not going to happen in Miami, it's not.""
He praisedDeSantisfor advancing an agenda of eliminating property taxes in Florida, a policy he said he would implement if elected Miami mayor.
""I applaud Gov. DeSantis wanting to do away with property taxes. We can do that. And we can do that and not skip a beat,"" he said. ""Right now, property taxes make up less than 7% of the city's budget. You know what? I think we can find 7% in efficiencies to offset that.""
""That's just the beginning,"" he went on, adding, ""I think there are other opportunities that we have to put money in people's pockets through efficiencies, through leveraging our resources and making this place affordable again.""

Despite Higgins’ election night lead, Gonzalez said he is optimistic about his chances of success.
""This is a generational election,"" he said. ""It’s not going to be an easy race. It'll be a tight race. It's probably going to be maybe a five-point race. But we're not letting up at all. We refuse to give up our future.""

Pointing to other U.S. cities, such as New York City, and countries like Cuba, that have embraced socialist policies, Gonzalez said, ""The residents of Miami, the vast majority of whom came from socialist countries where socialists took over and destroyed their cities and their homes and their families, they don't want that here.""
""We see what's happened in other cities in the U.S. and… they do not want that here. And I am their candidate, and I'm going to make sure that that doesn't happen here, even though it's happened in other places in Latin America and in the United States.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Higgins’ campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
The winner of the runoff election will replace Republican Mayor Francis Suarez, who is term-limited.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admins-energy-agenda-hailed-for-crucial-wins-green-activists-lash-out,Trump admin's energy agenda hailed for crucial 'wins' as green activists lash out,"Energy economist Mark Wolfe joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss high electricity prices, what families can do to make their home more energy efficient and the importance of making energy more affordable.
FIRST ON FOX:A coalition of conservative groups representing theenergy industryis hailing a list of 10 regulatory and fiscal ""wins"" under the Trump administration's new Energy Secretary Chris Wright, which they say have ""restored America's path toward true energy dominance.""
""Secretary Chris Wright has delivered the boldest course correction in modern energy policy, and the results speak for themselves. He has led the largest deregulatory initiative in Department of Energy history, cut billions in wasteful green subsidies, and restored a clear path to American energy dominance,"" Jason Isaac, CEO of one of the groups that signed on to the published list of Trump administration energy sector wins, wrote.
""He halted dozens of harmful appliance rules, streamlined NEPA, canceled politically driven wind, solar, and carbon-capture spending, reignited U.S. LNG and nuclear development, and used emergency authority to keep critical coal capacity online, so the grid stays stable when it matters most,"" he continued. ""This is what it looks like when Washington finally puts consumers, reliability, and American workers first.""
TRUMP ADMIN ANNOUNCES BIG STEP TOWARD ‘ENERGY DOMINANCE’ WITH MASSIVE ALASKA LNG PROJECT ALLIANCE

Groups from the letter include the Heartland Institute, the Energy and Environmental Legal Institute, Truth In Energy and Climate, the American Energy Institute and others.
Several of the ""wins"" they touted focused on deregulation, such as the rescission or blocking of 47 specific regulations and standards for a variety of consumer appliances, reforms to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) aimed at reducing permitting delays for energy infrastructure, the cancellation of ""billions of dollars"" in funding for wind and solar projects, the fast-tracking of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects that the coalition says were ""stymied"" under the Biden administration and an initiative to critically review the impact of greenhouse gasses on the U.S. climate, among a list of other reforms.
However, environmental groups who spoke to Fox News Digital about the conservative coalition's victory lap argued the recent reforms actually serve to help big businesses and not the average person. They noted that the viewpoint that PresidentDonald Trump'senvironmental agenda is making the country stronger is also a facade.
""These policies might be good for Trump and Wright's rich corporate buddies, but they are downright evil for working people,"" Tim Donaghy, Greenpeace USA's research director, told Fox News Digital. ""The decisions made in the last nine months are literally sucking money out of Americans' wallets and putting it into oil industry bank accounts, while pretending they're making the country stronger.""
Donaghy said that President Trump's plan to increase energy exports, for example, ""will increase"" costs for American families and exacerbate climate change, which he argued was another driver of increased housing insurance costs for families.
CCP-LINKED FIRMS QUIETLY HOLD STAKES IN US SOLAR COMPANIES FUELING DEM'S GREEN PUSH
""The sad thing is that the Trump administration's policies are creating more pollution that will make Americans sick. Every year, 350,000 Americans die younger from being exposed to toxic air pollution from burning fossil fuels. We need that number to go down. These ‘wins’ all but guarantee it will go up,"" Donaghy concluded.
The ""wins"" touted by the ""American Energy Dominance Coalition"" did not exclusively include deregulation efforts in theenergy sector,but also featured increased investments in nuclear energy production. The list also praised Secretary Wright for launching a critical review earlier this summer looking into the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions on the U.S. climate, as well as a study focused on identifying pipeline needs and potential permitting reforms that could be used to help speed up oil and gas production.
Some of the additional deregulation ""wins"" listed by the coalition include the termination of $3.7 billion in carbon-capture and decarbonization grants, the cancellation of ""hundreds-of-millions"" in electric-vehicle and battery manufacturing grants and a push towards rescinding energy-efficiency standards for federal billions, which the conservative coalition argued could lead to saving millions of dollars in ""unnecessary upgrades.""
""Chris Wright has done an amazing job of actually prioritizing American energy development and affordability rather than globalist misguided climate agendas,"" Heartland Institute President James Taylor said. ""American energy policy must continue to bolster affordable and reliable domestic energy sources rather than the agendas of foreign nations that are often hostile to American interests.""
Meanwhile, Sal Nuzzo, executive director of Consumers Defense, also praised Secretary Wright and his administration's ""most sweeping de-regulatory initiative in U.S. history,"" for overturning ""burdensome regulations"" that Nuzzo says hurt both consumers and businesses.
Nuzzo also pointed out that the Trump administration has taken a stand against ""politically motivated"" environmental, social, governance (ESG) ""schemes,"" which he said have been inflating energy costs and weakening U.S. independence while also undermining the free market system.
But the Environmental Working Group's (EWG) Bernadette Del Chiaro, who is EWG's senior vice president for its California-based operations, dismissed that the policy ""wins"" touted by these conservative groups were actually ""wins"" for the American people. Instead, Del Chiaro described them as ""giveaways"" to the fossil fuel industry that will result in greater pollution, higher energy costs, and fewer choices for consumers.

""Slashing support for wind and solar cripples U.S. leadership in the rapidly expanding clean-energy economy. These rollbacks kill jobs, strand private investment, and hand global economic advantage to China just as the rest of the world races toward cheaper, cleaner and more competitive energy sources,"" Del Chiaro told Fox News Digital.
""If the priority is affordability, the Administration is on the wrong track as there’s no cheaper energy resource than solar,"" she added. ""And if beefing upAmerican energyindependence is the goal, once again, we are veering off course because there is nothing more abundant than the sunshine that falls on our country ‘from sea to shining sea,’ or more homegrown than the wind that whips across our Great Plains.""",12/3/2025

One of the most prestigious scholarly associations in the U.S. has barred former Harvard President Larry Summers for life, appearing to condemn him over his ties to late disgraced financierJeffrey Epstein.
The American Economic Association (AEA), which counts among its members some of the nation’s leading academics, government officials and business executives,announced the actionTuesday on its website.
""The American Economic Association (AEA) has accepted Lawrence H. Summers' voluntary resignation from membership and, pursuant to the AEA's Policies, Procedures, and Code of Professional Conduct, has imposed alifetime banon his membership,"" the statement said.
""In addition, effective immediately, the AEA has imposed a lifetime prohibition on Mr. Summers' attending, speaking at, or otherwise participating in AEA-sponsored events or activities, including serving in any editorial or refereeing capacity for AEA journals.""

""The AEA condemns Mr. Summers' conduct, as reflected in publicly reported communications, as fundamentally inconsistent with its standards of professional integrity and with the trust placed in mentors within the economics profession,"" the statement said.
The association’s decision follows the release ofemails showing Summers’ close relationshipwith Epstein.
Harvard has facedits own scrutiny over its long-running ties to Epstein, including donations he made to the Ivy League college and his visits to campus.
Summers, who served as Harvard’s president from 2001 to 2006, has previously been criticized for maintaining contact with Epstein even after the financier’s 2008 conviction.

The fallout surrounding the emails sawSummers step downfrom several public and advisory roles, including positions at OpenAI, the Center for American Progress and the Yale Budget Lab.
The pressure increased further after astudent-recorded videoof Summers addressing questions about his ties to Epstein went viral.

Gen. Jack Keane weighs in on President Donald Trump’s push for regime change in Venezuela amid his drug crackdown on ‘The Story.’
President Maduro’s appeal to oil-rich nations Sunday laid bare just how isolated he has become, a Latin American oil expert says, before describing Venezuela as ""broke"" and drowning in $150 billion of debt.
The Venezuelan dictator's plea came in a letter in which he appealed to OPEC for support, claiming thatU.S. ""direct aggression""was undermining Venezuela’s energy sector and threatening global oil stability.
In a letter toOPEC Secretary-GeneralHaitham Al Ghais and published by Venezuelan Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, Maduro wrote, ""I hope to count on your best efforts to help stop this aggression, which is growing stronger and seriously threatens the balance of the international energy market, both for producing and consuming countries.""

""OPEC is unlikely to get involved,""Francisco J. Monaldi,Latin American Energy Policy Director, told Fox News Digital.
""Saudi Arabiais the key player, and they will not want to confront the Trump Administration. But more importantly, they never get involved in this kind of conflict,"" he added.
In his plea, Maduro argued that U.S. actions were designed to ""destabilize"" Venezuela and urged oil-producing nations to show solidarity.
The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela targeting government officials, state-run industries like oil and mining, and financial transactions in response to concerns over corruption, trafficking and human-rights abuses.

His request followed President Trump’s order to closeU.S. airspace over Venezuela, a move that tightened Washington’s pressure campaign and further restricted the regime’s ability to carry out international business.
Yet Monaldi stressed that Maduro knows his appeal was only symbolic and had ""framed"" the situation to suit his own narrative over oil.
""Maduro knows perfectly well that he is not going to get the reaction that he would want, but is framing the conflict as a conflict about oil,"" he argued.
""Venezuela could once again become amajor oil producerand produce about 4 million barrels a day in less than a decade, significantly quadrupling their current output.

""The country could increase production if the oil sector is opened fully to private foreign investment, and that requiresregime change.
Four million barrels of oil per day will be the equivalent of about $90 billion per year in revenues, which is similar to what Venezuela received in the best of times.
The income could allow Venezuela to pay the debt back and recover swiftly, micro, economically, although it will take years to get to that figure.""

TRUMP FLIPS DEMS' 'AFFORDABILITY' SCRIPT, TURNING BUZZWORD INTO MAGA MATERIAL AS MAMDANI VISIT LOOMS
Several leading Democrats, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumer, D-N.Y., have increasingly centered their message on affordability in recent months, even pointing to the issue as a decisive factor in last month's Democratic victories across the country.
""Republicans have failed the American people on the economy. The cost of living in the United States of America is completely and totally out of control,""Jeffries saidduring a news conference last month. ""Republicans promised to lower the high cost of living on day one. Costs have not gone down, they’ve gone up.""
Jeffries' remarks came one day after Schumer made similar comments about whatSenate Democratscalled the ""Republican Affordability Crisis."" He said that affordability was ""the most important issue keeping Americans up at night"" and that Trump and Republicans made it worse.
""Donald Trump may think affordability is some kind of Democratic 'con job,' as he recently called it, but the opposite is true. Americans are fed up with high costs, and they need a lifeline, while Donald Trump is tossing them an anchor,""Schumer said.

Mamdani's campaign was focused on affordability in the city.

Affordability was the top campaign platform for the handful of high-profile elections held last month during the off-year cycle. Democrats emerged from the 2025 election cycle victorious, including socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani notching a win to become the next mayor of New York City, as well as Democrats winning the only two gubernatorial elections this year, which were held in Virginia and New Jersey.
In New Jersey, voters reported that the state's notoriously high taxes and theeconomywere their top issues heading into the polling stations, according to Fox News Voter Poll data last month. In Virginia, half of voters reported that the economy was their top issue, more than double the number who reported healthcare as their top concern, according to Fox polling data.
In New York City, affordability was by far voters' top concern in the notoriously expensive Big Apple, according to previous Fox News Voter Poll data.
This week, left-wing Democrats and Republicans are in a fierce battle to win a congressional seat in Tennessee where the Democratic nominee, known as the ""AOC of Tennessee,"" is building support among voters in the deep red state.
Trump railed during the Cabinet meeting that his administration is lowering prices for citizens after inheriting ""the worst inflation in history"" under the Biden administration, including by making massive deals with foreign industries to create jobs in the U.S. and his tariff policies that aim to bring parity to the U.S.' chronic trade deficit with foreign countries.
""Our prices now for energy, but for gasoline, are really low. Electricity is coming down. And when that comes down, everything comes down. But the word affordability is a Democrat scam. They say it and then they go into the next subject and everyone thinks, ‘Oh, they had lower prices.’ No, they had the worst inflation in the history of our country,"" Trump continued.
InTennessee, Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and other high-profile Republicans have made a mad dash to rally support for Trump-backed congressional candidateMatt Van Eppsas he faces off against Democratic Tennessee state Rep.Aftyn Behn,who has been compared to socialist politicians, including Mamdani and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

The Tennessee race is a special election to fill Republican Rep. Mark Green's seat in the 7th Congressional District following his resignation from Congress in July. Republicans have previously easily won the seat in the deep red state, but recent left-wing wins during November's elections built Democratic momentum to flip the seat blue.
Johnson headlined rallies in the state for Van Epps and Trump called into rallies, as well as posted social media messages promoting that Tennessee voters reject the Democrat candidate.
""The whole world is watching Tennessee right now, and they're watching the district,"" Trump said during one call.

""Angry about high grocery prices? Worried about health care costs? Feeling burned by tariffs? Then Dec. 2 is your day to shake up Washington,"" she said in her campaign's final ad.
""That struggling to afford groceries, healthcare, and rent is the life we have to accept,"" Behn wrote in a Substack post in November. ""We have the opportunity through this election to tell those in power that we’re done begging for crumbs, we’re done being sold out, and we’ve had it with the cost of living and the chaos.""

Meanwhile, Democrats such as Ocasio-Cortez and former Vice President Al Gore have backed Behn's campaign, making Tennessee an unlikely epicenter for another campaign showdown that pits a left-wing candidate promoting affordability against a Republican.

When asked about Democrats' affordability messaging and if Trump's messaging is falling flat with voters considering the Tennessee race, the White House argued Democrats don't have ""have a leg to stand on when it comes to affordability.""
""The idea that Democrats, who spent four years during the Biden presidency creating the worse inflation crisis in a generation, have a leg to stand on when it comes to affordability is beyond laughable. Americans remember how President Trump’s agenda created historic job, wage, and economic growth during his first term, and Americans know that this same agenda is again restoring working-class prosperity in President Trump’s second term,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai told Fox Digital.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/construction-labor-crunch-drives-up-costs-deepens-americas-housing-affordability-crisis,Construction labor crunch drives up costs and deepens America’s housing affordability crisis,"Jim Tobin, president and chief executive officer of the National Association of Home Builders, says easing rents offer a temporary alternative to high home prices, though buying remains the most reliable path to building wealth.
As home prices climb and inventory thins, a major culprit is hiding in plain sight: the U.S. simply doesn’t have enough skilled labor force to build the homes buyers want and need.
Experts say this labor shortage is now constraining the entire housing pipeline. Projects are taking longer to complete, construction costs continue to rise, and first-time home buyers are being squeezed out of an already competitive market.
THE PRICE OF BUILDING A HOME KEEPS CLIMBING — AND UNCERTAINTY ISN’T HELPING
Every month, the construction industry is short around 350,000 workers.
What's more, the National Association of Home Builders estimates the industry will need to hire nearly 723,000 workers per year just to keep pace with demand and close a nationwide housing gap of 1.5 million homes.
Home Builders Institute President and CEO Ed Brady told Fox News Digital the skilled labor shortage in the U.S. is ""severe"" and driven largely by ""an aging workforce, fewer young entrants into the trades and decades of underinvestment in vocational training.""
""This shortage adds nearly two extra months to building timelines, inflating costs and delaying delivery,"" Brady said.
A joint study by the Home Builders Institute and the University of Denver found that in 2024 alone, the labor shortfall resulted in 19,000 fewer homes built and an annual economic hit of $10.8 billion from higher carrying costs and lost production.
THE TOP 3 REASONS HOUSING HAS BECOME SO UNAFFORDABLE IN THE US MARKET

Joseph Kane, a fellow at Brookings Metro, said the shortage of skilled workers extends far beyond home building.
""Workforce development is not just a nice-to-do, but a must-do across the built environment. For housing, buildings, and other infrastructure systems (e.g. roads, water systems, etc.), it is crucial and mission-critical for employers to have a durable and dependable pipeline of talent,"" Kane said.
""Without this pipeline, employers are competing against each other for scarce talent, projects can run into delays, and additional uncertainties and costs may mount over time,"" added Kane, who studies the intersection between infrastructure and economic development.
The revelation comes as the U.S. grapples with a slew ofhousing challengesthat, brick by brick and regulation by regulation, have helped contribute to today’s crisis.
TRUMP'S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE MAY BURDEN AMERICANS WITH MORE DEBT, EXPERTS SAY
Experts point to three major forces doing the most damage: restrictive zoning, land-use barriers and financial policies that have choked supply and pushed prices out of reach.

Jim Tobin, president and CEO of the National Association of Home Builders, said the cost ofregulationsalone plays a massive role in housing affordability.
""Regulatory burdens really do add up on the unaffordability index,"" Tobin told Fox News Digital.
""We estimate that 24% of the cost of a single-family home is embedded in regulations at all three levels of local, state and federal government. That comes out to roughly $94,000 in regulatory costs.""
Experts say rules and red tape are choking supply and driving up home prices across America.(Matthew Busch/Bloomberg/Getty Images)
Experts say the quickest path to easing the housing crunch is lowering interest rates and peeling back regulations that have stifled new construction. But without enough workers, they warn, even a more favorable policy environment won’t translate into the surge of new supply the market needs.
""Looking ahead, even as interest rates ease, labor constraints will remain a key bottleneck, meaning slower housing starts, elevated prices and continued affordability challenges in 2026 unless workforce development and skilled trades training accelerates,"" Brady added.

Kane said the labor crunch is intensifying alongside rising material costs and broader economic headwinds.
""Having enough skilled workers is one of many considerations facing home builders and other developers in the coming year. The lack of certainty on this front is only adding to the uncertainties in the country's built environment, which can result in project delays, slower growth in new housing stock and downstream impacts on household affordability,"" Kane said.

To live in 2025 is a blessing. But it is also a strange time to be alive, particularly when it comes to wealth.
When you think about wealth and what it does for someone and their quality of life, there are a few ways to view it. Certainly wealth ""buys"" freedom and flexibility, which is arguably the most important role of wealth.
But, at a micro level, measuring wealth for many Americans is about day-to-dayquality of life. On one hand, wealth should grant access to wants — goods and services above and beyond your day-to-day needs.
WHY GEN Z DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE KIDS
Wealth is also supposed to be a shield against the stresses tied up with money, reducing worry over covering basic needs and feeling like you have financial breathing room from day to day and month to month.
Today in America, at a practical level, we live with awealth paradox.
We have access to luxuries that people of hundreds of years ago couldn’t have dreamed.
We have access to ground-breaking medicines and lifesaving procedures. We have technology, including portable tech that we can carry in our pockets, with access to just about all the information ever created. We have creation tools as well.
We have cars with incredible functionality (probably too much, in my opinion). We are able to jet across the country or even around the world. Many of us have closets full of clothing, shoes and accessories. Our grocery stores are filled with food, aisles lined with overwhelming choices.
We are living witheveryday luxuriesthat, if you step back, are in many ways hard to believe.
So, while we can access wants, much of the working and middle class still live with the stress of affording basic costs of living.
Housing is difficult and expensive to come by. Even if one can afford a house and interest payments, the carrying costs, including property taxes and insurance, as well as maintenance, eat up a larger percentage of wages.
Healthcare costs, particularly for those who don’t have corporate employer-sponsored health benefits, are skyrocketing. Just the insurance portion alone, separate from any care costs paid out of pocket, is a heavy burden on families.
Education, particularly higher education, is also a stressor, saddling young people with five or even six figures’ worth of debt, while in many cases not providing an appropriate return on investment.
And while we have an abundance of food, Americans’ dollars buy less. Even eating in restaurants at every level, from fast food to sit-down dining, has exploded in cost.
Yes, in 2025, the working and middle class may haveaccess to more, but the stress of basic living has increased exponentially. And that makes it harder to feel ""wealthy.""
Are we truly wealthy, as individuals and as a nation, if a key tenet of wealth, that shield from financial stress, has been pierced?
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
If we look at the culprits, from housing to healthcare to education, all are areas where the government (and government-adjacent policy) has increased costs. It is up to them to start removing barriers and making Americans truly wealthy again.
Moreover, the Fed’s policies, including around 15 years of zero and near-zero interest rate policy, quantitative easing, suppressed real rates, and then whipsaw tightening, structurally created a world where asset owners have seen their wealth increase and those without assets fell behind. This has underscored today’s wealth paradox: Americans enjoy luxury consumption but can’t afford the ""entry ticket"" to wealth because the cost of the foundational asset — that is, a home — has been financialized far beyond incomes.
A healthy economy needs to be balanced with a healthy society, and you can’t have that if individuals don’t have peace of mind. Financial stress is cited as a reason in almost one out of every four divorces. It correlates with anxiety, depression and physical health issues.

Of course, some of that is self-inflicted, but looking at thepercentage of incomethat basic needs are accounting for today, something is wrong.
Our wealth paradox is one that can be solved with action. We need real reform on getting the government to stop sucking up the wealth of hardworking Americans. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness hangs in the balance.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-rick-scott-i-grew-up-public-housing-i-know-how-fix-obamacare,SEN RICK SCOTT: I grew up in public housing and I know how to fix Obamacare,"Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., criticizes the Affordable Care Act for what she says are higher costs and explains when and why she thinks Americans will see economic relief on ‘Fox Report.’
It’s time for all of us to admit what the American people already know: Obamacare has failed.
TheAffordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, created a system that enriched insurance companies and hospitals and screwed over Americans. Obamacare didn’t let people keep their insurance plans or their doctors, and families didn’t save money — and neither did the federal government. Families have been left with higher costs and healthcare that doesn’t meet their needs.
I want to tell you about a family with a preexisting health condition that I think about whenever I talk about healthcare in our country. They grew up in public housing, rarely saw a doctor. One of the kids had a hip disease. Their mom would drive 200 miles to a charity hospital to get him treatment. That was my family growing up.
When I hear stories offamilies struggling to afford their premiums, putting off treatment because it’s too expensive, or splitting their pills in half to make them last longer, I see my mother and my brother and the struggle my family went through. And I see a system that has continued to fail families like mine while ruining the market for everyone else.
LONGTIME OBAMACARE CRITIC SAYS TRUMP PLAN WON'T SOLVE PROGRAM'S FATAL FLAWS
Obamacare isn't affordable for many Americans, so it needs to be fixed in Congress.(Cyberguy.com)
Republicans, and even Democrats, agree:Obamacare hasn’t made healthcare any more affordable. I want people to be able to get affordable, accessible healthcare and keep the safety net for families that Obamacare is intended to be, which means we have to take action.
I know we can fix Obamacare. I have been working with PresidentDonald Trumpand my colleagues on a bill that makes simple fixes to Obamacare that will help families get healthcare that fits their needs, all while driving down costs. Under my plan, we don’t replace Obamacare — it doesn’t go anywhere. We keep healthcare.gov and state exchanges, we maintain protections for individuals with preexisting conditions, and nobody will lose healthcare.
We simply add options and let Americans be consumers, making the choice that works best for them and their families. That means we stop funneling tax dollars to insurance companies, allow people toshop across state linesand make healthcare more transparent so families can make informed decisions.
TRUMP’S ‘NEW’ HEALTHCARE IDEA IS A PAINFUL PRESCRIPTION FOR WORKING AMERICANS
Right now, families can only buy insurance plans that are sold in the state they live in. That doesn’t make any sense. If an insurance provider in Kansas offers a great plan, a family in Georgia should be able to buy it. By letting the states opt in to a system that allows sales across state lines, we are opening up thehealth insurance marketacross the country, which encourages innovation and competition to drive down prices and create better choices for families.
Just like shopping for clothes or groceries, you’re no longer limited to the stores in your town; you have access to stores states away to find what you want instead of settling for what’s right in front of you. And again, we can and must do this while maintaining protections for those with preexisting conditions so that everyone is treated fairly.

When we stop funneling tax dollars for subsidies to insurance companies and instead provide families safety-net support through a Trump Health Freedom Account — an HSA-style account — we put the power of decision-making into the hands of families to choose a plan that best fits their needs.  Americans will alwaysmake a better choice for their families than the government will.
And then we add transparency to healthcare by requiring public reporting of negotiated rates, costs, and cash prices for services provided at hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, imaging centers and clinical labs. Families will have upfront pricing on what things will cost them — a healthcare menu — so they can make informed decisions and plan for their needs.

We simply add options and let Americans be consumers, making the choice that works best for them and their families.
We have the opportunity to make simple changes that make a world of difference to American families. We’d flip the script on Obamacare that left Americans with fewer choices, higher costs and worse outcomes, to one that drives down costs, fits their needs and encourages transparency and better outcomes.  We have to get rid of the old ways Obamacare was failing and transform it into a new, open program that gives Americans the ability to act like consumers, just like we do with every other thing we buy.
Everyone knows Obamacare is a disaster. It’s time to fix it. We must stop politicians in Washington from making our healthcare decisions top-down and instead give Americans an open healthcare system where they have the freedom to get the care they need.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/solution-housing-affordability-problem-marriage,A solution to the housing affordability problem: Marriage,"Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway and former Democratic Pennsylvania congressman Patrick Murphy discuss the White House’s focus on affordability ahead of Thanksgiving on ‘The Story with Martha MacCallum.’
A key aspect of the suddenly trendy ""affordability"" problem is that young adults are said to be priced out of thehousing market. The statistics appear to be compelling. Per the National Association of Realtors, ""Today's young adults continue to face delays in homeownership compared to past generations at the same age. Not only is the homeownership rate lower for those under 35 today compared to past generations, but the first-time buyer share is lower, and the age of first-time buyers is older than seen historically.""
The most obvious approach to helping Gen Zers buy homes is to lower costs by increasing available supply. To be sure, this supply-side solution has its place. But here’s something else to consider: marriage.
It’s no coincidence that high housing costs coincide with another socioeconomic trend:low marriage rates. Per the Institute of Family Studies, ""only about 60% of 35-year-old men are ever married today, down from 90% in 1980."" And, ""just 20% of 25-year-old women and 23% of 25-year-old men have ever married today. These are close to the lowest levels ever observed for marriage rates.""
The decline in marriage has several important implications for housing costs.
TRUMP’S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE JUST INTRODUCES A NEW KIND OF DEBT
One way to defeat the affordability crunch is the most traditional way — marriage.(iStock)
The most obvious, of course, is the fact that two incomes are better than one when it comes to saving for a down payment andpaying monthly mortgage costs. Affordability that arises from pooling income — and aspirations — reflects an assumption about marriage that has faded.
Brad Wilcox of the Institute of Family Studies calls it ""cornerstone marriage"" — the idea of starting out poor and working together to improve a shared lot. He distinguishes between that and ""capstone marriage"" — wedding once one (or two) have become affluent enough to afford a destination wedding and a house. In other words, it’s not just the marriage rate that has declined, it’s the idea of the role of marriage, that has.
Then there’s the less obvious but crucial side effect of a low marriage rate: the establishment of more small, often single-person households creates a need for more housing for which young adults must compete when supply lags. This is not a marginal demographic change. Marriage rates among young adults have fallen sharply over time, meaning fewer couples, more single adults, and therefore more households competing for limited units.
On this point, census data is clear. The average household size has steadily decreased, from 3.3 persons per household in 1960 to just 2.4 in 2024. At the same time, the number of overall households has steadily climbed, from 117 million in 2010 to 132 million in 2024. It’s an increase disproportionate to the increase in population, as measured by the number of households per million Americans, which increased during the same period from 380,744 to 390,171. That same figure increased from 295,090 in 1960.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
That increase, moreover, is driven by the fact that more of us live alone. Between 2010 and 2024, the number of single-person households increased from 31 million to 38 million, while the number of three-person households barely increased, from 18 million to 19 million. Even that figure may not reflect an increase of married couples with a child; many Gen Z members live with their parents into their 30s. In 1960, just 11% of men and 7% of women ages 25 to 34 lived with their parents, whereas in 2022, 19% of men and 12% of women were living in their parents’ homes.
It should be no surprise that Americans are said to be enduring anepidemic of loneliness: many of us are literally alone at home.

The increase in single-person households reflects more than thedeclining marriage rate, of course. Women live longer than men and thus elderly women tend to live alone. Men age 75 and older are nearly twice as likely (67%) as women (35%) to live with a spouse. Government housing policy adds to the problem. Public housing authorities give priority to those of lowest incomes for public housing or housing vouchers. Those inevitably turn out to be single mothers with children or older women without spouses. Only 3% of public or subsidized housing households are two adults with children.
It’s self-evident, though, that marriage can serve to ameliorate the housing affordability challenge in two ways: by serving to pool incomes and by reducing the demand for standalone households. Two heads are better than one, and in other words, one bed is better than two.

End woke teacher training,"Education Secretary Linda McMahon joins ‘The Sunday Briefing’ to discuss the potential dismantling of the Education Department, reacts to student math scores and talks reducing the impact of bureaucracy on schools.
For much of 2025, it looked like the right was winning its war on woke. PresidentDonald Trumpcame into office on a tidal wave of enthusiasm, and he launched a flurry of executive orders aimed at ending diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) and gender theory in schools.
But in early November, woke candidates came roaring back in elections in New York, Virginia and New Jersey. Woke is not dead — it is very much alive in educational institutions, public employee unions and other progressive enclaves. In fact, new data from Politics at Work, a combined data initiative of the University of Maryland and the University of Michigan, shows that the education sector is the single most left-leaning segment of employees in America. Democrats outnumber Republicans 2-to-1 in K-12 classrooms.
This would not be a problem if teacher-activists kept their politics separate from their work. But one need look no further than the proliferation of boys in girls’ sports, Black Lives Matter and pride flags on school walls, andDEI practicesto see that too many schools have become incredibly politicized places.
Why is the teaching profession so overwhelmingly left-wing, and why do so many of its members force their politics on kids? The answer is found on college and university campuses across the country, where teacher training programs indoctrinate their students in progressive ideology.

For instance, the University of Georgia requires its Elementary Education majors to take ""Exploring Socio-Cultural Perspectives on Diversity."" The course’s first objective is to imbue students with an understanding of ""diversity, equity, inclusion, and social justice in schooling."" A syllabus shows this course trains teachers to be foot soldiers of theprogressive movement: ""We are attempting to make a difference at the level of practice. This course doesn’t merely explain discrimination and oppression; it also supports developing anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-homophobic, anti-classist, anti-xenophobic, and social justice advocacy.""
Columbia University has historically been home to one of the country’s most prestigious teacher preparation programs. Lately, students there have been studying ""Making Change: Activism, Social Movements and Education."" This class teaches all the wrong lessons: It has students ""learn from the examples … the Chicago Teachers Union, the Tucson Unified School District fight for ethnics studies, BLM at Schools,"" and other progressive movements.
The Chicago Teachers Union and BLM are among the worst possible examples of education leadership. The former has delivered some of the worst academic achievement in the country and has refused to release a financial audit for five years running. The latter is trying to defund the police in schools, enact race-based hiring practices and institute failed ""restorative justice"" policies that eliminate discipline, allowing schools to devolve into chaos.
These misguided colleges are not alone. Future teachers at Michigan State University must endure six classes on ""Justice and Equity."" At the University of Maryland, future high school teachers are taught ""a social justice-oriented approach to teaching social studies."" Arizona State University is trainingfuture teachersin ""Education for Social Transformation"" and ""Inequality and Diversity in Education.""
""UNCOVERED DOCS SHOW TOP TEACHERS' UNION GUIDING GENDER TRANSITIONS, BASHING CONSERVATIVES: 'INSANE ASYLUM'

This is catastrophic for the United States. Any college that truly cares about the future should equip tomorrow’s teachers with the skills to correct it. Sadly, our future teachers are wasting their time and tuition dollars on how to engage with feminist pedagogies or inflictCritical Race Theory (CRT)on children.
As the public turns away from the false promises of radical progressivism, a new report from the Defense of Freedom Institute details how teacher unions remain a stronghold of wokeness in America. They routinely advocate forradical gender identity policies that allow boys in girls’ sportsand spaces, oppose school choice at every turn, and mobilize their teacher members to protest enforcement efforts to stop illegal immigration.

Any state that wants to eradicate DEI and CRT from its public schools should closely examine theteacher training programs at its state universities. Universities should take an honest look at whether they are helping teacher candidates become good educators or if they are training them to impart ideology rather than knowledge and skills.
Students’ needs are straightforward, but teacher training programs are churning out too many graduates with no ability to meet those needs. Wokeness in schools will end only if colleges stop training teachers to spread it.

But with PresidentDonald Trumpback in the White House and Democrats itching to rebound after last year's ballot box setbacks, 2025's off-year elections were anything but sedate.
Here are five of the biggest moments that shaped the campaign trail.
Just eight days into Trump's second term in the White House, demoralized Democrats had something to cheer about.

Democrat Mike Zimmer defeated Republican Katie Whittington in a special state Senate election in Iowa, flipping a Republican-controlled vacant seat in a district that Trump had carried by 21 points less than three months earlier.
Zimmer's victory triggered a wave of Democrats overperforming in special elections and regularly scheduled off-year ballot box contests.
In Iowa, Democrats in August flipped another Republican-held seat in a state Senate special election, breaking the GOP's supermajority in the upper chamber for the first time in three years.
""Since the president was inaugurated back in January, there's been 45 elections on the ballot. Democrats have overperformed in all of them to the tune of about 16 percentage points on average,"" Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin touted in a Fox News Digital interview days ahead of the2025 elections.
It was the issue that boosted Trump and Republicans in the 2024 elections, as they won back the White House and Senate majority and kept control of the House.
But a year later, the economy, and everyday expenses in particular, are working against the president and his party in the 2025 elections.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SAY WHITE HOUSE IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD ON ECONOMY
Democrats, with an across-the-board focus on affordability, enjoyed sweeping success at the ballot box earlier this month, with double-digit victories in the gubernatorial showdowns in blue-leaning but competitive New Jersey and Virginia, as well as major victories in high-profile contests in battlegrounds Georgia and Pennsylvania and solidly blue New York City and California.

""Voters are remarkably consistent in their priorities: the economy, the economy, the economy,"" noted Wayne Lesperance, a veteran political scientist and president of New England College.
""When you win an election, voters expect you are going to do something to address those concerns and the reality is that the questions of affordability remain unchanged in their importance to the everyday voter.""
Virginia Democrats were cruising toward convincing victories in the commonwealth's statewide elections when a scandal sent shockwaves up and down the ballot.

Jones acknowledged and apologized for texts he sent in 2022, when he compared then-Virginia House Speaker Todd Gilbert to mass murderers Adolf Hitler and Pol Pot, adding that if he was given two bullets, he would use both against the GOP lawmaker to shoot him in the head.
But Jones faced a chorus of calls from Republicans to drop out of the race.
KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2025 ELECTIONS
And the GOP leveraged the explosive revelations up the ballot, forcing Democratic Party nominee, former Rep. Abigail Spanberger, back on defense in a campaign where she was seen as the frontrunner against Republican rival Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears.
Earle-Sears didn't waste an opportunity to link Spanberger to Jones. And during last month's chaotic and only gubernatorial debate, where Earle-Sears repeatedly interrupted Spanberger, the GOP gubernatorial nominee called on her Democratic rival to tell Jones to end his attorney general bid.
""The comments that Jay Jones made are absolutely abhorrent,"" Spanberger said at the debate. But she neither affirmed nor pulled back her support of Jones.
While the scandal grabbed national headlines, in the end it didn't slow down the Democrats, as Spanberger crushed Earle-Sears by 15 points. Democrats won the separate election for lieutenant governor by 11 points and Jones even pulled off a 6-point victory over Republican incumbent Jason Miyares.
Aiming to prevent what happened during his first term in the White House when Democrats reclaimed the House majority in the 2018 midterm elections, Trump in June first floated the idea of rare but not unheard of mid-decade congressional redistricting.
The mission was simple: redraw congressional district maps in red states to pad the GOP's razor-thin House majority to keep control of the chamber in the 2026 midterms, when the party in power traditionally faces political headwinds and loses seats.
Trump's first target: Texas.
A month later, when asked by reporters about his plan to add Republican-leaning House seats across the country, the president said, ""Texas will be the biggest one. And that’ll be five.""
The push by Trump and his political team triggered a high-stakes redistricting showdown with Democrats to shape the 2026 midterm landscape in the fight for the House majority.
Republican Gov.Greg Abbottof Texas called a special session of the GOP-dominated state legislature to pass the new map.
ELECTION REFLECTION: 'DEMOCRATS FLIPPED THE SCRIPT' ON AFFORDABILITY IN BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWNS
But Democratic state lawmakers, who broke quorum for two weeks as they fled Texas in a bid to delay the passage of the redistricting bill, energized Democrats across the country.
Among those leading the fight against Trump's redistricting was Democratic Gov.Gavin Newsomof California.

California voters earlier this month overwhelmingly passed Proposition 50, a ballot initiative which will temporarily sidetrack the left-leaning state's nonpartisan redistricting commission and return the power to draw the congressional maps to the Democratic-dominated legislature.
That is expected to result in five more Democratic-leaning congressional districts in California, which aimed to counter the move by Texas to redraw their maps.
Meanwhile, an opinion by two federal judges in Texas this month delivered a blow to Trump and Republicans, by ruling that the state can't use the newly drawn map in next year's elections. Texas Republicans say they'll appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.
But the fight has spread beyond Texas and California.
Right-tilting Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio have drawn new maps as part of the president's push. And red-leaning Indiana, Florida and Kansas are also mulling redrawing their maps.
""We must keep the Majority at all costs,"" Trump wrote on social media this month.
Illinois and Maryland, two blue states, and Virginia, where Democrats control the legislature, are also taking steps or seriously considering redistricting.
And in a blow to Republicans, a Utah district judge this month rejected a congressional district map drawn up by the state's GOP-dominated legislature and instead approved an alternate that will create a Democratic-leaning district ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.
Zohran Mamdani's convincing June 24 victory in New York City's Democratic Party mayoral primary was the political earthquake that rocked the nation's most populous city and sent powerful shockwaves across the country.
The capturing of the Democratic nomination by the now-34-year-old socialist state lawmaker over frontrunner former Gov.Andrew Cuomoand nine other candidates propelled Mamdani to this month's general election victory.

While Mamdani's 9-point general election victory is a shot in the arm for the rise of the socialist movement as it battles moderate Democrats for the future of the party, it also appears to be the political gift that keeps on giving for Republicans, as they aim to paint all Democrats as far-left radicals.
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) was one of the first out of the gate to capitalize on the leftward lurch, firing off an email release minutes after Mamdani's primary victory, arguing that ""every vulnerable House Democrat will own him, and every Democrat running in a primary will fear him.""
And this month, immediately after Mamdani became mayor-elect, the NRCC claimed ""the new face of the Democrat Party just dropped, and it's straight out of a socialist nightmare.""

Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville argued Friday the changing economy has left young people behind, and Democrats must ditch radical cultural agendas to win their support.
Commentators on both the left and right have warned that there is an affordability crisis as young people struggle to join the middle class and live the same lifestyle previous generations did.
Housing prices continue to climb, while employers in key industries rely more heavily onforeign H-1B visa workers,contributing to tougher competition even for entry-level jobs.
Carville has repeatedly told Democrats there is a clear path to victory if they can simplyput aside ""woke"" ideologyand appeal to the rising tide of populism on both sides of politics.

The affordability crisis coupled with the rising cost of living, Carville said, is likely to persist.
""There’s several ways you can attack it, but one of the ways is you can pay people more,"" Carville said. ""And if you look at, if you want to know the rage in this country since — let's just say 2009 is the starting point, 2010 — and you look at corporate profits growth and look at real hourly wage growth — I'm just going to say that the economic system in the United States has got to change, and it's gone way too far in favoring old people, favoring savers, favoring homeowners, favoring all the stuff that we all — and it'sscrewed this younger generation.
""And I'm telling you, you know, I would say the same thing to anybody is, ‘You better fix this, or it's going to get fixed for you, and it's not — it's going to be ugly when it gets fixed for you. People are tired of it.’""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/broadcast-bias-maybe-nancy-pelosi-could-get-mount-rushmore-house-speakers,BROADCAST BIAS: Maybe Nancy Pelosi could get on the Mount Rushmore of House speakers,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Former House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., finally announced what everyone expected, that she would not run for office again now that she’s 85. It’s the end of an era, an era of broadcast TV flattery and shamelessness. Pelosi has wielded great power over her members, and also great power over the national media. She viciously attacks any reporter that asks her a question she doesn’t want to answer. In recent years, the big networks have been putty in her hands.
This starts with the issue of her husband Paul’s aggressive financial trading, and her quiet opposition to any attempt to restrict members of Congress from trading stocks, which is on the agenda again. Back in 2011, CBS’s ""60 Minutes"" cooperated with conservative author Peter Schweizer when his book ""Throw Them All Out"" was published. Since then, the issue has largely vanished.
A New York Post analysisrevealed that before first taking office in 1987, Pelosi and her husband reported between $610,000 and $785,000 in stocks in their portfolio — worth $133.7 million today, according to the latest estimates from Quiver Quantitative. That means that Nancy Pelosi grew her little nest egg by 16,930%.
In the last four years, the gush from the press has been remarkably excessive. Stock trading didn’t come up in 2022 in a George Stephanopoulos interview on ABC’s ""This Week."" Stephanopoulos asked then-Speaker Pelosi: ""the [Biden] White House is warning of an imminent invasion of Ukraine. The Ukrainians seem to think that’s all hype. Do you believe that Putin is poised to invade?"" Stephanopoulos even asked Pelosi if ""Congress [is] doing everything you can to prevent an invasion?"" Most laughably, he asked her what ""should President Putin know from you, the speaker of the House, about the consequences of invasion?""
FIVE TIMES NANCY PELOSI LOST HER COOL WITH THE MEDIA

When Democrats lost the House in the midterms, Pelosi relinquished her post as Democrat leader, but the encomiums never stopped. On CBS’s ""Sunday Morning"" in early 2024, substitute host Tracy Smith announced, ""House Speaker Emerita that has a new book out, ‘The Art of Power’ — an art which Nancy Pelosi is something of a master.""
Pelosi also gushed, proclaiming PresidentJoe Bidenwas at the ""top of his game. Such a consequential president of the United States, a Mount Rushmore kind of president of the United States."" Lesley Stahl asked if she was serious: ""Lincoln and Joe Biden?"" Pelosi underlined it: ""You got Teddy Roosevelt up there, and he’s wonderful. I don’t say take him down, but you can add Biden.""
Stahl just had to follow up that comedy with flattery: ""If there were a Mount Rushmore for speakers of the House, Nancy Pelosi would certainly be up there, commemorating her 20 years as acommanding leader in Congress."" If there's a stellar achievement on Pelosi's résumé, it has to be how impressively she and her husband have enriched themselves while she was in ""public service.""
NANCY PELOSI'S CRITICS CELEBRATE RETIREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT
Two weeks before the 2024 election, CNN and PBS host Christiane Amanpour read a virulently anti-Trump passage from Pelosi’s book. It was about his ""repeatedly stomping out of meetings, his foul mouth, his pounding on tables, his temper tantrums, his disrespect for our nation’s patriots, and his total separation from reality and actual events."" Then Amanpour asked: ""How did you deal with that? And do you think this country, your country, can survive another term?"" What would America do without Pelosi?
On the one-year anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot, ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt was a soft touch. He walked through the hallways of the Capitol with her and noted they ""desecrated your office"" and one rioter wrote he wanted to ""shoot her in her freaking brain."" Pelosi said the memory ""breaks your heart. It’s like somebody in the White House dropped a bomb on the Congress.""
Holt concluded with the devout Catholic angle: ""You’ve been very vocal in the past about praying for your adversaries."" She said, ""I always do,"" but the current Republican Party ""melted down into a cult.""
Perhaps the most servile interviewer was ""PBS NewsHour"" co-anchor Geoff Bennett, who interviewed Pelosi in front of a PBS crowd in California in May. He began by gushing to the crowd that Pelosi, who did the interview remotely from Boston, is ""known for herpolitical leadership, her sharp insights and her real singular ability to keep Democrats united.""

Bizarrely, Bennett expressed shock that the Democrats weren’t getting credit for the economy: ""Having coveredDemocratic policies, you can say objectively that Democrats did have policies that benefited the middle class! And Joe Biden spent a lot of political capital passing them into law and yet it didn’t seem to resonate, didn’t connect with the American people in this last election.""
Stahl just had to follow up that comedy with flattery: ""If there were a Mount Rushmore for speakers of the House, Nancy Pelosi would certainly be up there, commemorating her 20 years as a commanding leader in Congress.""
Pelosi generously said the stupid voters shouldn’t be blamed: ""When somebody doesn't get a message, it's not because of them. It's because of us who are delivering the message, that we did not deliver it clearly enough.""

This didn't feel like a ""newsmaker interview."" It felt like a journalistic version of ""Driving Miss Daisy.""

Key grocery staples such as produce and dairy are pricier than last year, so experts say shoppers should be selective, starting with these five items that are rarely a good deal in bulk.
Fruits and vegetables likeberries, avocados, bananasand spinach rarely survive long enough for smaller households to get their money's worth, savvy shoppers say.

""You're not going to go through that food fast enough to have it at its freshest, unless you're having guests,"" Trae Bodge, a New Jersey-based shopping expert and brand strategist, told Fox News Digital. ""You can certainly break these rules a little bit during the holidays.""
Shoppers should avoid one especially tempting bulk item — pre-cutfruit salad— unless it's being served immediately, she said.

Bread often goes stale or moldy long before families can finish the giant twin- or triple-packs sold at warehouse stores.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-making-life-affordable-again-every-american-heres-how,"Trump is making life affordable again for every American, and here's how","National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett joins 'Sunday Morning Futures' to weigh in on the potential economic fallout if Trump’s tariffs are struck down in the Supreme Court and rising tensions over China’s rare-earth minerals.
Democrats’ favorite word lately is ""affordability."" They have painted the false narrative that the election of socialist Mayor Zohran Mamdani in solidly blue New York City or Democrat Gov. Abigail Spanberger in solidly blue Virginia were somehow referenda on President Donald Trump’s agenda. This fallacy not only ignores the recent past but also misses the facts immediately in front of us that Trump’s policies are making America affordable again.
Prices soared during the Biden administration. Inflation rose at a near 5% annualized rate during his term. Such a disaster is second only to the severe Carter-led inflation of the 1970s, which collapsed U.S. living standards. Contrast this with Trump’s first term, when inflation rose at less than a 2% annualized rate.
The memory of low inflation and strongeconomic growthduring Trump’s first term inspired Americans to re-elect him for a second term. Voters put their trust in Trump’s stewardship after a disastrous four years of economic hardship under Biden. Immediately after taking office, Trump began laying the groundwork for a Golden Age economy. While there is still much work ahead to help Americans out of the hole created by the Biden administration, we are making progress.
The first step was passing theOne Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB), which will help Make America Affordable Again. There are three key provisions in the OBBB that will boost take-home worker pay.

First is permanent full expensing ofbusiness investment, or what is commonly referred to as capital expenditures (or ""capex""). Thanks to this bold tax incentive, companies can now write off the full cost of purchasing computers, industrial machinery, software and any other equipment. When firms raise their capex, productivity increases, since workers have additional capital to produce the goods and services businesses and consumers want. Greater productivity, in turn, raises household living standards by providing companies the ability to pay their workers more. Economic history is replete with examples when surging productivity produced large increases in worker wages.
The second provision in the OBBB dovetails with the capex incentive but may be even more powerful. Companies can now deduct the entire cost ofbuilding a manufacturing plantor agricultural structure in the first year of construction.
In the past, companies had to wait nearly 40 years to depreciate the full cost of factories and farm structure. But not anymore. This novel tax incentive will lead to a massive increase in industrial building and support reshoring of our supply chains. With that will comehigh-paying construction jobs. And when the project is done, there will be high-paying jobs inside those structures, where workers will be using the newest technologies thanks to the capex incentives. The effect will be an industrial boom.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
In tandem, a capex and industrial construction boom will increase the economy’s underlying productive capacity, which in the past has always been disinflationary. This means that inflation is poised to fall much further, thereby giving workers an added lift. This is a one-two punch in restoring worker purchasing power because nominal wages will be rising at the same time inflation will be falling. The upshot is a powerful historical gain in real wages, similar but even bigger than Trump’s first term.
The third provision that will improve affordability is notax on tips or overtime pay. By eliminating these taxes, working Americans will get to keep more of their hard-earned income. This is critical to restoring household finances to lower- and middle-class families, who suffered disproportionately under the prior administration. Real after-tax wages for blue collar workers are poised to soar thanks to Trump’s policies and economic vision.

Guaranteed basic income programs have become a trend across the U.S. in recent years with more than100 pilots launched since 2018. Mayors for Guaranteed Income grew into a coalition of 150 mayors pushing pilot programs, offering low-income participants up to $1,000 a month with no strings attached. The group has pushed pilot programs that have been adopted bymunicipalities across the country.
The Cook County program was launched in 2022with the aid of federal COVID-19 relief funds.
Once the largest publicly funded program in the nation receiving $42 million in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act, the Cook County Promise Guaranteed Income Pilot provided monthly payments of $500 to 3,250 households for two years, with no strings attached.
Economic Security Illinois Director Sarah Saheb described Cook County’s guaranteed basic income pilot as a ""historic success"" and said that when the federal government was ""stepping back from its responsibilities to working families, Cook County is leading the way to ensure people can afford basic necessities.""
The commissioners told Fox News Digital that the decision to extend the program into permanence was based on findingsfrom a surveyon the county's pilot program.

The findings released by the commission in April showed that three-quarters of participants reported feeling more financially secure and 94% of participants used the funds to address financial emergencies during challenging times. Majorities also reported the program improved their mental health and lowered their stress levels.
The commission learned from the survey that participants mainly used the funds for essential needs such as food, rent, utilities, and transportation.

Thanksgiving is often cast as a holiday of unity, but it has also become a microcosm of the country's fractures.
What winds up being served forThanksgiving dinner,who shows up — or doesn't — and whether politics gets mentioned, can reflect broader shifts in ideology and culture. Simultaneously, Thanksgiving is still intended to bridge divides and emphasize the magnificence of the great American experiment launched centuries ago.
One example of this is the food Americans choose to eat on Thanksgiving and how they make it.
6 CLASSIC THANKSGIVING SIDE DISHES THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED FROM AMERICAN TABLES
Take-out and dine-in options have become more widely adopted in contemporary Thanksgiving celebrations, with research from restaurant software company Popmenu finding a 42% increase from 2024 in the number of folks who plan to order from, or dine-in at, a restaurant on Thanksgiving. Costs were a primary reason for the shift, along with wanting to spend more time with family and not worry about cooking.

The length of time spent at the dinner table can also be quite telling.
In 2018, university researchers analyzed smartphone location data pings and determined that ""politically diverse"" Thanksgiving dinners tended to be significantly shorter than those dinners involving a family of entirely like-minded individuals. The study, conducted in 2018, showed the average dinner was 30 minutes to 50 minutes shorter at tables full of politically diverse folks, while a study measuring the same thing in 2020 found politically diverse dinners to be about 24 minutes shorter on average.
Meanwhile, other Thanksgiving survey data from 2025, published by YouGov, found that 19% of Democrats expect to have political arguments at the dinner table, compared to 9% of Republicans.

It is hard to say overall whether Thanksgiving diners have gotten longer or shorter, but according to theU.S. Department of Agriculture'sEconomic Research Service, people typically spend around 128 minutes on meal preparation and cleanup, 89 minutes on eating and drinking, and about 148 minutes socializing, according to a long-term analysis conducted between 2003 and 2015.
According to the National Turkey Federation, 94% of Americans plan to celebrate Thanksgiving.
The group added that 87% of those who celebrate say turkey is part of their holiday tradition, with 74% planning to serve an entire bird.

However, simultaneously, other findings from turkey producer Jennie-O indicated that there is a growing openness for less traditional Thanksgiving meal options, which the group said shows a ""blend of old and new is redefining what Thanksgiving dinner looks like across America.""
The turkey product brand noted that 55% of Americans were ""open to trying Thanksgiving recipes from different cultures,"" particularly via side dishes.
Even the changing treatment of the turkeys used for thepresidential pardonhas shifted slightly over the years.
In the early-2000s, turkeys that were presented were sometimes unnamed, or treated more anonymously, but more recently it has become standard to dub the turkeys with names and humanize them a bit.

This Thanksgiving, I am taking a moment to reflect on the many blessings we enjoy, especially the hard work America’s farmers and ranchers do day in and day out to produce an abundant and affordable food supply.
And this year, we have even more to be thankful for, as theThanksgiving dinneris returning to normal prices following record inflation during the Biden administration.
Like the entire agricultural community, turkey farmers work year-round to supply our Thanksgiving tables with the food we know and love.
In 2024, that meant raising 200 million turkeys on about 2,500 farms across the United States, with the majority being family farms. This is no small feat, especially while our farmers face the risk ofbird fluand many other challenges that impact our small businesses across the country.

But they continue to do what their parents did and their parents before them: tend the flock and continue the noble act of feeding their fellow citizens.
And PresidentDonald Trumphas their backs.
He’s supportingAmerican farmersacross the country to ensure they have what they need to continue to supply America with affordable food — that includes unleashing American energy to lower gas prices, boost domestic fertilizer production, cut regulations to lower the cost of doing business, and most importantly, cut taxes so farmers can keep more of what they earn.
All of this helps create an economic environment where our farmers and ranchers thrive like never before.
Since day one, the Trump administration has been on a mission to tame Biden’s inflation crisis, stop the sky-high price increases, and lower costs for everyday families. While this course correction can’t happen overnight, we are working every day across the federal government to Make America Affordable Again.
Under PresidentJoe Biden, we had record-high prices, at $64.05 for the average Thanksgiving meal for 10 people. Now, under Trump — after just nine months in office — it’s down to only $55.18, or $5.52 per person.

As we approach Thanksgiving once again, let’s embrace a spirit of gratitude for all the blessings God has given this nation — starting with President Donald J. Trump.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/prices-remain-high-bigger-worry-now-falling-incomes,Weakening incomes add new strain to households already hit by high prices,"'The Guy Benson Show' host joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss how the Trump administration plans to tackle the affordability crisis and the president's possible meeting with Mamdani.
For months, Americans have voiced frustration over the stubbornly high cost of living.
But economists say a more troubling shift is emerging. Consumers are increasingly reporting that their incomes aren’t keeping up with the financial pressures they face.
Joanne Hsu, director and chief economist of the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, says the change is showing up more clearly in recent readings.
""Consumers have been expressing frustration from high prices consistently for the past several years. What makes this season different is that consumers are also increasingly mentioning weakening incomes as well,"" Hsu told Fox News Digital.

""This year, they are reporting pressures on their pocketbooks from multiple sources.""

That sense of mounting pressure is backed up by recent analysis.
According to theBank of America Institute, inflation has risen faster than middle- and lower-income households’ after-tax wages since January 2025.
As a result, nearly one in four U.S. households is now livingpaycheck to paycheck, a number that has grown during the past year.
NEARLY 1 IN 4 AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK, REPORT REVEALS
What that means is that the erosion of purchasing power is pushing more Americans to the edge of their budgets, making it harder to keep up, let alone get ahead.

That growing strain presents a political challenge for PresidentDonald Trump, who returned to the White House on promises of greater affordability. He is now confronting voter doubts about whether he can deliver.
AFox News national surveyshows 76% of voters now rate the economy negatively, up sharply from 67% in July and 70% at the end of former President Joe Biden's term.
Trump’s economic approval has also slipped to a new low, and his overall job approval has climbed to record levels of disapproval, even among voters who have historically backed him.

How quickly that changes and whether voters give Trump credit for it may determine the tone of the country’s economic and political debate in the months ahead.

Suzan DelBene, in a Fox News Digital interview, says her party will ‘ hold Republicans accountable’ in the 2026 midterm elections.
Democrats, energized by their convincing victories earlier this month in the2025 elections, are betting those results foreshadow a House flip in next year's midterm showdowns.
The party out of power needs a net gain of just three seats to grab back the majority from the Republicans, who've controlled the House for nearly three years. And the party in power, which nowadays is clearly the Republicans, traditionally faces political headwinds in the midterm elections.
At stake: the success of PresidentDonald Trump's second-term agenda.
""We'll take back the House in 2026,"" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chair Rep. Suzan DelBene of Washington state told Fox News Digital.
DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, GO ALL IN ON FINAL CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION SHOWDOWN OF THE YEAR
Butfor Republicans, aiming to protect their fragile majority, the magic number is also three.
""The only number I'm concerned about is three. We have three Republicans in seatsKamala Harriscarried,"" said Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee. He pointed to districts carried during the 2024 presidential election by then-Vice President Kamala Harris.
HOUSE GOP CAMPAIGN CHAIR WANTS TRUMP 'OUT THERE ON THE TRAIL' IN MIDTERM BATTLE FOR MAJORITY
And Hudson, in a Fox News Digital interview, highlighted that Democrats have ""13 sitting in seats Donald Trump won. They've got 21 more sitting in seats that Donald Trump barely lost. So there, there are only a few seats up for grabs this time, most of them are Democrat seats.""
The most recent national polls indicate Democrats with the upper hand in the 2026 battle for theHouse majority.
But DelBene cautioned, ""We take nothing for granted.""
And Hudson was optimistic that Republicans would ""grow our House majority.""

High prices and out-of-control cost of living were key issues that boostedTrumpand Republicans in the 2024 elections, as they won back the White House and Senate majority and kept control of the House.
But what a difference a year makes.
Democrats, with an across-the-board focus on affordability, overperformed at the polls as they enjoyed sweeping ballot box success earlier this month. Democrats scored double-digit gubernatorial wins in blue-leaning but competitive New Jersey and Virginia, and convincing victories in high-profile showdowns in battlegrounds Georgia and Pennsylvania and left-tilting New York City and California.
""It was clear that when folks are talking about the biggest issues affecting their communities, and right now, affordability, with the rising costs people have seen as a result of the policies put in place by this administration and Republicans in Congress, they rejected that,"" DelBene said as she pointed to the2025 election results.
DEMOCRATS DOUBLE-DOWN ON THIS KEY ISSUE
""Absolutely, we saw that in governor's races like Virginia and New Jersey, but [also] in races across the country,"" she added.
The most recentFox News national pollwas another warning sign for Trump and the GOP.
Three-quarters of voters questioned in the survey viewedthe economynegatively, and large numbers of respondents, including Republicans, said their costs for groceries, utilities, healthcare and housing have gone up this year.
The poll indicated that voters blame the president, with nearly twice as many pointing fingers at Trump than former PresidentJoe Biden, when asked who is responsible for the current economy.
Only 38% of those questioned gave the president a thumbs-up to how he's handling the economy. And Trump's overall approval rating, at 41%, was the lowest of his second term in office in Fox News polling.
""Affordability is still the number one issue for families. Housing, food, health care, child care, energy costs all going up directly as a result of policies put in place by Republicans in Congress and Donald Trump. And they promised to lower costs on day one,"" DelBene said.
SETTING THE STAGE: WHAT THE 2025 ELECTIONS SIGNAL FOR NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM SHOWDOWNS
Pointing to last year's elections, she said, ""That was their big message. They were going to lower costs. It has been a big broken promise, and people are feeling that and and that's had a big impact and will continue. People want folks who are going to stand up to them for them, not just be blindly loyal to the president.""
Hudson, asked about the political impact of the cost of living, took aim at the former president.
""There are challenges out there with the economy, because Biden broke it, and House Republicans, working with President Trump, are going to fix it, and we're working very hard to do that,"" he said.

""Certainly, we could always improve the way we communicate with our voters about it,"" he added. ""But we are laser-focused on the issues that matter to them. You know, it's the cost of things, it's the security in their neighborhood, it's a secure border. We are very focused on that, and we've delivered a lot of things that are going to make their lives better.""
DEMOCRATS SEE MANDATE AFTER 2025 WINS — REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S A MIRAGE
And looking ahead to next year, he added, ""Come tax season, a lot of families are going to be really happy to see they've got a lot more take-home pay, and that's because of Donald Trump and House Republicans.""
The DCCC, in its messaging, has tied vulnerable House Republicans to Trump.
DelBene argued that it's ""Republican policies that are hurting American families, the tariffs that Donald Trump has put in place that have raised costs for families across the country, their ongoing work to gut healthcare across this country.""
And she charged that the ""policies that they have prioritized have been favoring the wealthy and the well-connected, tax breaks for the wealthy and the well-connected, but hurting working families across the country. People are feeling that, and we're going to continue to call that out.""
Hudson called the 2025 elections a ""wake-up call"" for GOP voters and that he wants Trump ""out there on the trail"" in next year's midterms.

Plenty of Republicans have downplayed the Democrats' high-profile victories, noting they largely took place in blue-leaning states.
Hudson noted the top elections took place in ""Democrat states,"" but added, ""I think our big takeaway as Republicans is the Democrats were energized. They turned out at record levels. Republicans turned out in normal levels.""
""I think there's a wake-up call there to conservatives and Republicans who are happy with the direction of the country. They're glad President Trump's back in the White House. But if they want to keep this momentum going, they've got to show up and vote,"" he said.
Many of Trump's MAGA supporters are considered low-propensity voters, who head to the polls only when Trump is on the ballot. But Trump won't be on the ballot in the 2026 midterms.

Hudson, who noted that ""House Republicans are very closely aligned with President Trump, and we're supporting his agenda,"" said that ""we want him out there on the trail, campaigning with our candidates. I think he brings a lot of energy.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/black-friday-dont-let-swipeflation-swipe-1400-your-holiday-cash,"This Black Friday, don’t let ‘Swipeflation’ swipe $1,400 of your holiday cash","Fox News correspondent Alexis McAdams reports on retailers bracing for the holiday shopping season on 'Your World.'
Black Fridayis the busiest shopping day of the year, and most of us approach it with a plan. We hunt for deals, compare prices and try to stretch our dollars a little further. What few people think about is the cost that gets added at the very moment we tap or insert a credit card. It’s called a swipe fee, and it hurts consumers and small businesses alike.
Every time you pay with a credit card, the bank and the card network take a percentage of the purchase. For each $100 spent, anywhere from $2 to $4 goes to them even before the store gets the rest. Most shoppers never notice. And with razor-thin profits in retail and food industries, that 2% to 4% can be as much or more than the small business makes on the sale.
In 2024, these swipe fees added a record $187 billion total, or about $1,400 in extra costs for every household. Swipeflation is real. That helps explain why more stores now add credit card fees or offer discounts for paying with cash. A recent WalletHub survey found that 80% of consumers reported paying a surcharge on a credit card purchase in the past year.
KURT 'THE CYBER GUY' KNUTSSON'S TIPS FOR SAFE HOLIDAY SHOPPING
Shop owners and restaurateurs are not trying to nickel-and-dime customers. They’re just trying to entice customers to use lower-cost forms of payment like cash or debit, which don’t come with the same high swipe fees that credit card companies charge. After years of inflation, higher rent, increased labor costs and rising supply prices, they are just trying to stay in business. About 92% of small business owners say their costs have increased since 2020, and rising costs still top their list of concerns in 2025.
This holiday season, be careful how you pay for your gifts to avoid ""swipeflation.""(iStock)
The irony is that inflation is a boon for credit card company profits. As restaurants, groceries and household goods get more expensive, card companies collect more money without offering anything additional in return. Picture your local café after a day of shopping. The cost of a basic meal has climbed about 40% since 2019 due toinflation in food and labor costs. What used to be a $15 burger, fries, and drink now costs $21. Families pay more at the counter, and credit card companies come out ahead because they collect a percentage of every sale.
PROTECT YOUR DATA BEFORE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SCAMS STRIKE
Many consumers stick with credit cards because they want the rewards. Airline miles, hotel points or cash back can feel like a perk. But research shows that the credit card rewards game only works out well for the very highest earners. When you factor in how built-in swipe fees increase the cost of almost everything consumers buy, most of us actually lose between $300 to $500 each year, even after counting credit card rewards.

There is good news. Consumers have more control over these costs than they might think, which could come in handy during the biggest shopping season of the year. A few small changes can help youprotect your walletand support the local businesses you care about.
First, take a moment to read the merchant’s policy on credit card fees. Sometimes it’s on a sign at check-out; sometimes it’s at the bottom of the bill. Consider taking advantage of discounts merchants offer when paying with cash or debit. If the business doesn’t offer a discount, you might ask them to consider that option in the future. Otherwise, they are probably building in the swipe fee into the cost of everything, even if you pay with cash.

You can also apply these tips onGiving Tuesday. The same 2% to 4% swipe fees apply to online donations made with credit cards as well. Using a debit card or sending money directly from a bank account helps your donation go further.
Millions of Americans will swipe their cards without a second thought this Black Friday. Be an informed consumer and know before you swipe. Choosing how to pay can be just as important as choosing where to shop. Behind every one of those transactions is a small business trying to keep its doors open and keep prices reasonable for shoppers. Understanding swipeflation, and adjusting how you pay, can make a real difference for both your budget and your community.

Beijing has repeatedly shown the world that it is willing to weaponize its dominance of supply chains, and PresidentDonald Trumphad to de-escalate the latest rare-earth dispute during his recent trip to Asia. But rare earths are only a small window into the power that China could have over the U.S. economy as we start adopting tomorrow’s technologies.
Three technologies stand out as especially critical to America’s national security as we look out over the next decade:artificial intelligence, quantum computing and biotechnology. Much like China can exert leverage over U.S. manufacturing through rare earths today, we are at risk of significant and growing Chinese leverage in these foundational technologies.
In fact, American dependence on Chinese supply chains is already becoming evident.American leadership in AIhinges on U.S. data centers maintaining access to specialized chemicals, printed circuit boards and networking equipment from China. China controls critical inputs for quantum computing, including cooling equipment, precision lasers and several essential minerals.
CHINA WEAPONIZED SCIENCE AGAINST THE US. WE'VE FIGURED OUT A KEY ELEMENT THEY MISSED
Perhaps most concerning, China is the sole supplier of at least one critical ingredient for more than a third of nearly 2,000 U.S.-approved medicines, including amoxicillin, one of the most widely prescribed antibiotics, according to a recent study.

The United States still holds powerful cards to play. The U.S.private sector leadsthe world in spending on research and development, and U.S. capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world, capable of financing ambitious projects. The talented American workforce, from machinists to STEM researchers, is well-positioned to build and benefit from the return of critical supply chains.
But creative incentives are needed to unleash these advantages. Our newreportdetails how to do it. The United States must act now and bear the costs to de-risk critical supply chains, or it may pay a much higher price later if tensions escalate. Building on the Trump administration’s progress in rare earths, the U.S. government should incentivize domestic production of several dozen critical inputs for semiconductors and data centers, including various chemicals and hardware components, as well as essential materials for quantum computing and biotechnology, like cooling equipment and drug inputs.

Government action is also needed to mobilizeprivate investmenttoward quantum computing and biotechnology. The Department of Defense should use its procurement power, along with contracting milestones, to create demand and competition for the delivery of a viable quantum computer that is powerful and reliable enough to solve real-world problems faster than today’s best supercomputers. Incentivizing private investment into biomanufacturing hubs nationwide would help smaller firms bring new technologies to market by co-funding shared manufacturing infrastructure and easing regulations for expansion.
While economic security begins at home, America is not alone in this race. The European Union, Japan and South Korea have pledged investments that could help strengthen U.S. manufacturing and critical supply chains. When the U.S. government stockpiles essential drug ingredients or critical minerals, it should look to trusted markets. Several allies have capabilities that could help accelerate and expand new sources of critical minerals, as illustrated by the recent framework struck by the United States and Australia.

We know from firsthand experience that the U.S. government can utilize its full toolkit for today’s era of economic warfare and position itself to compete in the technologies that have yet to arrive. U.S. agencies and departments are often too siloed to have a full view of today’s vulnerabilities or those risks just beginning to emerge. Establishing an Economic Security Center would strengthen government coordination, upgrade technical expertise and deepen partnerships with the private sector.
There is strong bipartisan support for strengthening critical supply chains and significant progress upon which to build. We must sustain that momentum to ensure the American economy is able to compete — and win — in this new era of technology.

New York City mayor-electZohran Mamdaniannounced a new economic and workforce development transition team that will be headed by, among others, reparations activist Darrick Hamilton, who argues the U.S. economy and governmental policies related to it are racist.
Hamilton, who went to Oberlin College and later the University of Carolina at Chapel Hill, is the founding director of the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy at the progressive The New School university in New York City. Hamilton's academic biography at The New School calls him a ""pioneer"" in the field of ""stratification economics,"" which is aimed at looking at how race and ethnicity are embedded into ""inequality"" in education, economic and health outcomes.
Mamdani announced Monday the creation of more than 17 transition advisory committees made up of more than 400 people to help advise his incoming administration, including the Committee on Economic Development & Workforce Development, which Hamilton will help lead.
MAMDANI'S TOP INCOMING AIDE WAS ‘CHIEF ARCHITECT’ OF RADICAL PROPOSAL OVERHAULING NYPD
""Since our nation’s inception, the immoral devaluation of Black lives has been ingrained in America’s political economy, and (has) manifested in a persistent, unjust, and enormous racial wealth gap,"" Hamilton told Congress in 2021. ""Our unjust racial wealth gap is itself an implicit measure of our racist past that is rooted in a history in which whites have been privileged by (a) government complicit (in) political and economic intervention(s) that have afforded them access to resources and iterative and intergenerational accumulation.""

Hamilton also sits on theNew York State Community Commission on Reparations Remedies,where he advises members of the New York State legislature on policy recommendations for ""reparative justice,"" as it relates to ""the historical and present-day consequences of slavery and discrimination.""
One proposal Hamilton is known for is socioeconomic-based ""Baby Bonds,"" which would essentially establish racially conscious trust funds for children. The Baby Bonds would be given a certain amount of seed funding depending upon determined need, and would grow until the kids become adults and can use the money.
Hamilton has argued that one-time reparations payments do not go far enough and steps, such as the Baby Bonds proposal, should be taken to help Black folks garner ownership of ""means of production in American society."" Meanwhile, Hamilton has been criticized for allegedly wanting to add Black immigrants to reparations policies, as opposed to making them exclusively for the descendants of slavery.
Yvette Carnell, a prominent activist and co-founder of the American Descendants of Slavery (ADOS) movement, has also called Hamilton""clueless""and accused the scholar of kowtowing to whichever politician is in power.

""The racial wealth gap is such that the typical Black family has about 10 cents on the dollar as a typical white family,"" Hamilton said during a 2020 podcast episode on Freakonomics Radio. ""That history of racial disparity, as it relates to wealth-building, certainly didn’t end with slavery,"" Hamilton added. ""There was the Homestead Act. There was the G.I. Bill. There was a system of sharecropping. There’s a system ofJim Crow.There is a system of redlining. It was government-facilitated.""
UNEARTHED ANTISEMITIC, ANTI-ISRAEL POSTS FROM MAMDANI AIDE SPARK GOP OUTRAGE
During a separate appearance on The Black News Channel, Hamilton also said he is not one to ""compromise"" on policy either, when asked why Democrats are always ""compromising with crazy people.""
""I don't like the word compromise … because one thing we know is that when we think about race, the group that is typically the first to be compromised are the issues related to those that are most marginalized, which in the United States' context has been Black people,"" Hamilton said during the 2021 Black News Chanel interview.
""We need government to start doing good,"" Hamilton continued, ""because when people realize the government can do good it creates a momentum, a movement forward that makes it harder for us to turn back.""

Not long after Mamdani won his election and began nominating members to his transition team, he faced backlash for staffing his team with aides from former NYC mayoral campaigns, ranging from Bill de Blasio, to Michael Bloomberg to Eric Adams. Mamdani also tapped a longtime Biden adviser to help lead his transition that garnered criticism.
""The polls have barely closed, and already the incoming mayor is breaking one of his core promises to shake up the status quo and usher in a new day. New York City started a downward spiral under the de Blasio administration, and now some of its main players are returning to the halls of power,"" Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News Digital.

Americans are heading into the holidays uneasy about the economy, even as inflation slowly cools.
As the holidays approach, Thanksgiving has become a kind of national check-in on PresidentDonald Trump's economic stewardship and whether voters believe his affordability promises are finally paying off.
That uncertainty is reflected in how consumers are approaching the holidays, cautious about big purchases but still willing to spend selectively when they find value. That mix of caution and compromise is something Joanne Hsu, director and chief economist of the University of Michigan’s Surveys of Consumers, has been tracking closely.

""It is possible, however, that consumers may still be willing to spend on smaller-ticket items. That said, it is likely that consumers will be looking for value and the best way to stretch their dollars given that they generally do not feel confident about the economy at this time,"" Hsu added.

That disconnect between improving data and persistent pessimism poses a political challenge for Trump, who rode promises of affordability back to the White House but is now confronting voter doubts about whether that promise is being met.
According to aFox News national survey, 76% of voters rate the economy negatively, compared with 67% in July and 70% at the close of former PresidentJoe Biden’stenure. Voters largely blame Trump for the downturn, with about twice as many holding him responsible for the current economy as Biden, and three times as many saying his policies have hurt them personally.
At the same time, approval of Trump’s handling of the economy has dropped to a new low, while disapproval of his overall job performance has climbed to record highs, even among some of his core supporters.
Democrats leaned heavily on affordability themes in state and local elections this fall and it paid off.
In places like Virginia, New York and New Jersey, where voters have been squeezed by highhousing costsand utility bills, Democratic candidates seized on Trump’s early economic moves, including his trade policy, to argue that his policies were worsening the affordability crisis rather than easing it.

They promised to rein in energy costs, expand affordable housing and protect middle-class wages, a message that resonated with voters and analysts say, reflects a broader trend: in aneconomywhere many still feel stretched thin, the party that speaks most directly to people’s pocketbooks often wins.
""I think they made a real strategic blunder back in January and February and that is that the president ran on inflation and promised to lower prices and then his very first and most prominent policy moves were to enact policies that were going to increase prices,"" Scott Lincicome, the vice president of general economics at Cato’s Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies, told Fox News Digital.

""Americans aren't stupid, and they can put two and two together. If the guy who promised you lower prices then suddenly promises to raise prices and prices go up, well, guess what? That guy is going to get blamed,"" Lincicome added.
For Trump, the real test may come not from economic data but from dinner-table conversations. If Americans don’t yet feel the relief he promised, this Thanksgiving could reveal just how far affordability remains out of reach.

Is America on the verge of an incredible comeback? Or is America in decline?
You’ve, no doubt, heard (or even asked) these questions as our country prepares for its 250th birthday next year — July 4, 2026, the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. It feels like everyone is asking these questions.
For the first time in recorded history, fewer than half of Americans think our best days are ahead of us. More people think that our best days are in the rearview mirror. Four out of five Americans now believe their children’s lives will be worse than theirs. That number has doubled in just 20 years. And when it comes to the long run, more Americans worry that someone born in the future will be worse off than someone born in the past.
But is it true? Is America really in decline? I’ve asked myself this question, too. And my answer is a resounding: No!

I don’t think we’re declining. I think we’re drifting. There’s a big difference. We don’t feel anchored to the core ideas that created the American experiment and theAmerican Dream. We’re getting taken by the current and blown by the wind. But while that’s not the same thing as decline, it’s a dangerous thing, nonetheless. America was never meant to drift. America is supposed to courageously move forward, lifting up our people and leading our world.
Let me be clear: America remains thestrongest country on Earthby so many measures. But we’re not moving to where we need to go and what we need to be. The good news is that we can get the country back on track. We just need to remember who we are and what we stand for — and then we need to build a future on the time-tested principles that made us great in the first place.
What are those principles? Belief in people. Free enterprise. The family. Accountability and human dignity. Every generation of Americans has applied these principles to overcome challenges and move past division. And that’s what we need to do today.
AT LANCASTER MARKET, I WITNESSED AN AMERICA THAT STILL WORKS — NO POLITICS REQUIRED
We can’t wait for someone else to save America. Not politicians, as important as they are. Not business or community leaders, either. The real leaders in this country are you and me and all our fellow citizens. And while that may seem daunting, it’s empowering, too. Thefuture depends on you.
That future will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you believe that tomorrow is going to be worse, you’ll act accordingly. You’ll strive less andtry less. You’ll try to get more than you give because, after all, things are bad, so who cares?
But if you believe that tomorrow will be better, you’ll act very differently. Instead of sitting back, you’ll step up. Instead of accepting the problems around us, you’ll ask how you can solve them. You’ll never settle for the status quo — because you know you can chart a path forward.

The stakes couldn’t be higher. And if you don’t act, make no mistake: America’s drift may become a decline. But if you do act — if you apply the time-tested principles that define the best of our history — then America will find its direction again.
What are those principles? Belief in people. Free enterprise. The family. Accountability and human dignity. Every generation of Americans has applied these principles to overcome challenges and move past division. And that’s what we need to do today.
We have everything we need to move forward because we have you. Our people are still the most creative and entrepreneurial on Earth. Our economy is still the envy of the world. Hundreds of millions of people want to live in the land of the free and the home of the brave. And our country’s story is one of incredible progress, driven by everyday people taking everyday action.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/americas-smallest-cattle-herd-70-years-means-rebuilding-take-years-beef-prices-could-stay-high,America’s smallest cattle herd in 70 years means rebuilding will take years and beef prices could stay high,"Fifth-generation farmer Steve Lucie joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss President Donald Trump's call for the Department of Justice to investigate meatpacking companies over rising beef prices.
America’s ranchers are facing their smallest cattle herd in 70 years.
Years of punishing drought, rising costs and an aging ranching workforce have thinned herds across the country. Ranchers and agricultural economists alike say rebuilding will take years andbeef pricesaren’t likely to ease anytime soon.
""The biggest thing has been drought,"" said Eric Belasco, head of the agricultural economics department at Montana State University.
BEEF PRICES ARE CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS — BUT AMERICANS AREN’T CUTTING BACK
He said years of dry weather have wiped out grasslands across the West and Plains, leaving ranchers without enough feed or water to sustain their herds. Many have been forced to sell cattle early, even the cows needed to produce the next generation of calves, making it hard to rebuild.
""It’s not going to be a quick fix, you’re not going to solve it overnight,"" Belasco told Fox News Digital.

Belasco said the aftereffects of years of drought are still being felt and until ranchers can rebuild their herds, consumers will keep paying the price.
""The primary reason you see prices so high is because we haven’t seen any kind of inventory rebuilding,"" he said. ""Until you see that rebuild, you probably won’t see prices coming back down again.""
That slow rebuilding is a challenge for the cattle industry, according to Derrell Peel, a professor of agricultural economics at Oklahoma State University.
""The fact of the matter is there’s really nothing anybody can do to change this very quickly,"" Peel said. ""We’re in a tight supply situation that took several years to develop, and it’ll take several years to get out of it.""
Peel, who specializes in livestock marketing, said there’s no quick way to ease pressure on beef prices, since it takes roughly two years to bring animals to market and several years to rebuild herds.
TRUMP'S BEEF IMPORT PLAN IGNORES KEY ISSUE SQUEEZING AMERICAN CATTLE RANCHERS
Even as ranchers wait for herds to recover, parched conditions are working against them, turning pastures to dust and feed into a luxury.
Research from the Kansas City Federal Reserve found that with each step up in drought severity, cattle-producing regions see about a 12% drop in hay production, a 5% rise in hay prices, a 1% reduction in herd size and a 4% decrease in farm income.
To cope, many ranchers are shrinking their herds. A 2022 Farm Bureau survey found that about two in three ranchers have sold animals off, leaving them with roughly one-third fewer cattle than before.

Few people see the challenges of ranching more clearly than Cole Bolton, owner of K&C Cattle Company, whose pastures stretch along the soft edge of the Texas Hill Country.
""I think it's going to take a while to fix this crisis that we're in with the cattle shortage. My message to consumers is simple, folks, be patient. We've got to build back our herds,"" Bolton told Fox News Digital.
Bolton said the region, known for its red dirt and family-run ranches, has gone nearly three months without rain. While showers were finally arriving, he noted that the cattle industry has weathered one setback after another, from market turmoil to extreme conditions, over the past five years.
The growing strain highlights how persistent drought is reshaping the ranching industry and tightening the nation’s livestock supply.
That pressure is being felt not just on ranches but also at thegrocery store.
According to USDA data, the average retail price of beef rose from about $8.51 a pound in August 2024 to $9.85 a pound a year later, a gain of roughly 16%.
The ""5-market steer price"" represents what ranchers earn for live cattle before they’re processed into meat. The ""farm-to-retail"" spread reflects everything that happens after that – the costs and profits tied to slaughtering, processing, packaging, shipping and selling beef in stores.
Much of that work — and the profits it generates — are concentrated among the industry’s ""big four""meatpackers: Tyson Foods, JBS, Cargill and National Beef.
Together, these data points show that while ranchers are earning slightly more for their cattle than they were a few years ago, the biggestpriceincreases are happening well after the animals leave the pasture.
Despite the markups between the ranch and the grocery store, demand hasn’t wavered. Americans are still buying beef more than ever.

Beef remains the dominant player in the fresh-meat aisle, with $44.3 billion in sales over the past year, a 12% increase that outpaced chicken, pork and turkey, according to Beef Research, a contractor to the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association.

Glynn Tonsor, a professor of agricultural economics at Kansas State University, told Fox News Digital that strong consumer demand will continue to drivebeef priceshigher.
""There’s nothing that forces me or you or anybody else when we go into the grocery store to pay more for beef. People are choosing to,"" he said. ""The consumer desire for beef is strong and, regardless of the supply-side situation, that has the effect of pulling prices up.""

""Despite the massive amount of money being made by the United States of America, Hundreds of Billions of Dollars, as a direct result of Tariffs being charged to other countries, the full benefit of the Tariffs has not yet been calculated in that many of the buyers of goods and products, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs in the short term, ‘STOCK UP’ by purchasing far more inventory than they can use,"" Trump declared in a Monday morning Truth Social post.

Growing up on a cattle farm in Yell County, Arkansas, alongside many other generational farmers, I learned early on how price swings and economic uncertainty could affect a family business.
Unfortunately, thanks to former PresidentJoe Biden’s disastrous economic policies, farmers across America are faced with rising input costs, low commodity prices and high borrowing costs. There’s no doubt that it’s been a tough time for America’s farmers and ranchers, which is why I’m working to get them the assistance they need.
Earlier this year, I was proud to support the major farm bill reforms led by my fellow Arkansan and chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Republican Sen. John Boozman; this legislation was part of our Working Families Tax Cut. Unlike previous farm bills, which didn’t have nearly enough ""farm"" in them, the Working Families Tax Cut contained provisions to directly assist farmers and free up additional funding by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse.
Yet, these measures won’t kick in until 2026. Furthermore, many farmers have already booked this year’s crop, meaning they won’t benefit from any recent increases in commodity pricing.
FARMAGEDDON: TRUMP’S TRADE WAR AND SHUTDOWN ARE CRUSHING THE HEARTLAND

Here’s the bottom line: America’s farmers need help — now.
In myhome state of Arkansas, for instance, our farmers are set to lose hundreds of dollars per acre on their soybean, corn, cotton and long-grain rice crops this year alone. The situation has gotten so bad that Arkansas cash crop receipts are now projected to fall by $617 million in 2025.
Adding to these challenges for Arkansas farmers, the contrast between the steep cost of inputs (such as seed, fertilizer and diesel) and the commodity prices that farmers receive for their crops is at its highest level in 25 years. Put differently, input costs are too high and revenues are too low for many farmers to turn a profit, or at the very least, keep their businesses afloat. Unfortunately, the costs have caught up with too many Arkansas farmers; in the last year, among all southern region Chapter 12 bankruptcies (a classification specific to family farms and fishermen), one in four were filed in Arkansas.

America’s farmers also play a critical role in our consumer economy, which is essential to the security of our homeland. After all,food security is national security. Our adversaries would love nothing more than to see generations of farmers wiped out by economic hardship.
In recent months, soybean farmers have been unfairly targeted bycommunist China. This is particularly difficult for Arkansans, given that soybeans are grown in 41 of Arkansas’ 75 counties on thousands of farms across some 3.3 million acres in our state. While I welcome the announcement that communist China intends to purchase 12 million metric tons of soybeans this year — and 25 million metric tons every year for the next three years — we ought to keep in mind President Ronald Reagan’s old Cold War approach: trust, but verify.

I have spoken with PresidentDonald Trumpdirectly about the difficulties and hardships that farmers and ranchers in Arkansas and across America are facing. Without a doubt, Trump keeps them at the top of his mind and close to his heart. Now that the Schumer Shutdown has finally come to an end, we can get back to work providing relief to our farmers that will bridge the gap between now and when the Working Families Tax Cut provisions kick in next year.
Our farmers and ranchers must have the necessary assistance and support to get through to the next season. But just as importantly, they must be able to continue growing, harvesting and operating for generations to come.

Eastman, GA –A nationwideair traffic controller shortagehas put new attention on a growing training option the FAA now approves for certain colleges.
The recent federalgovernment shutdownhighlighted how thin staffing has become, especially as delays and reroutes stacked up across the country.
The FAA says it wants to hire at least 8,900 new controllers by 2028. According to FAA workforce data analyzed by USAFacts, about 3,000 controller positions were vacant nationwide as of late 2024 — though not every facility is equally understaffed.
That shortage is driving interest in a newer FAA-approved college pathway designed to streamline controller training at a small group of universities — including Middle Georgia State.

The Enhanced AT-CTI program allows students to train to the same standard as theFAA Academy, and if hired and meeting FAA requirements such as passing the Air Traffic Skills Assessment (ATSA), medical and security clearances, they can go directly to a facility instead of completing the full academy in Oklahoma City, which can involve long waitlists and multi-month courses.
Graduates still undergo facility-specific training and must be certified on-the-job before becoming full controllers.
Only about nine schools nationwide have been approved to offer the new Enhanced AT-CTI program as of 2025, according to Kemarie Jeffers, the department chair of aviation science and management at Middle Georgia State.
Inside Middle Georgia State’s tower simulator, air traffic control student Brooke Graffagnino says the job’s intensity is what drew her in. ""It kind of gets your chest beating, because with how much traffic there is,sometimes it is intense,"" she said.

She says students quickly find out whether they’re suited for the job. ""You can kind of tell who does not [love it]. There have been quite a few, and they are no longer here. It takes a lot to get through it,"" she said.
Graffagnino says the importance of the work became clearer as she learned how controllers keep busy airspace organized. ""Once you get in the airspace that is super crowded or approaching thelarger airports like Atlanta, you need someone to help coordinate and keep everything separate and safe,"" she said.
Middle Georgia State was approved as an Enhanced AT-CTI school in mid-2024. Jeffers says the impact was immediate.
""Before our program had maybe about 17 to 20 students. Right now we have 54. So we have already, in that short amount of time, almost tripled in size the amount of students that we have,"" he said.

To earn the enhanced designation, Jeffers said the school had to update its curriculum, overhaul parts of its simulator setup, and install new audio and video systems.
""We’ve upgraded a lot of our equipment… we had to install audio and video equipment upstairs in our tower sim,"" he said.
Those upgrades allow theFAA to remotely reviewor spot-check training sessions and ensure they meet federal standards.

The program’s biggest distinction is what happens after graduation. ""Enhanced CTI eliminates your requirement of going to the academy. You will graduate here and you can go straight to work,"" Jeffers said. ""So it saves you time and effort — again, it gets you to work sooner and making money quicker.""
The FAA requires enhanced programs to employ instructors with controller experience and maintain simulator equipment comparable to FAA standards.

As students advance, the simulations become more complex, requiring trainees to manage more aircraft at once.
""As we get more comfortable and confident, we are able to allow more aircraft into the airspace at a time,"" Graffagnino said.

Before finishing the program, every student must pass a final simulation that mirrors the FAA Academy’s evaluation process.
""Our instructors will then run a scenario and they will be graded… the exact same way in which they will be graded at the academy,"" Jeffers said.
According to the FAA’s FY 2025 Air Traffic Controller Workforce Plan, the agency anticipates about 2,000 hires in FY 2025, 2,200 in FY 2026, and incremental increases through 2028, though retirements are expected to offset much of that growth.

OK. The pumpkin season is officially over, and now it’s Christmastime.
Walk into any store in America right now, and you’ll think you’ve stepped into Santa’s workshop with peppermint everything, aisles of ornaments, pre-lit trees, inflatable snowmen and twinkling lights in your neighborhood that would make even Clark Griswold proud.
But try finding a simple Thanksgiving decoration. A turkey, a harvest wreath, even a grateful-themed tablecloth, and you practically need a search warrant. Somewhere between the discount Halloween candy and theBlack Fridaypromo aisle, Thanksgiving has vanished like a missing person.
And it’s not your imagination. Christmas is steamrolling Thanksgiving and there are three big cultural and economic reasons why.
Fox News Poll: Holiday togetherness tops political differences
Christmas shopping is taking over the Thanksgiving holiday. We can't let that happen.(iStock)
Let’s call this what it is: Thanksgiving just isn’t profitable enough.
Thanksgiving has stayed loyal to its old-school identity of food, family, gratitude, naps and football. It’s emotional but not commercial. You don’t buy matching pajamas for it. You don’t send greeting cards. Your kids don’t demand a gift haul.
Retailers hate that.
On the other hand, Christmas is a revenue machine:

Thanksgiving décor might bring in a couple billion dollars. Christmas? Try hundreds of billions of dollars.
Stores don’t even pretend anymore. The moment the last trick-or-treater grabs their fun-size Snickers, out come the reindeer and wreaths. Not because Americans wanted it but because stores can squeeze an extra six weeks of revenue out of your holiday spirit.
If you’ve wondered why you can buy a 12-foot inflatable nutcracker before you can find a turkey placemat, now you know.
If you want to measure the cultural shift in this country, don’t look at décor and just examine behavior.
Twenty years ago, Thanksgiving was sacred. Now? It’s basically the pregame show for Black Friday with some stores actually opening on Thanksgiving.
BOOK HOLIDAY FLIGHTS NOW OR PAY HUNDREDS MORE LATER, GOOGLE TRAVEL DATA REVEALS FOR 2025
Retailers have done a masterful job convincing Americans that holiday shopping is a holiday. Black Friday used to begin Friday morning. Then midnight. Then Thursday evening. Then Thursday afternoon.
At this point, the turkey isn’t even cold before people are scanning QR codes, checking store apps and comparing ""doorbusters"" that happen at 3 p.m.on Thanksgiving Day.
Thanksgiving slowly stopped being a national moment of pause and started becoming a national moment of spending. Gratitude is getting replaced with discount fear of missing out.  And when the holiday’s main purpose is eclipsed by sales, the culture follows. The decorations don’t stand a chance.
Thanksgiving décor might bring in a couple billion dollars. Christmas? Try hundreds of billions of dollars.
Thanksgiving is about reflection. Christmas is about escapism.
One demands we sit with what we have while the other invites us to cover life in lights, nostalgia, sugar cookies and some good old-fashioned instant gratification.
In a year where inflation is squeezing families, housing costs are outrageous and more than half of Americans say they’re living paycheck to paycheck, people are grabbing onto anything that brings comfort even if it means dragging out the Christmas bins before the pumpkins rot.
PUMPKIN OR APPLE? AMERICA’S FIERCEST THANKSGIVING DESSERT DEBATE HEATS UP
Christmas is warm, nostalgic and sparkly. Thanksgiving is quiet, reflective and slow, which are three things modern America has forgotten how to tolerate.

Some people will shrug and say, ""Who cares? It’s just decorations.""
But I think it’s deeper. Thanksgiving isn’t political. It’s purely American.
Thanksgiving is the one holiday uniquely designed to make us pause, reconnect and recalibrate. There are no gifts. No costumes. No commercial agenda. It’s a 24-hour reminder that what we already have is enough, which is something we desperately need in a world that constantly tells us we’re behind.
If we allow Thanksgiving to disappear and be replaced by 60 days of Christmas promos and artificial urgency, we will lose a holiday that strengthens the financial and emotional health of families.
A country that forgets how to be grateful eventually forgets how to be grounded.
Look, I love Christmastime. I’m not the Grinch. But we can enjoy Christmas without erasing Thanksgiving.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/carville-gives-dire-warning-future-presidents-embrace-populism-this-thing-could-break,Carville gives dire warning for future presidents to embrace populism or ‘this thing could break’,"Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville warned that the American dream has to change, noting that the standard of homeownership and a college degree for every American is no longer realistic as young Americans struggle economically.
Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville warned Thursday that any American president going forward must confront the affordability crisis facing young people.
""The thing that's coming in this country, and we're not ready for it, and that is the accumulation of generational wealth by our generation,"" Carville said on his ""Politics War Room"" podcast.
""It's just these stories that are coming out, and the young people have just … they're just having it terribly.They can't buy houses.They can't educate anybody. There was the CEO of Ford saying there's 5,000 auto mechanic jobs that they have that they can't fill.
""I think that this country made two bad bets,"" Carville added, ""And they both seemed like good bets at the time. One is we decided we're going to be a nation of homeowners. And, two, that we were going to be a nation of people that went to college. Both of those strategies are, in effect, blowing up in our faces.

""The next president is going to have to rethink this and is going to have to embrace some economic populism because I'm going to tell you, this thing could break. And if somebody doesn't get ahead of it, it's going to get ahead of everybody else,"" Carville said. ""And people are starting to get really pissed. They're starting to figure out what's happened to their lives.""
Carville is one of several commentators who have sounded the alarm on the issue, as many Democrats have been debating how toappeal to young male votersstruggling to enter the middle class in a changing, globalized economy.
In March 2024, months before President Donald Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election, Carville warned Democrats to abandon woke politics, arguing the party was dominated by""too many preachy females,""both of which, he said, were alienating male voters.

On Thursday, Carville said many younger Americans are ""starting to figure out why they don't have a lot of hope to get a good job or to be able to buy a house. Because, people, once we all bought houses, we put zoning restrictions and God knows what else just to drive the price of the asset up, which our price of our asset goes up, the price of what a young person has to pay goes up too.
""We’ve got to really rethink this whole idea of four-year college and homeownership.""

(Credit: Pool)
New York City mayor-electZohran Mamdaniis gearing up to meet PresidentDonald Trumpat the White House Friday — fulfilling a promise he made to voters during his election night victory speech that he would work with anyone if it would benefit his constituents.
While the president has been highly critical of Mamdani, he said Sunday he wants to see ""everything work out well for New York"" as both leaders zero in on a key issue for Americans: affordability.
Mamdani, who ran on policies including rent freezes and city-run grocery stores to cut food prices, has vowed to use his face-to-face meeting with Trump to make a ""case for New Yorkers"" who are struggling to pay $2.90 in bus fees.
As a result, Mamdani said that he had initiated the meeting with Trump ""because I will work with anyone tomake life more affordablefor the more than 8.5 million people who call the city home.""

ZOHRAN MAMDANI REVEALS WHAT HE PLANS TO DISCUSS WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP IN OVAL OFFICE MEETING
""I have many disagreements with the president, and I believe that we should be relentless and pursue all avenues and all meetings that could make our city affordable for every single New Yorker,"" Mamdani said at a press conference Thursday. ""I intend to make it clear to President Trump that I will work with him on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers. If an agenda hurts New Yorkers, I will also be the first to say something.""
Specifically, Mamdani pointed to poverty rates across the city. In February, Columbia University and anti-poverty group Robin Hood released a report that found that 25% of New York City residents — more than two million people — are living in poverty.
""I have to make the case to President Trump to the White House, as to what it means to have to suffer through this affordability crisis, and what it means to make it even more difficult to do so,"" Mamdani said.

Additionally, Mamdani said that he plans to address public safety and economic security with Trump as well.
The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on what the president would like to discuss with the mayor-elect.
However, Trump told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade that the two each want to ""make New York strong,"" and confessed that he was a bit tough on Mamdani during the election. He also predicted the meeting would be ""quite civil.""
Likewise, White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittsaid that it signaled Trump’s interest to ""do what’s right"" for the American public — regardless of political parties.
""It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that's who the Democrat Party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,"" Leavitt told reporters Thursday. ""I think it's very telling. But I also think it speaks to the fact that President Trump is willing to meet with anyone, and talk to anyone, and to try to do what's right on behalf of the American people, whether they live in blue states or red states.""
Although Trump has routinely characterized Mamdani as a ""communist,"" Mamdani has denied that is the case, and instead, said he is a democratic socialist.
Meanwhile, Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., told Fox News Digital Thursday that despite Trump and Mamdani's differences, the two are New Yorkers and that increases the odds of a better outcome following the face-to-face talk.
""I think that (Trump is) probably going to want to make it clear that in no way will the federal government support the implementation of a socialist or communist agenda in New York City,"" said Malliotakis, whose district includes Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, New York. ""But there's ways that we can work together as long as Mamdani plays ball when it comes to important issues like public safety, the deportation of violent criminals, transportation, infrastructure, public housing, hospitals — these are the things I'm going to be looking out for.""
Additionally, Malliotakis said that the two may have some common ground when it comes to affordability, and pointed to Trump's efforts instructing drug companies to lower prescription drug prices, or face consequences from the federal government.
""I think what President Trump is doing to lower prescription drug (costs) should be something that the mayor elect could embrace ... they both have a vested interest in affordability,"" Malliotakis said. ""However, Mamdani's policies simply don't work.""

https://www.foxnews.com/media/education-committee-demands-chicago-teachers-union-explain-missing-financial-audits-since-2020,Federal probe demands Chicago Teachers Union explain missing financial audits since 2020,"Fox News' Mike Tobin reports live from Chicago on a watchdog report revealing Chicago Public Schools spent over $7 million on excessive travel.
FIRST ON FOX –The Chicago Teachers Union (CTU) is under investigation by the House Education and Workforce Committee for allegedly failing to show how it has spent union members’ money over the past five years, according to a letter obtained by Fox News Digital.
The committee sent a letter to CTUPresident Stacy Davis Gatesstating that evidence suggests the union failed to provide members with complete financial audits since 2020.
""When unions flout these obligations, they betray the trust of the very people they are meant to serve … Every dollar paid by workers should serve their interests, not those of a select few operating in the shadows,"" the letter said.

Furthermore, the committee suggested that CTU’s conduct may justify strengthening federal reporting requirements, so members gain access to more timely, detailed financial information.
The letter further stated that, in light of CTU’s ""failures"" to provide full financial audits since 2019, the committee is examining whether reforms to the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) are needed to ""protect union members’ rights.""
""This failure to disclose financial information strips dues-paying members of their basic right to understand how their money is spent. The Committee intends to determine how this breakdown in transparency occurred, which will inform its potential reforms to the LMRDA,"" the committee wrote.
A full annual audit requires the financial secretary to furnish an audited report published in the union’s newsletter and the Board of Trustees to obtain an annual audit and make it available for members for inspection.
Because CTU is more than five years behind on publishing its full annual audits, in violation of its own bylaws, the committee cited reports that Davis Gates and other CTU leaders allegedly dismissed audit requests from members as racially motivated ""dog whistles.""

By Dec. 8, 2025, CTU must submit to the committee all unabridged audited financial reports from 2019 through 2024, meeting minutes or equivalent records since Sept. 9 when members requested audits and all written member requests for audits since Sept. 9, 2020, along with the union’s responses.
Labor unionsare required by law under the 1959 LMDRA to file annual reports with the secretary of Labor to ensure transparency, prevent abuses and maintain accountability.
Robert Bloch, general counsel for CTU, sent Fox News Digital the following statement.
""The letter from Mr. Walberg is based on deeply flawed and inaccurate assertions of dishonest actors.""
The committee’s letter follows a Nov. 12 inspector general report that found Chicago Public Schools (CPS) staff spent $7 million in COVID relief funds on luxury hotel stays, Las Vegas conferences and international trips. Other expenses included limousine rides and spa visits paid for by Chicago taxpayers.
PRELIMINARY DATA SHOWS CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS ENROLLMENT FALLS TO HISTORIC LOW: REPORT

""Affordability"" was the hot-button word on the 2025 campaign trail, as Democrats separated themselves from the Biden-era economy and lobbed attacks on PresidentDonald Trumpfor current cost of living woes.
And on Friday, the main champion of the ""affordability"" platform in the 2025 election cycle, socialist New York City Mayor-electZohran Mamdani, will travel to the White House for his first meeting with Trump.
The socialist candidate, who was relatively unknown until his primary defeat against former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, hammered home during his campaign that his policies would ease New Yorkers' notoriously high housing prices, cut food costs and bring down the cost of living overall — including by hiking taxes on the wealthy and corporations to bridge the financial gap.

""I know that for tens of thousands of New Yorkers, this meeting is between two very different candidates who they voted for, for the same reason,"" Mamdani said Thursday about his meeting with Trump. ""They wanted a leader who would take on the cost-of-living crisis. That makes it impossible for working people to afford living in this city.""
A winning economic strategy is nothing new to the president, however, considering his first administration and 2024 election platform focused on pulling the U.S. out of an economic hole. And Trump is making moves to lay claim over the word ""affordability"" while taking shots at the Biden administration's record on prices.
""The word is affordable and affordable. It should be our word, not theirs,"" Trump said Monday evening during McDonald’s Impact Summit 2025 in Washington. ""Because the Democrats got up in affordability, the front of it. And they don't say that they had the worst inflation in history, the highest energy prices in history. Everything was the worst. What? The great ad is lying. They say affordability. This stuff was all much more expensive.""
The White House told Fox News Digital Tuesday that Democrats don't have ""a leg to stand on"" with the economy following the Biden administration, which saw inflation spike to the highest levels in nearly 40 years, while arguing Trump has focused on real-life deals that translate to American jobs and lower costs since his first day back in office.
To the White House, Fox Digital learned, Democrats touting the word ""affordability"" is simultaneously an act of ""desperation"" following their 2024 losses, as well as ""meaningless"" as there's a ""difference between talking about a problem and then actually doing something about it.""
Fox News Digital took a look back at how ""affordability"" grew in prominence as a top campaign platform in 2025 among Democrats, and Trump's history of employing variations of the word ""affordable"" in his political efforts.
""Make America Affordable Again"" was touted at points by the 2024Trump campaign, while the president signed an executive order under his first administration related to ""affordable housing,"" and the White House celebrating in 2020 that Trump was improving ""the affordability and accessibility of life-saving prescription drugs.""
""We will target everything from car affordability to housing affordability to insurance costs to supply chain issues,"" Trump said from the campaign trail in North Carolina in 2024, The New York Times reported.

The president, however, has largely steered clear of the word ""affordability"" in his public remarks and social media posts, instead focusing his language around tariffs and paying off the national debt, increasing the U.S. job market, onshoring companies that moved overseas and hitting back at the inflation woes that spiraled under the Biden administration and continue to loom over the Trump economy.
The White House pointed to a bevy of deals Trump has made since his return to the Oval Office that underscore his focus on affordability for the American people: cutting regulations to unleash American energy to lower fuel and other costs, multiple deals to lower drug prices and attracting business to set up shop on U.S. soil to promote American jobs.
The White House said that it is in the midst of ""cleaning up"" the woes left behind by the Biden administration, with an official telling Fox News Digital: ""They got us in this mess in the first place.""
Voters casting ballots for Democrats in the name of affordability ""is like hiring the arsonists to put out the fire,"" Republican Kentucky Congressman and 2026 Senate candidate Andy Barr remarked to Fox News Digital.
""Complete Democrat control of Washington brought us the highest inflation in decades,"" he said. ""President Trump and Republicans already delivered the lowest gas prices in years, the largest tax cut in history, and will keep fighting to Make America Great Again.""
Just on Tuesday, the White House hosted Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, where he announced that Saudi Arabia was increasing its planned investment into the U.S. economy to nearly $1 trillion, up from $600 billion in May. The deal translates to Americans directly benefiting, with the White House pointing to GE Vernova, an energy equipment manufacturing company, as it celebrates the investment and its impact on American jobs.

David Broomwell, who oversees three GE Vernova factories, said during the Oval Office meeting Tuesday, ""If you look at the landscape for GE Vernova investment, over $750 million in the U.S. focused on true manufacture, bring jobs here stateside. We're looking at tripling the output of our Greenville, South Carolina facility where we make the gas turbines that are supporting U.S. needs as well as the Saudi Arabia needs. So real jobs, $300 million in gas investment, resulting in over 500 pieces of new equipment being installed in the Greenville, South Carolina facility. That translates into roughly 1,800 jobs across the board for GE Vernova.""
IT’S NOT JUST THE ECONOMY — THIS IS HOW DEMOCRATS BEAT THE GOP ACROSS THE COUNTRY
Just more than a year ago, economic anxiety under the Biden administration came to a vigorous boil and the election was thrown into a tailspin as the president dropped out of running for re-election and endorsed then-Vice PresidentKamala Harris.
Harris' campaign was viewed as carrying out a series of missteps that led to her loss, with the economy seen as one of the top areas of concern by both pundits and voters.

Voters during the 2024 federal election pointed to the economy as far and away their top issue. Americans flooded the polls a year ago with their wallets at the top of their minds, backing Trump on the ballot as the majority of voters reported they were concerned they could not afford food, healthcare, housing and gas for their car, previousFox News Voter Analysisdata showed.
Liberal political pundits lamented that the Democratic Party was weak on the economy, with even MSNBC's Joe Scarbourgh unleashing shortly after the election that voters ""were looking at what groceries cost, what gas costs, what rent costs"" while Democrats focused their campaign on deriding Trump for what they viewed as rhetoric that threatened democracy.
Then, a year later, Democrats pivoted to what would prove to be a winning strategy: affordability.
Each of the Democrats in the three high-profile elections — Virginia's gubernatorial election, New Jersey's gubernatorial election and New York City's mayoral election — prominently listed affordability as their top campaign issue. In fact, each campaign website boasts ""affordable"" or ""affordability"" on its homepage.
""New York is too expensive. Zohran will lower costs and make life easier,"" Mamdani's campaign website boasts, with an entire ""affordability"" platform dedicated to explaining his plan on city-run grocery stores to lower costs, eliminating bus fares and ""fighting corporate exploitation.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani's team for comment ahead of his meeting with Trump but did not immediately receive a reply.

ELECTION REFLECTION: 'DEMOCRATS FLIPPED THE SCRIPT' ON AFFORDABILITY IN BALLOT BOX SHOWDOWNS
A former Trump White House official and candidate for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, Morgan Murphy, told Fox News Digital that ""listening to Democrats on the economy makes as much sense as asking your drunk uncle for stock tips at Thanksgiving.""
""These are the same people who jacked inflation to 9%, tried to tank the U.S. economy by shutting down the government for 43 days, and just elected a full-blown communist to lead New York,"" Murphy said. ""They talk affordability but end up fleecing the American people. Americans are struggling economically from a hangover because of Bidenomics. It is important to grow the economy, re-shore manufacturing, grow ourenergy sector, and increase opportunity, which will decrease prices and make life more affordable.""
Earlier in November, Trump remarked that the Democrats had leaned into the ""new word"" while admonishingRepublicansfor not promoting similar platforms enough.

""They have this new word called affordability and (Republicans) don't talk about it enough,"" Trump said during an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier following the elections. ""The Democrats make it up because we took over a mess. Think of energy. Energy was so expensive, and now I have it down to half what it was.""
Mamdani and Trump are expected to have a fiery relationship upon the upcoming mayor's inauguration in January, with the White House's top spox Karoline Leavitt describing Mamdani as a ""communist"" who ascended to the top of the increasingly left-wing Democratic Party, while adding Trump's door is open to any U.S. leader.",11/21/2025
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/republicans-get-serious-housing-crisis-high-profile-conservative-influencer-leading-charge,Republicans get serious on housing crisis with high-profile conservative influencer leading the charge,"Fox New's Douglas Kennedy reports on the controversial proposal to develop federal lands across the U.S. as states like Utah face a housing crisis as costs double due to local zoning laws.
FIRST ON FOX:Conservative influencerBenny Johnsonis leading a new initiative to ""Make Housing Great Again"" amid concerns that Millennials and Gen Z are being pushed out of homeownership by rising costs, stagnant wages and regulatory burdens.
The new initiative, which is being announced Friday, will be led by the America First Policy Institute (AFPI) with help from Johnson, who will be the initiative's co-chair and national spokesperson, serving as the voice of the initiative. Johnson will help lead one of AFPI's advisory councils related to making housing more affordable as well, and he has tapped former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Ben Carson and developer Michael Burkentine as the initiative's first two board members.
""Benny has 4 million followers. He is, you know, so influential. He's been talking about this a lot on his own social media platforms, and so he is the perfect person to help deliver the policies,"" Ashley Hayek, AFPI’s executive vice president and co-chair of the initiative, told Fox News Digital. ""He has young children. I have young children. And for us, we are both very fired up about this issue.""
I WORKED WITH CHARLIE KIRK FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. AMERICA LOST A FUTURE PRESIDENT

Hayek pointed out that advocating for policy is, at least in part, a messaging war, and Johnson's ability to articulate himself well will help with that. Additionally, he has the attention of many young people, who Hayek noted often aren't aware of the tools out there to help them buy a home.
Greg Sindelar, AFPI's interim president, said that the current culture in the United States ""too often diminishes traditional aspirations,"" like homeownership and building a family, which has taken a toll on younger generations.
Even Democrats tend to agree. Former Democrat congressman and ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, wrote an op-ed in The Washington Post in August explaining how the increased difficulty of homeownership is depressing young men, particularly due to the fact that buying a home is often seen as such a pivotal part of achieving the American Dream.
""Rising costs, stagnant wages, regulatory burdens, and a culture that too often diminishes traditional aspirations have left millions feeling directionless and forgotten,"" Sindelar said. ""AFPI is committed to reversing this trend by advancing meaningful, actionable policy solutions rooted in the principles of the America First movement.""
BIPARTISAN PLAN AIMS TO MAKE THE AMERICAN DREAM AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR MILLIONS OF FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS
The new initiative, announced Friday, laid out a list of policy proposals it plans to advance across government of all levels.

Among those proposals is a push to eliminate capital gains taxes on first home sales as long as they reinvest in another home within the following five years. This proposal is aimed at mirroring the spirit of President Donald Trump's ""Opportunity Zones"" aimed at accelerating wealth and economic development for low-income communities.
""The average first-time homebuyer in America is now 40-years-old. 40. years. Old. That is far beyond the optimal age to get married and start a family,""  Johnson told Fox News Digital. ""The fight for homeownership is a fight for the survival of our culture and civilization. Young Americans cannot build families without homes, and a nation without families cannot survive. The American Dream is dying before our eyes. This is a generational betrayal, and we must reverse it for our children and for their future. This was the final policy priority of Charlie Kirk. We will deliver and save the American Dream.""
Another proposal includes a push for the creation of ""Home Savings Accounts"" similar to a Health Savings Account (HSA) that allows individuals to contribute pre-tax dollars to pay for their healthcare needs.
One proposal also includes a plan to reduce regulations and increase incentives across states and localities that have restricted the development of newhousing supply.One example they point to is ""green building standards,"" which the initiative says bloats costs for builders. By getting rid of these regulations, they say that it will dramatically reduce the cost for builders, who will then in turn be able to increase supply.

Other proposals include measures to stop predatory lending to young people, while promoting innovative housing like tiny homes.
Tax-focused proposals are in the mix as well, such as a ""Family Formation Mortgage Credit,"" aimed at making family formation and homeownership financially synergistic. It will give families that marry and have a child within five years a $10,000 reduction on their mortgage through a refundabletax credit.The initiative will also push to double the child-tax credit for households filing their taxes jointly and own a home, or are planning to own one.
""Home ownership is unlocking the American dream,"" Burkentine said. ""We need deregulation and implementation of meaningful policies to help young Americans reach this dream. I’m proud to partner with AFPI to make housing great again.""

The AI boom is defining our economy, and we’re now home to trillions of dollars in American AI innovation. America attracts 60% of global AI infrastructure investment and hosts the lion's share of cutting-edge models that will help solve problems for all Americans.

The growth of artificial intelligence is also the most significant force keeping oureconomy growing. One Harvard economist found that without data centers, GDP growth would have been just 0.1% in the first half of the year.
As Vanguard's chief economist recently noted, without this boom, ""we would have seen substantially weaker growth numbers."" AI infrastructure already supports more than 600,000 direct jobs — nearly 1.5 times the employment of our 16 automakers combined — and is anticipated to supercharge our economy for decades to come.
But advantage isn’t destiny. If we pause, China will sprint past us, and we’ll end up importing, not exporting, the technology of the future. In fact,a new report in The Wall Street Journalhighlighted how the AI race against China is as ""consequential"" as the Cold War because the technology has the ""potential to influence large swaths of the global population.""
AMERICA'S SECRET WEAPON TO CRUSH CHINA IN THE GLOBAL AI RACE
This is why we’re both proud to launch theAI Infrastructure Coalition(AIIC) to ensure that America finishes first.
The next five years will see $5 trillion inglobal AI infrastructure spending, yielding $15.7 trillion in economic value over the following decade. Victory in the AI race means millions of high-paying jobs, reshored manufacturing and technological exports that secure our prosperity. Defeat means ceding it all to China, which would become the unchallenged economic and military superpower.
China is closing the gapat breakneck speed. It holds nearly 75% of global AI patents and their models achieve 80% to 90% of U.S. capabilities at significantly lower costs. Chinese cloud providers plan 65% capital-expenditure hikes in 2025, backed by subsidies that make energy essentially free for their firms.
RAPID RISE OF AI PUTS NEW URGENCY ON CONGRESS TO UNLEASH AMERICAN ENERGY
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang warns bluntly: ""China is going to win the AI race"" unless we act. If Beijing dominates, it will control autonomous weapons, cyber warfare and global supply chains. American data — from health records to financial details — would flow through Chinese systems, exposing citizens to surveillance, manipulation and breaches.
As PresidentDonald Trumphas declared, AI breakthroughs could ""reshape the global balance of power."" Former President Joe Biden also agreed: ""We will not let America be outbuilt when it comes to the technology that will define the future."" They both understand that there is no scenario where allowing China to export the robots and models that power tomorrow's world ends well.

Instead of embracing the stakes of this AI race, many politicians and pundits are resorting to fearmongering about AI. Polling now shows that 83% of Chinese citizens see AI as beneficial, while just 39% are optimistic in the U.S.
THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY AUTONOMOUS TRUCKING
Unfortunately, as is typical, the prevailing narratives pushed in the press and on social media are often simplistic and inaccurate. We’re told that data centers are the reason many Americans are facing increased utility costs.Maine, with a negligiblenumber of data centers, saw the steepest year-over-year hikes; Virginia, home to the most, did not.
Goldman Sachs recently published an analysis of energy prices across the country and found that electricity price increases were most pronounced in states that retired reliable sources of energy and had onerous regulations. The firm noted that states with the least price inflation had ""robust local resource availability (coal/wind/gas)"" that ""helped keep electricity rates lower with ample supply.""

Water usage? Minimal and often recycled — less than America's golf courses. Job loss fears? Recycled doomsaying. Jeremy Rifkin's 1995 prophecy of internet-induced mass unemployment proved laughably wrong, and so will current dooming. The nature of theAI infrastructure stack, from energy companies to data centers to hyperscalers such as Google and Microsoft, means that the growth of the sector will require the hiring of systems engineers, electricians, facilities managers, and so forth. Google has already announced it will support an effort to train 100,000 new electrical workers.
As President Donald Trump has declared, AI breakthroughs could ""reshape the global balance of power.""
But if the United States is going to continue to be the leading AI nation, we needcommon-sense permitting reform. America needs to build out its energy infrastructure and semiconductor fabrication plants. Yet one in five AI projects dies in permitting hell, imperiling $64 billion in investments. Since early 2024, China added 429 gigawatts to its energy capacity; we managed to add 68 gigawatts.

Likewise,federal policymakersneed to address the confusing patchwork of AI laws across the nation with sensible legislation to preempt state laws. We need clear guardrails that protect people while enabling builders to build. The goal is simple: unleash American ingenuity, don’t immobilize it.
America can and must win the AI race. Let’s build the future here, power it with abundant energy, train our people to thrive in it and ensure that the dividends flow to the American people.

A nonprofit news organization that is funded entirelyby the U.S. governmentbegan selling off a large amount of its equipment on a public auction site – with many items being sold for pennies on the dollar.
Radio Free Asia (RFA) receives about $60 million a year from American taxpayers toproduce news in Asia.The organization said it was suspending operations due to a lapse in funding during the government shutdown.
But while its website went dark, Fox News discovered that RFA had quietly begun selling off major portions of its expensive broadcast gear, including HD cameras, teleprompters, lenses and even office refrigerators.
Listings on a public auction site, Rasmus Auctions, show RFA-branded broadcast gear is being offered at fire sale prices.

Some high-definition cameras are for sale for less than a dollar, teleprompters for 90 cents, professional lenses for under a dollar and a refrigerator listed for just 20 cents.
In total, more than a thousand pieces of equipment were offered for sale, which has sparked outrage.
California Congressman Darrell Issa, who had been working to restore RFA’s funding, called the online auction a betrayal to American taxpayers.

""I’ve never seen such belligerence by an organization that gets a hundred percent of its money from the U.S. government,"" Issa said. ""Lenses you’d pay thousands of dollars for are being sold for pennies. It’s clear they’re liquidating assets out of spite.""
When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Radio Free Asiablamed the Trump administration’searlier budget cuts.

They also pointed at the shutdown for forcing the organization to make difficult financial choices.
""The Administration’s unlawful termination and disruption of RFA’s timely funding, followed by an extended government shutdown, has forced the company to drastically reduce operational costs to set up for long-term success,"" the statement read.
""Shedding equipment we can no longer use, while retaining key personnel and assets, responsibly positions RFA to continue editorial operations that hold the Chinese Communist Party and other authoritarian governments to account,"" RFA said.

""Our plan going forward is to build back once Congress and the Administration resolve our funding issues,"" the statement concluded.
However,Kari Lake, deputy executive at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which oversees RFA, quickly disputed those claims.
""Everything they said was not true,"" Lake shot back.

Kari Lake vowed to get to the bottom of what is going on at RFA.
""We are funding them. We’ve given them every single penny appropriated to them. Eighty cents for an HD camera? That’s a slap in the face to taxpayers,"" Lake said.
In a letter to RFA sent Thursday, Lake wrote: ""The insanity ends now. Be prepared to open your doors next week for our team of auditors to find out what on earth is going on at RFA, as permitted under the grant agreement and applicable regulations.""

WithThanksgivinga week away, slightly more voters say they have a greater sense of gratitude this year, although the biggest share says they have just as much to be thankful for as last year.  Moreover, partisan barriers are unlikely to keep people apart as most say they are open to spending time with friends and family who hold different political views.
A new Fox News poll finds only one in five intend to steer clear of folks with opposing political views, while three-quarters are comfortable hanging out with the opposing team this season – the same proportion as in 2022, when the question was last asked.
While there is partisan consensus on spending time with relatives from across the aisle,Republicans(86%) are more likely than independents (71%) and Democrats (68%) to say they won’t avoid anyone.

It was the issue that boosted PresidentDonald Trumpand Republicans in the 2024 elections, as they won back the White House and Senate majority and kept control of the House.
But a year later, the economy, and everyday expenses in particular, are working against the president and his party.
Democrats, with an across-the-board focus on affordability, outperformed at the polls as they enjoyed sweeping success at the ballot box in the2025 electionsearlier this month.
And a new Fox News national poll released on Wednesday evening is another warning sign for Trump and the GOP.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS SAY WHITE HOUSE IS DOING MORE HARM THAN GOOD ON ECONOMY
Three-quarters of voters questioned in the survey, which was conducted Friday through Monday, viewedthe economynegatively, and large numbers of respondents, including Republicans, said their costs for groceries, utilities, healthcare  and housing have gone up this year.
The poll indicated that voters blame the president, with nearly twice as many pointing fingers at Trump than former PresidentJoe Biden, when asked who is responsible for the current economy.
Only 38% of those questioned gave the president a thumbs-up on how he's handling the economy. And Trump's overall approval rating, at 41%, is the lowest of his second term in office in Fox News polling.
SETTING THE STAGE: WHAT THE 2025 ELECTIONS SIGNAL FOR NEXT YEAR'S MIDTERM SHOWDOWNS
""The situation isn’t complicated,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""People are struggling to afford necessities and blaming those in charge. What’s interesting is watching Democrats gain politically from a problem they arguably caused — and that crushed them in 2024. But that’s politics.""
Trump enjoyed some positive economic news on Thursday, with the release of a stronger-than-expectedjobs reportafter several months of weakness.
U.S. employers added 119,000 jobs in September, according to federal government data delayed for weeks due to the government shutdown. But the report also indicated the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4%.
The Fox News survey is the latest national poll to point to political anxiety over the economy.
Jack Heath, the host of a popular statewide news-talk morning radio program inswing state New Hampshire, told Fox News Digital when he interviews congressional candidates and asks them what’s on the minds of voters they meet on the campaign trail, they tell him voters are ""talking about how they can’t afford anything. It’s affordability. It’s cost of living.""
""I think there’s a very short window to the midterms where the president needs to . . . get back to the blue-collar people who are working. They feel optimistic, but they’re growing more pessimistic that ‘I'm not keeping as much money as I want to and I’m working hard,'"" Heath, the host of ""Good Morning NH,"" said, as he referred to next year's midterm elections, when the GOP will defend its congressional majorities.

Trump, in his first post-2025 election interview, told Fox News' Bret Baier earlier this month that, on inflation, ""We've done so much. . . . Energy is way down. . . . We're going to have $2 gasoline. I did that. That brings everything else down. Groceries are way down, other than beef. Now, beef is going to come down . . . . The fact is, we have prices way down.""
And the president argued in his ""Special Report"" interview that it's more of a messaging problem for the GOP. ""As Republicans, you have to talk about it.""
But Trump and his team have turned the spotlight since the elections this month on battling high prices.
""We're making incredible strides to make America affordable again,"" Trump said Wednesday.
But the polls suggest Americans aren't buying the message from the White House.

The Trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would direct theJustice Departmentto sue states that enact their own laws regulating artificial intelligence, according to a draft reviewed by Fox News Digital.
The six-page document, titled, ""Eliminating State Law Obstruction of National AI Policy,"" is marked ""Deliberative / Predecisional / Draft,"" a label the government uses for internal working documents that have not been approved or made official.
Such markings indicate the text is part of policy discussions still underway and is exempt from public release under the Freedom of Information Act until a final decision is made.
The draft order reviewed by Fox News Digital details a broad, multiagency plan to centralizeAI regulationunder federal authority and anchor Washington’s control over the fast-moving technology sector.
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE DRIVES DEMAND FOR ELECTRIC GRID UPDATE
The Washington Post first reported the administration’s intent to direct the DOJ to sue states over AI laws.
A White House official, speaking on background, said any discussion of potential executive orders is speculative until one is officially announced.

If enacted, it would mark one of the strongest federal efforts yet to override state authority on technology regulation, potentially testing the limits of presidential power.
The order directs the Justice Department to create an AI Litigation Task Force within 30 days to challenge states that pass their own AI rules. It also directs the Commerce Department to review state AI laws within 90 days and allows the agency to withhold federal broadband and infrastructure funds from states that don’t comply.

It calls on the Federal Trade Commission and Federal Communications Commission to set nationwide rules for AI transparency, blocking states from enforcing their own, potentially stricter, versions.
The draft goes beyond what has been publicly reported, explicitly naming California and Colorado as examples of states whose ""fear-based""AI regulationsobstruct ""America's domination of this new frontier.""

It asserts that such state measures undermine U.S. dominance in AI. The Special Advisor for AI and Crypto is directed to develop legislative proposals to make the federal framework permanent.
The executive order follows a failed effort inCongressearlier this year to block all state AI regulation through a broader tax and immigration bill. That proposal collapsed after pushback from Senate Republicans who said oversight was needed to protect consumers and workers.

Concerns about AI’s impact on jobs, children and the energy grid have become central political issues across party lines. Meanwhile, Republicans have championed state sovereignty, making the proposal’s endorsement of federal authority a noteworthy departure.
The Trump administration has recently taken similar legal action against several states, including California, New York and Vermont,over climate and policing lawsthat the White House argues violate federal prerogatives.

Unhappy with theeconomy. Pain with prices. Unsure about Trump administration policies. It adds up to high disapproval among the president’s loyal constituencies.
Here are six takeaways from the latest Fox News national survey.
— Some 76% of voters view the economy negatively. That’s worse than the 67% who felt that way in July and the 70% who said the same at the end of former President Biden’s term.
— Large numbers, overall and among Republicans, say their costs for groceries, utilities, healthcare and housing have gone up this year.
FOX NEWS VOTER POLL – CHANGE CANDIDATE MAMDANI DEFEATS LEGACY POLITICAL FIGURES
— Voters blame the president. About twice as many say President Donald Trump, rather than Biden, is responsible for the current economy. And three times as many say Trump’s economic policies have hurt them (they said the same about Biden’s last year). Plus, approval of how Trump is handling the economy hit a new low, and disapproval of his overall job performance hit record highs among core supporters.
— After the government shutdown, the GOP and the Democratic Party have lower favorable ratings, and roughly 6 in 10 say the president and lawmakers on both sides don’t care about people like them.
— Voters think Republicans have a better plan for border security, immigration and crime, while Democrats are seen as better on affordability, wages, healthcare and climate.
— Views are divided on Trump’s peace deals making the world safer and the administration’s strategy for dealing with alleged drug-traffickers.
Here are the numbers behind those findings.
Trump’sjob performance drew career-high disapproval among men, White voters and those without a college degree.
Eighty-six percent of Republicans approve, down from 92% in March.
Among all voters, 41% approve of the job Trump is doing, while 58% disapprove. Only once have his ratings been lower and that was during his first term, 38-57% in October 2017. Two months ago, it was 46-54%.
For comparison,Biden’smarks were a bit better at the same point in his presidency: 44% approved and 54% disapproved in November 2021.
Forty percent of voters rate their personal finances as excellent/good, while 60% say only fair/poor, which is about where things stood a year ago. Ratings are notably bad (roughly 70% negative), among non-college voters, Hispanics, Blacks, independents and those under age 45. For those with household income below $50,000, fully 79% rate their finances negatively.

When it comes to the national economy versus personal finances, evaluations are also negative. Most say conditions are only fair/poor (76%), and fewer than one in five think inflation is completely/mostly under control (18%).
Compared to a year ago, voters say costs have increased for utilities (78%), healthcare (67%), housing (66%) and gasoline (54%). And 85% their grocery prices went up this year, including 60% who say costs increased ""a lot."" Majorities of Republicans agree with majorities of Democrats and independents that costs have gone up on each of these items except gas.
FOX NEWS VOTER POLL: CALIFORNIA VOTERS OK CONGRESSIONAL REDISTRICTING PLAN
At the end of Biden’s term, voters said by a wide 30-point margin that his economic policies had done more to hurt than help their families, driven by three-quarters of Republicans saying they had been harmed. The new survey shows almost identical results, as voters say by a 31-point margin that Trump’s economic policies have hurt rather than helped them, driven by the three-quarters of Democrats saying they have been harmed. In December 2018, during his first term, only 21% overall said they had been hurt by Trump’s policies, including just one-third of Democrats.
By a nearly 2-to-1 margin, voters say Trump is more responsible for the current economy than Biden (62% vs. 32%). Unsurprisingly, there’s a large partisan gap, as Democrats are nearly 40 percentage points more likely than Republicans to blame Trump. Somewhat surprisingly though, 42% of Republicans blame him, while a 53% majority says Biden is responsible. Among independents, 62% say Trump and 29% Biden.
A larger share believes the Republicans have a better plan for securing the border, dealing with illegal immigrants, reducing crime and reducing the federal budget deficit. Democrats are preferred for addressing climate change, reducing the cost of healthcare, raising wages and making things more affordable. The parties are about equal on the issue of job creation.
Congressional Democrats said the shutdown was about extending subsidies for Obamacare. The 2010 healthcare law remains popular, as 54% have a favorable opinion of it. Although much of that comes from nearly 9 in 10 Democrats viewing it positively. Not only do voters think Democrats have a better plan for reducing healthcare costs, but Trump received his lowest approval on the issue of healthcare.
""The situation isn’t complicated,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News Poll with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""People are struggling to afford necessities and blaming those in charge. What’s interesting is watching Democrats gain politically from a problem they arguably caused — and that crushed them in 2024. But that’s politics.""
While many families say thegovernment shutdowncaused them severe (10%) or moderate hardship (35%), more than half say it was not a hardship at all (54%).
The shutdown wasn’t a political winner for anyone. Nearly two-thirds disapprove of how Trump (62%), congressional Republicans (63%) and congressional Democrats (64%) handled it.
A record low 39% have a favorable view of the Democratic Party, down from 42% in July. Another 39% have positive views of the GOP, down from 44% this summer. For Trump, it’s 40% positive, down from 43% in September and 50% in January.
But it’s Senate Minority LeaderChuck Schumerwhose marks have deteriorated the most. A record low 22% view him favorably versus 54% unfavorably, for a net rating of minus-32 points. His ratings were underwater by 16 points in January. Among Democrats, positive views of Schumer went from 51% in January to 38% today.
The overall marks for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries took a smaller hit (from minus-2 to minus-10), as did Speaker of the House Mike Johnson’s (from minus-9 to minus-15) and Senate Majority Leader John Thune’s (from minus-10 to minus-12). Many are unable to evaluate Thune (54%), Jeffries (38%) and Johnson (31%).
Voters also think their political leaders don’t care about people like them, as roughly 6 in 10 say Democrats (59%) and Republicans (65%) in Congress and Trump (63%) don’t care.
Trump’s job ratings onforeign policyare underwater: 43% approve, while 55% disapprove. Yet views are more evenly divided on whether his recent peace deals will make the world safer or less safe (37% apiece), with one quarter saying not much difference. And 49% favor the U.S. military using deadly force against presumed drug trafficking boats departing from Venezuela, while 47% oppose those efforts.
The president receives his top marks on border security (53% approve). Nearly half approve of his handling of immigration (46%), while a new low approves on the economy (38%), and about one-third approve on tariffs (35%) and healthcare (34%).
Poll-pourri
The electorate believes the different branches of government are failing to live up to their constitutional obligations. Two-thirds are concerned about Congress (64%) and the Supreme Court (63%) not doing the checks and balances that they should and are giving too much of their constitutional authority to the president. At the same time, about half (47%) are concerned the judicial branch is obstructing Trump’s constitutional authority to carry out his agenda.

Asked how it would help a young couple buy their first home in his own home state, for example, Flood pointed out that ""increased demand"" for housing developers to meet strict existing codes for sewer systems, paved streets and stormwater systems has resulted in housing lot prices rising dramatically — particularly with recent years' high inflation.
LIZ PEEK: WHY EVERY 'AFFORDABLE' PROMISE FROM DEMOCRATS ENDS UP COSTING YOU MORE
Shifting those costs to the state and local governments, he said, would help lower those costs.
""The cost of a lot, before you even buy the ground, there's already $25,000 in there. If the city of Columbus, Nebraska, gets $2.5 million from the Home Partnership program, the city can go in and expand stormwater and sewer and maybe even pavement and streets,"" he explained.
""And suddenly, instead of being a $50,000 lot, it's a $20,000 lot. Instead of being a $300,000 home, you know, it's a $270,000 home because the cost of that was ultimately given to the city, and the city used it to build city infrastructure, not making the developer do that.""

Another focus was expandingwho can qualify forthe program, adjusted by the average income in a certain area.
TRUMP’S 50-YEAR MORTGAGE JUST INTRODUCES A NEW KIND OF DEBT
""The other thing we're really focused on is making sure that communities that have a median income, that average, aren't kicked out of the process simply because they want to put in affordable housing,"" he said. ""So we're taking the average median income standard from 80% of the county average to 100%, to make communities that have all the nice amenities able to participate in the program.""
Cleaver said in a statement on the legislation last month, ""By revamping and revitalizing the HOME Program—one of our greatest tools to expand the supply of affordable housing for working-class families—we can ensure that affordable housing and the American Dream of homeownership are once again attainable from the heartland to the coasts.""
Housing affordability has been a growing issue for some time, reaching a fever pitch just this year when theNational Association of Realtorsrevealed the median age for a first-time home buyer is now a record 40 years old.

First-time home buyers made up just 21% of home sales this year, the lowest number since 1981, according to the National Association of Realtors.

When speaking with Fox News Digital on Tuesday, Flood also credited PresidentDonald Trumpwith pushing the issue to the forefront of the national conversation.
""President Trumpaccelerated our success and our progress on this issue when he came out very forcefully earlier in the summer and said that housing affordability was one of the top goals of his administration,"" he said.

There’s a battle to define a narrative about what’s to blame for rising electricity prices. Some claim higher electricity prices are due to PresidentDonald Trump’s ""one big beautiful bill,"" which curtailed subsidies for ""cheap"" wind and solar installations. Others blame AI’s rapidly expanding appetite for electricity, while some blame inflation. None of these charges hold up under scrutiny.
But shifting blame, usually with the help of a complicit media, helps with the only thing that matters to most politicians: seizing political power.
This is readily seen in California Democrat Gov.Gavin Newsom’s trip to Belém, Brazil, to rub elbows with the global elite at the U.N.’s COP30 global climate conference on Nov. 11. Newsom, an all-but-declared candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 2028, slammed the Trump administration for not attending the confab, accusing the president of ""handing the future to China,"" presumably in the category of selling solar panels embedded with secret kill switches.
Newsom went on to say that ""We’re not turning backwards to the failed policies of the past —California is fighting for a clean-energy future, even as President Trump bends the knee to his Gulf-State patrons and takes a nap as the world burns."" Newsom also claimed that California is now operating its grid on ""two-thirds clean energy,"" with California operating on 100% non-fossil-fuel energy for at least part of the day nine out of 10 days this year.

But California now has thenation’s second-highest electricity prices, only behind Hawaii, with the Golden State’s electricity prices rising the most of any state since 2010: 127%, according to a new report from Jonathan A. Lesser, Ph.D., a senior fellow with the National Center for Energy Analytics.
The truth that Newsom doesn’t want Californians — or Democratic primary voters — to know is that ""green"" energy is expensive energy. That’s because, ""60% of the time, (wind and solar) works every time"" to borrow from the much-memed comedy ""Anchorman."" And, it’s very costly to make sure the power is on when wind and solar aren’t producing.
This, Lesser notes, is one of the main culprits in rising electricity costs.
LIZ PEEK: TRUMP WHITE HOUSE FIRED UP ABOUT KING COAL’S RETURN TO POWER
The Biden-Harris administration’sreckless push for subsidized wind and solar —and California’s before that and since — has destabilized our grid and forced consumers to foot the bill for fortifying unreliable ""green"" energy with reliable gas power and expensive batteries — the latter of limited utility.
From the first quarter of 2010 to the second quarter of 2025, average residential electricity rates across the U.S. surged by about 63%, according to Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. But the pain isn’t evenly distributed.States like Massachusettsand California not only endured the steepest hikes, but now boast two of the nation's highest rates — over 30 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases.
Critics peddle all sorts of excuses for these increases. One target is data centers, those power-hungry hubs fueling AI and cloud computing. Sure, they consume a lot of power — Virginia, a data center hotspot, has seen demand rise. But Virginia’s rates? Below-average increases and still under the national norm. If data centers are the villain, why isn’t the Old Dominion suffering like California?
TRUMP'S UN SPEECH REVEALS INCONVENIENT TRUTH OF MASSIVE GREEN ENERGY COSTS
A recent International Renewable Energy Agency report touts falling costs for renewables. But as Lesser’s analysis shows, that’s a half-truth at best. Subsidies like the federal production tax credit — now $27.50 per megawatt-hour — let wind and solar operators undercut the market with negative bids, distorting wholesale prices and squeezing out reliable baseload plants — which end up not being built.
Here’s the missing link the green advocates ignore: the shift in our generating mix. Between 2010 and 2024, U.S. electricity capacity grew 16% to 1,325 gigawatts, outpacing a mere 5% rise in retail sales. Sounds good, right? Wrong. Dispatchable sources — coal, gas and nuclear, which can ramp up on demand — plummeted by 80 gigawatts. Intermittent wind and solar ballooned seven-fold, to 278 gigawatts.

This trend accelerated in 2025: More than 1,900 megawatts of fossil fuel retired by July, with another 12,600 megawatts slated for shutdown by year’s end and into 2026. What's replacing them? Moresubsidized wind, solar, and pricey batteries.
TRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS
It’s policy malpractice. States like New Jersey and New York forcedpremature closures of reliable power plantssuch as Oyster Creek nuclear in 2018 and Indian Point in 2021, which powered a quarter of New York City’s needs.
Biden-era EPA rules, now being rolled back under Trump, would have shuttered most coal plants by 2032. Mandates for cars to have ""zero-emissions"" by 2035 in places like California ignore reality. Where will they get the electricity? Wind and solar can’t provide inertia or reactive power, essential for grid stability.

The fallout? Skyrocketing prices.
NEWSOM PUSHES CLIMATE RECORD ABROAD AS CALIFORNIANS SHOULDER AMERICA’S HIGHEST GAS COSTS
The truth that Newsom doesn’t want Californians — or Democratic primary voters — to know is that ""green"" energy is expensive energy.
Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act— only now going into effect, so any electricity price increases to this point aren’t due to the law — flips the script. By rescinding President Joe Biden’s vehicle emission standards and fossil fuel crackdowns, it prioritizes affordable, dispatchable energy. Expect more nuclear builds, streamlined pipelines and fewer handouts to Big Green. This won’t spike prices — it’ll stabilize them by restoring reliable supply.

Biden’s (and Newsom’s) green zealotry promised cheap power, but delivered the opposite: unaffordable, unreliable electricity that hampers economic growth. Trump’s reforms demonstrate that true energy independence means ditching the myths and embracing what works.
Americans deserve a grid that powers prosperity, not one that bankrupts it.

Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., raising the corporate tax rate in New York would be ""reckless.""
EXCLUSIVE:While Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman weighs a gubernatorial bid, Gov.Kathy Hochul, D-N.Y., is reportedly considering acorporate tax hike– a move the New York Republican described to Fox News Digital as a ""tax on the middle class.""
Blakeman said a decision about his political future is coming ""very soon"" as he travels across New York state to determine if he has the ""support to get to the next level.""
But as Blakeman mulls his political future, he is sounding the alarm on Hochul for reportedly planning toraise taxeson corporations to shore up funds for the state's budget gap and to deliver on Mayor-electZohran Mamdani's socialist campaign agenda,according to Politico.
""This is a tax on the middle class,"" Blakeman told Fox News Digital. ""It will make things less affordable. It will drive up inflation, and it will make New York less competitive. Corporations are already leaving our state in record numbers. Jobs are leaving our state. People are leaving our state. Thiscorporate tax increasewill drive more high net-worth individuals and corporations out of New York State and will be an economic disaster.""

Kyle Strober, executive director of the Association for a Better Long Island, the region's leading economic development advocacy organization, told Fox News Digital that a corporate tax increase could be ""potentially devastating"" to Long Island's economy.
STEFANIK DECRIES HOCHUL AS 'WORST GOVERNOR IN AMERICA' IN FIERY 2026 CAMPAIGN LAUNCH
""Long Island, whose economy is closely aligned withNew York City, is already confronting multiple challenges, including high taxes, high costs of living, and a lack of housing driving potential employees and employers outside the region,"" Strober said, adding that a corporate tax hike would ""only serve to drive away additional businesses and high-income earners, who pay the majority of the state’s tax revenue.""
""When this occurs, the tax burden is shifted to Long Island’s hard working middle class. It becomes self-evident that this tax proposal would fly in direct conflict of making New York more affordable for our middle class, a stated goal of Albany leadership,"" he explained.
The ABLI led efforts in 2021 and 2025 to opposetax hike proposalsout of Albany, particularly tax hikes on the top 1% of New Yorkers and raising the corporate tax rate.

Hochul has faced pressure from the socialist wing of the Democratic Party to raise taxes so Mamdani can deliver on his ambitious campaign promises, including fast and free buses, universal childcare and city-run grocery stores.
Mamdani campaigned onraising taxes on the top 1%of New Yorkers and hiking up the state's corporate tax from 7.25% to 11.5% to match the rate in New Jersey. Any tax hikes would require Hochul's approval in Albany.
MAMDANI LAUGHS OFF CRITICISM THAT HIS TAX HIKE PROPOSALS WILL COMPEL NEW YORKERS TO FLEE
While the comparably moderate governor endorsed Mamdani after he secured the Democratic nomination, Hochul has maintained that she won't raise taxes on the top 1% of New Yorkers – despite Mamdani's supporters heckling Hochul to ""Tax the rich!""
""This has become a one-party state ruled by the far-left, woke,progressive part of the Democratic Party, now led by Zohran Mamdani, the mayor-elect of New York City, who is an avowed social democrat,"" Blakeman said, charging that Mamdani sounds like a ""communist.""
""He is anti-American values,"" Blakeman said. ""He is against business. He will destroy the economy of the greatest financial city in the world, the financial capital of the world: New York City. And that will have a material effect on my county, which borders New York City.""

Blakeman said Hochul raising taxes on corporations would be a ""disaster."" And when asked how the state should approach Mamdani following his election night success, Blakeman said Republican leadership needs to step up and ""push back"" in New York state.
""When he wants to do crazy things, like give free bus rides to everybody, which will be nothing more than homeless shelters on wheels, when he doesn't want to prosecute criminals for committing crimes, when he wants to increase taxes and increase the corporate tax rate, and he wants the tax the rich, which will drive people out of New York State, and they'll take jobs with them, we have to push back.""
AS NYC ELECTS SOCIALIST MAMDANI, NEIGHBORING COUNTY DOUBLES DOWN ON TRUMP-STYLE LEADERSHIP WITH BLAKEMAN’S WIN
While New York City handed power to its far-left flank on Election Day, neighboring Nassau County re-elected Blakeman, an ally of President Donald Trump.
""I won because I adhered to American values, American principles. I didn't raise taxes a penny in four years. I hired 600 new law enforcement professionals. I declared Nassau County wasn't a sanctuary county. I showed leadership and I reached out to communities that in the past, the Republican Party has ignored,"" Blakeman said, explaining how he built a broad coalition of support among diverse communities.

When reached for comment, Hochul campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika told Fox News Digital that the governor has ""cut middle class taxes while puttinginflation refund checksin New Yorkers’ pockets.""
""Bruce Blakeman is the number one fanboy for Trump’s tariffs that are raising costs for families and making everything more expensive for small businesses – while the governor remains laser-focused on lowering costs, Blakeman’s shilling for Donald Trump’s tariff tax hikes,"" Chitika charged.

Since winning his re-election earlier this month, Blakeman said business and political leaders have encouraged him to launch a campaign for governor, given his executive experience.
But while rumors swirl about Blakeman's political future,Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., another Trump loyalist, has already launched hergubernatorial campaignand secured support from New York Republican Party Chair Ed Cox and 36 New York conservative county chairs.

PresidentDonald Trumpsaid Monday that Americans could see payment checks funded by tariff revenues as soon as next year, promising that ""hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff money"" would be distributed as dividends by mid-2026.
""We've taken in hundreds of millions of dollars in tariff money. We're going to be issuing dividends probably by the middle of next year, maybe a little bit later than that,"" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.
The president first floated the idea last week, saying he would use tariff revenueto send $2,000 paymentsto low- and middle-income Americans, with any remaining funds directed toward paying down the nation’s soaring debt.

With the nation’s debt hovering just north of$38 trillion, revenue from tariffs amount to little more than a rounding error: billions collected against trillions owed.
The proposal comes at a pivotal moment, with tariff receipts climbing and the Supreme Court reviewing the legality of Trump’s trade measures.
Since Trump announced his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs in April, tariff revenues have climbed sharply from $23.9 billion in May to $28 billion in June and $29 billion in July.
Total duty revenue reached $215.2 billion in fiscal year 2025, which ended Sept. 30, according to theTreasury Department’s Customs and Certain Excise Taxes report.

So far in fiscal year 2026, which began on Oct. 1, the U.S. has collected $37.5 billion, according to the latest numbers published by the Treasury Department.
And while tariff collections have soared under Trump, they remain a modest contributor to federal coffers.

FIRST ON FOX: EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will announce Monday a revamp of the widely criticized Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule – a regulation that, in one case, left an Idaho couple facing potential fines of $33,000 per day for building a home on ""soggy"" ground.
WOTUS was drafted during the Nixon administration under the Clean Water Act to regulate and protect wetlands, more broadly define ""navigable waters"" and protect public health, before the Obama and Biden administrations extended its reach to where landowners feared the EPA could swoop in at any moment and usurp control of their lands.
""When it comes to the definition of ‘waters of the United States,’ EPA has an important responsibility to protect water resources while setting clear and practical rules of the road that accelerate economic growth and opportunity,"" Zeldin said in a statement.

The Obama administration greatly broadened WOTUS’ definitions, before the Trump administration relented some of those new regulations – to which theBiden administration again greatly expandedfederal jurisdiction over areas of land that could include ephemeral streams, and low-lying spots prone to naturally-collecting water that could be found to have a ""significant nexus"" to navigable water.
The EPA said Monday that the new rule, drawing on a court decision in favor of exasperated landowners, is delivering on anotherTrump administration promiseto provide regulatory clarity while also protecting America’s waterways.
The rule, crafted in concert with Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works Adam Telle, will provide long-term economic relief for farmers and ranchers who spent years wondering whether a simple ""puddle [could] trigger federal permits"" and energy producers fearing ""regulatory quicksand.""
EPA URGED TO AXE FUNDS FOR ‘RADICAL’ CLIMATE PROJECT ACCUSED OF TRAINING JUDGES, STATE AGS RALLY
The EPA said Americans joined nine ""listening sessions"" and collectively stated the same thing – that WOTUS needs clear, commonsense parameters that balance environmental stewardship with the ability to farm, ranch, homestead and speculate energy.
The rule will define regulatory terms like ""relatively permanent"" (in the case of waterways), ""tributary"" and align the scope of the rule with the original Nixon-era intent.

In order for a tiny tributary to be considered within the feds’ jurisdiction, it must have a consistent flow through to navigable waters – and wetlands under the auspices of the EPA must be ones that hold surface water for a required period annually.
The rule includes new exclusions for groundwater and runoff, land that was previously covered by crops – and efforts to promote therights of state and tribal governmentsas well as local township leaders to make permitting decisions in areas they know best.
""Democrat administrations have weaponized the definition of navigable waters to seize more power from American farmers, landowners, entrepreneurs, and families,"" Zeldin said.
TRUMP EPA PUTTING BLACK AMERICANS BACK IN THE DRIVER’S SEAT
""We heard from Americans across the country who want clean water and a clear rule. No longer should America’s landowners be forced to spend precious money hiring an attorney or consultant just to tell them whether a Water of the United States is on their property.""
Farmers, homesteaders and energy producers warned that the earlier, broader definition gave the EPA sweeping authority to declare even a puddle or drainage culvert under federal control, rather than local oversight.
The situation came to a head when Michael Sackett and his wife Chantell successfully filed for the required local building permits to construct a ""modest"" home near Priest Lake, a touristy spot inIdaho’s panhandle.

Once the construction crew began spreading gravel on what was described as a ""soggy"" parcel in proximity to other homes, the Obama EPA swooped in and threatened them with nearly $33,000 per day in fines for continuing their project, accordingto Bloomberg– or face potential six-figure costs to file the proper permits, which reports said the agency itself suggested would ultimately be denied, according to multiple reports.
The Sacketts sued, and the case ultimately resulted in a unanimousSupreme Court decision in their favorin 2023.

""[O]nly those wetlands and waters that have a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the United States in their own right,"" the justices wrote.
The decision led the Biden administration to narrow its own writing of the rule to align withthe court’s edict– which the Trump administration pared down and clarified further with this announcement.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., ripped the decision, saying the ""MAGA Supreme Court is continuing to erode our country's environmental laws.""
""Make no mistake – this ruling will mean more polluted water, and more destruction of wetlands,"" Schumer said.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-losing-ai-because-big-messaging-problem,Democrats are losing AI because of a big messaging problem,"Conservative Gen Z influencers Xaviaer DuRousseau and Isabel Brown join 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the impact that AI is having on Gen Z's job market, and how those who are embracing it are being rewarded.
Democrats in Washington are losing the AI conversation. Not because they are wrong about AI's risks, but because they have failed to offer Americans a vision for the economic transformation ahead. While they focus on managing problems, others are defining what comes next. One side is talking about building the future, the other about constraining it.
In November, at Nvidia's GTC conference in Washington, hundreds of technologists and business leaders celebrated a great American success story: Jensen Huang and the company he co-founded.  The speakers praised PresidentDonald Trumpfor his administration's approach to AI. Many in the audience saw an administration that's for removing barriers, enabling scale and improving American competitiveness.
This should be a wake-up call for Democrats, who have failed to seize the opportunity so far to speak not only to AI's risks, but to its potential for broad economic transformation.Democrats haveasked plenty of questions about AI’s safety, its biases and its effect on the job market.
But so far, Democrats have treated these as separate problems to manage rather than as pieces of a larger question: how do we shape this transformation so it creates opportunity for everyone, not just profits for a few? That's the conversation Americans deserve.
THE NEW ARMS RACE IS FOR COMPUTE — AND AMERICA CAN’T AFFORD TO FALL BEHIND
D.C. Democrats need to reclaim the issue of AI from Republicans.(iStock)
Theelite consensus in Washingtonfocuses on one goal: optimize America's AI capabilities as a whole. A recent Foreign Affairs essay by former Biden administration officials captures the ""grand bargain"" between government and industry: more infrastructure and capacity for big companies. Workers, communities and startups beyond the frontier are afterthoughts. Build first, assume prosperity trickles down later. It's a familiar strategy that hasn't delivered before. Republicans mostly embrace this framework as well, but Republican populists smartly recognize its shortcomings.
What this means going forward: Large companies positioned to capture trillions. Worker displacement a problem to solve later. Communities provide land, energy, and water without guarantees they'll share in prosperity. The Biden administration's 2023 executive order was comprehensive on safety testing but said little about prosperity, workers or communities.
Past waves of automation left communities hollowed out and workers without pathways forward. Innovation rarely distributes opportunity without deliberate efforts to strengthen workers, communities and local economies.
Recent polling in swing states shows AI sentiment declining as workers connect the technology to job insecurity. We all lose. Not to China, but to ourselves. The skepticism crosses ideological lines. On the far right, former Trump chief strategist Steve Bannon warned earlier this year that entry-level jobs will be destroyed. On the far left, Democratic Socialists see AI as another vehicle for corporate power. Both responses cede the possibility that AI could distribute opportunity rather than concentrate wealth.
TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA
An alternative vision would optimize for the flourishing of American Davids: our workers, families and innovative startups. Large companies' long-term success depends on this foundation too. It's not about slowing down. The capital is moving fast regardless. The question is whether we structure that rapid deployment to create broadly shared prosperity or concentrated extraction. Aimless speed creates the political backlash that actually threatens progress. Speed with a plan creates sustainable advancement.
We've done this before. Land grant universities gave communities stakes in research and education. Rural electrification co-ops gave farmers ownership, not just access. The GI Bill gave veterans leverage to build fulfilling careers, not just short-term compensation.Alaska's Permanent Fundgives every resident dividends from oil extraction on public lands.

Now imagine: National block grants enabling states to createpublic compute for startupsand regional economies. Worker transition funds that workers control, not programs they endure. Equity stakes when companies profit from public infrastructure give communities ownership of their future. Third party assurance markets to accelerate responsible innovation at scale. These are ideas to prompt discussion with the American people. This moment calls for a national project worthy of American ingenuity.
Democrats have a long history with this thinking. Rural electrification and railroad policy ensured broad access. Today, Arizona Democratic Sen.Mark Kelly's ""AI for America"" proposal represents the kind of bigger vision we should debate.
Democrats have an opportunity now to pursue an alternative path and offer our country a national project that centers AI advances as the critical innovation for a prosperous, healthy, and safe future for all Americans.
Aimless speed creates the political backlash that actually threatens progress. Speed with a plan creates sustainable advancement.New technologyalone is good. But it's even better when paired with policy and market approaches that emphasize economic security, opportunity and dignity for the American people.

Democrats are flat-footed. Anxiety is rising among populists on the right and left. The urgent question now is whether either party will challenge the elite consensus that treats the impacts of economic transformation on workers, communities and startups as either imaginary or problems to solve later.
This moment demands a vision that accounts for all Americans, our workers, communities and startup entrepreneurs most especially.

Thomas Worthy, another Lawndale resident, said he received a bill in mid-November that was $977 more than what he paid last year.
""The tax increase is tied to a TIF that I have no idea why,"" Worthy said. ""It's collecting money from our neighbors and our streets, but we're not being notified for why it's in the bill.""

CHICAGO MAYOR SAYS APPLICANTS FOR FLOOD RELIEF NEED NOT REVEAL IF THEY’RE IN THE US ILLEGALLY
The Illinois Policy Institute, a nonpartisan research organization,found more than halfof a Chicago homeowners’ property tax bill goes to Chicago Public Schools.
""Illinoisans pay the second-highest property tax rate in the U.S., shelling out about 2.07% of their property’s value each year. That’s more than double the national rate,"" the organization noted. ""It’s even worse in Cook and the collar counties. Cook County in 2022 ranked among the nation’s 100 most expensive for property taxes, with property taxpayers spending more than the typical homeowners in California’s Orange County, Los Angeles County or San Diego County.""
Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnsonis facing pushback from City Council members over his proposal to extract a record $1 billion from TIF districts to balance his $16 billion 2026 budget,The Chicago Tribune reportedin late October.
The proposal would draw funds from 68 of the city’s 108 TIF districts, including several on the South and West Sides, raising concerns among aldermen about potential delays in long-promised neighborhood improvements.

EXCLUSIVE –Chip Carter helped launch the 39th annual Habitat for Humanity Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project in October, praising his late father for his bipartisan efforts to build homes.
The Carter Work Project is a weeklong event the Carters created in 1984. Over the years, they worked alongside more than 100,000 volunteers to build, renovate and repair nearly 4,400 homes, according to Habitat for Humanity.
Chip said building homes appealed to his parents because it was a wholly apolitical pastime.
""You know, Mom and Dad spent so much time here at Habitat and working on these things and giving of themselves and I think one of the reasons he really liked it is because it's totally not political,"" Carter toldFox News Digital. ""You don't know whether the man or woman that's using the hammer beside you is a Democrat or a Republican and you never talk politics. I think they really enjoyed that week away from it that they got to spend every year.""

""Certainly for us, we think every Habitat build is special, but the Carter Project is really our signature event every year, where, not only do we get to build homes here in Austin, which is wonderful, but it's a time to bring attention nationally to the huge need for affordable housing all across the U.S. And across the world,"" Habitat for Humanity CEO Jonathan Reckford similarly told Fox Digital. ""So it's a joyful week.""
Carter said his dad's bipartisan efforts weren't just on display during construction projects.
""I think he was certainly not pretentious at all,"" Carter said of his dad. ""He didn't change much during the process. He had his facts and his beliefs, and he tried to do whatever he thought was correct, without worrying about getting re-elected. And obviously, he didn't. But, it's a way to give. This week, for me, when I show up on Monday, I'll get sore. When I go through by Friday, I won't be. And on Friday, we give the key away to a house. And so there'd be homeowners there that are just so excited that never would have had a chance for a home. And I had spent a week giving of myself.""
""You know, on Fridays I pat myself on the back,"" he continued. ""I feel as good about me for doing this then as I do feel about me the whole rest of the year. So this is one of my favorite weeks. I'll continue to come back. This time I brought my daughter and her husband so that when I get older — if dad was here he'd say 92 would be a good age — but when I get older that my daughter and her husband can take over and still have a Carterpresence on this and help carry on the legacy.""

Rosalynn Carter died at age 96 in 2023 and Jimmy Carter died last year at the age of 100. All five living men who once occupied the White House — then-President Joe Biden and former presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush,Barack Obamaand then-President-elect Donald Trump — came together for the funeral at the Washington National Cathedral on Jan. 9, 2025.
Trump and Obama sat next to each other for the service, and it was theirsmiling, animated exchange, in particular, that drew the most attention. Their interaction sparked viral memes and parody videos, with lip readers trying to guess what the two men were talking about. Their chummy conversation even prompted some figures like Clay Travis, founder of sports and politics commentary platform OutKick, to joke, ""Did Obama vote for Trump too?""
Trump was asked about the viral moment ahead of hisinauguration, remarking that he ""didn't realize how friendly it looked.""
""You know — I'm sorry my father died, but the funeral was fantastic,"" Carter said. ""It was, it was non-political almost, and we had a lot of Republicans saying wonderful things about my parents and my parents deserved that because they helped people their whole lives, and it made me feel good to be an American again. And, of course, it was difficult to spend 11 days — to have an 11-day funeral. But, it was inspiring to me and to my family, I know, and we just appreciate the outpouring of love that we've received from America and across the world.""

New York Mayor-electZohran Mamdaniencouraged his more than 1 million X followers this week to boycott Starbucks.

""While workers are on strike, I won’t be buying any Starbucks, and I’m asking you to join us. Together, we can send a powerful message: No contract, no coffee.""
On the same day, Starbucks Workers United, a union representing workers at the coffee giant, announced it was going on an open-ended strike in what is being dubbed the ""Red Cup Rebellion.""

Red Cup Day is typically one of the company’s busiest days.
She further pushed back against the union narrative:
""We’re disappointed that Workers United, who represents less than 4% of our partners, has called for a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table. Less than 1% of our coffeehouses are experiencing any level of disruption and the vast majority of our 240,000 partners came to work ready to serve customers and celebrate Reuseable Red Cup Day.
We’ve been very clear - when the union is ready to come back to the bargaining table, we’re ready to talk. The facts show people like working at Starbucks. Partner engagement is up, turnover is nearly half the industry average, and we get more than 1 million job applications a year.
Any agreement needs to reflect the reality that Starbucks offers the best job in retail, including more than $30 an hour on average in pay and benefits for hourly partners.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-gen-z-suddenly-skipping-15-burrito-bowl,Why Gen Z is suddenly skipping the $15 burrito bowl,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on the White House’s focus on affordability post-government shutdown, Vance tying high prices to high rates of illegal immigrants on 'Special Report.'
If you’ve noticed that your local Chipotle or CAVA feel a little quieter during lunch hour, you’re not imagining it. Gen Z has literally stuck a fork intocasual diningand picked up grocery bags instead.
Chipotle’s CEO Scott Boatwright recently said younger diners, especially those between 25 and 35, are ""facing several headwinds"" and simply aren’t eating out as often. The translation: Generation Z is going broke and they know it. The $15 burrito bowl has become a symbol of a generation that’s tightening its belt as the mounting pressure of grocery prices, student loan repayments, and spiraling credit card debt run out of control.
Fast casual dining out was once considered an affordable convenience and has now become a small luxury. Boatwright said bluntly that Chipotle isn’t losing younger customers to competitors; it’s losing them to grocery stores and food at home. Think about that. The same people who fueled the fast-casual boom are now saying, ""I’ll just cook instead.""
'NOBODY'S SPENDING $17 ON AN EGG SANDWICH': RESTAURANT OWNERS SAY INFLATION FORCING TOUGH MENU CHOICES
At CAVA, CEO Brett Schulman sees the same pattern. He admits younger guests are ""making more deliberate choices"" about spending. Even though CAVA bowls average $11 to $13 most of the time, that still feels like a splurge. Your bank account balance is less than 30 days away from hitting zero. Schulman calls today’s economy a ""fog"" and in that fog,fast casual restauranttraffic is disappearing.
In 2025, the same people who once fueled the fast-casual boom are now deciding to cook at home instead.(iStock)
This generation isn’t lazy or spoiled. They’re financially boxed in right now.Student loan paymentshave resumed for millions of borrowers, with more than 50% of people having not made a repayment.Credit card debt just hit record highsat more than $1.2 trillion. Auto loans now stretch seven or even eight years for many younger buyers. And while rent and grocery prices soar, real wage growth has stalled.
This is what ""voting with your wallet"" looks like in 2025. We just saw this with the mayoral election in New York City. And you will see this become the number one issue in the 2026 midterms.
FREE MEAL IS MOTIVATING NEARLY 1 IN 3 SINGLES TO SAY 'YES' TO DATE, NEW REPORT FINDS
In the past,younger consumers led the charge in dining trendsby paying more for organic, sustainable or fast-casual meals that felt upscale but affordable. Now those same consumers are financially maxed out. Even though many are making decent incomes, the real after-tax wages simply aren’t keeping up with thedebt and overall inflation.
This isn’t just about burrito bowls or Mediterranean grain bowls. It’s a signal that consumer behavior is changing across the country and this trend is going to continue given the larger picture of sustainable housing affordability. Younger Americans are voting with their wallets, and they’re saying: we’re done paying $20 for lunch.
Gen Z isn’t anti-burrito. They’re giving up dining out, and they're reacting to a generation's broken financial equation. With inflation eating away at their paychecks and debt stacking up, all types of small luxuries are getting cut.(iStock)
Fast casual dining chains built their success on speed, quality, and a perceived value gap between fast-food and full-service restaurants. But that middle ground is now under siege and people are returning to dollar-value menus at fast-food restaurants anddiscount grocery stores like Aldi.
AMERICA'S PIZZA BOOM GOES COLD AS DELIVERY APPS TAKE BIGGER SLICE OF THE PIE
Currently,value focused chains like McDonald’s, Chili’s, and Domino’sare gaining share. When inflation bites, people trade down. They still want convenience without paying the premium price tag. The same $12-to-$15 spent on a fully loaded bowl can cover two homemade dinners or a week’s worth of frozen meals.
For anyonerunning or buying a restaurant, your customer base is shifting. The 25- to-35-year-old demographic, once the lifeblood of fast-casual dining, is disappearing faster than guacamole on a Friday night.
(For anyone running or buying a restaurant, your customer base is shifting. The 25- to-35-year-old demographic, once the lifeblood of fast-casual dining, is disappearing faster than guacamole on a Friday night.)
If your concept relies heavily on younger diners, it’s time to rethink pricing, promotions and loyalty. People still love good food, but they’re searching for value. Boatwright has already said Chipotle won’t chase customers by cutting prices. That’s admirable, but it’s risky and stocks like CAVA and Chipotle could feel significant pain. Holding the line on price when consumers feel squeezed could hurt traffic much more than you think.
GEN Z DRINKERS LEAVE BARTENDERS FRUSTRATED WITH SHRINKING TIPS AS 'TERRIBLE' TREND EMERGES
From a valuation standpoint, buyers are looking harder at guest demographics, frequency trends and economic resilience. A restaurant that relies on young professionals may see its valuation dip unless it can prove stability in a downturn.
Gen Z isn’t anti-burrito. They’ve woken up to realize that it’s not worth the mental and financial stress clawing their way out of debt. They’re giving up dining, and they're reacting to a generation's broken financial equation. With inflation eating away at their paychecks and debt stacking up, all types of small luxuries are getting cut.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-ms-now-whats-behind-networks-branding-makeover,MSNBC to MS NOW: What's behind the network's branding makeover?,"MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" reacted to the networks upcoming name change, ""My Source News Opinion World,"" or MS NOW, on Monday.
Saturday will mark the end of an era for MSNBC as the liberal cable network moves forward under new ownership and a new name:MS NOW.
The media shakeup was nearly a year in the making after Comcast announced it would spin off its cable networks into its own company called Versant, separating MSNBC from its sister broadcast network NBC, which will remain under the NBCUniversal umbrella.
The looming split led to many burning questions about MSNBC's future, including how it would operate without NBC News' resources, who gets what in the corporate divorce, and whether MSNBC could even keep its name.
MSNBC'S 'RISKY' REBRAND TO MS NOW DRAWS SKEPTICISM FROM BRANDING EXPERTS
Here is what to know ahead of MS NOW's launch:

In an effort to distance itself from NBC as part of the corporate separation, MSNBC is changing its name to MS NOW, an acronym for ""My Source for News, Opinion, and the World.""
When MSNBC first launched in 1996, ""MS"" originally stood for Microsoft, NBC's former partner in launching the network, although the company divested decades ago.
Notably, CNBC, MSNBC's sister network that Comcast is also spinning off into Versant, will keep its name as it has always stood for Consumer News and Business Channel.
The New York Times reportedMSNBC employed a $20 million ad campaign this month to sell viewers on the change, including an ad where Rachel Maddow reads the preamble to the U.S. Constitution. Another series of spots featured MSNBC hosts promising, ""Same mission, new name.""
MSNBC announced it is rebranding as ""MS NOW"" beginning Nov. 15.(Versant)
The name change sparked mixed reactions from inside the network.
Maddow told The New York Times she was initially ""annoyed"" by the name change but is now ""kind of happy about it.""
Maddow called it ""a hook to reintroduce ourselves to people, to reintroduce ourselves to the country, and remind our viewers what it is they like about us.""
One staffer previously toldFox News Digital, ""I don't get it"" and swiped that the new name wasn't meaningful. A second MSNBC insider said it was good for the new network to have similar initials for the sake of familiarity with loyal viewers, but that MS NOW was far from perfect. A third liked the name change.

Over the past year, a corporate custody battle unfolded between MSNBC and NBC News.
Everyone on MSNBC's current lineup will remain on the network through its MS NOW transformation, including Maddow, Jen Psaki, Chris Hayes, Lawrence O’Donnell, Nicolle Wallace, Ari Melber, Katy Tur, Stephanie Ruhle,Joe ScarboroughandMika Brzezinski.
However, NBC retained Steve Kornacki, the Peacock network's data and polling expert who had become a fixture on MSNBC's election night coverage. Andrea Mitchell, who ended her long-running MSNBC program ""Andrea Mitchell Reports"" in February, will remain with NBC as its chief Washington and foreign affairs correspondent. José Díaz-Balart departed MSNBC earlier this year and will continue anchoring ""NBC Nightly News Saturday,"" as well as Noticias Telemundo.
LIBERAL MEDIA SPLIT: WHO GETS WHAT IN THE MESSY NBC-MSNBC DIVORCE?
NBC reporters who will be part of MS NOW include justice beat reporters Ken Dilanian and Ryan Reilly, national correspondent Jacob Soboroff, White House correspondent Vaughn Hillyard and internet reporter Brandy Zadrozny. A slew of other staffers will also make the leap from NBC to MS NOW, like Meghan Rafferty, the former executive producer of ""NBC Nightly News"" who will serve as MS NOW's vice president of news standards.
Willie Geist, who currently hosts ""Sunday TODAY"" for NBC and co-hosts ""Morning Joe"" on MSNBC, landed a rare deal where he is able to maintain both roles at each network after the separation.
And as part of the divorce, NBC gets to keep the house, meaning MSNBC has packed up its boxes and left Rockefeller Center in New York City and vacated NBC's Washington, D.C., bureau near the U.S. Capitol. MSNBC has also had to build a news-gathering division from scratch, involving a huge hiring spree to fill its newsroom.

The name may change, but the progressive-leaning network will otherwise remain the same, according to statements made by leadership, including Versant CEO Mark Lazarus and MSNBC president Rebecca Kutler.
""While our name will be changing, who we are and what we do will not,"" Kutler wrote. ""Our commitment to our work and our audiences will not waiver from what the brand promise has been for three decades.""
""The direction of the network is not changing. Full stop,"" a network spokesperson previously told Fox News Digital.

A trend of Democrats rejecting money from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), one of the nation's most influential pro-Israel groups, is garnering intraparty backlash after an Arizona state representative slammed the shift as ""antisemitism under the guide of campaign virtue.""
Democrats have been pulling back from AIPAC and cozying up with other, more liberal Jewish groups, like J Street, highlighting a shift in the historical bipartisan consensus that saw both parties treat support for Israel as a given. This changing consensus, particularly within the Democratic Party, became more clear following the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel by Hamas terrorists.
While some Jewish groups have criticized Israeli Prime MinisterBenjamin Netanyahu'sapproach to the subsequent war that followed the attack, AIPAC has stood behind Netanyahu's strong response.
AIPAC's unwavering support for Israel after Oct. 7, 2023, was followed by a coalition of far-left Democrats, including Reps. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and other members of the ""Squad,"" who called for lawmakers to ""REJECT AIPAC."" Since then, a handful of other Democratic Party lawmakers have also rejected or returned money from AIPAC.

""I’m getting really sick and tired ofDemocratic candidateswho are announcing they will not ""accept"" AIPAC money, as it’s apparently the cool thing to say when you are running now,"" Democratic Arizona state Rep. Alma Hernandez said on X Wednesday.
""Let’s be clear: most voters have no idea what that even means. AIPAC itself doesn’t make candidate contributions; its supporters, many of whom, like me, are pro-Israel Democrats. I can assure you that most of you who are publicly announcing this would NEVER receive a dime from any of us.""
Following the cohort of radical Democrats in Congress launching their ""REJECT AIPAC"" coalition, other Democratic Partymembers of Congresstook action to reject AIPAC money as well.
Less than a year after his 2024 election victory, which was financially supported by AIPAC, Rep. Morgan McGarvey, D-Ky., said he would no longer take donations from AIPAC. Rep. Deborah Ross, D-N.C., and Rep. Valerie Foushee, D-N.C., made the same commitment  earlier this year.
Last month, Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., refunded past donations from AIPAC and pledged to reject any future funding from the group.

Hernandez had a stark message for any more Democrats thinking about doing the same.
""There are plenty of elected officials and candidates who have privately sought support over the years, and yes, I have the receipts of your text and emails,"" Hernandez said in her post on X. ""So, to any of you who are thinking of jumping on that wagon because you think it sounds like the cool thing these days, think again.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doj-asks-supreme-court-dismiss-snap-case,Justice Department withdraws SNAP appeal from Supreme Court as funding resumes,"National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss Trump's affordability push, give insight on the post-shutdown economy, and explain how 50-year mortgages and rate cuts could aid first-time buyers.
Lawyers for theTrump administrationon Thursday withdrew an emergency Supreme Court appeal centered on whether it must fully fund the nation's largest anti-hunger program during the government shutdown — ending a roughly three-week court fight over a benefits program that impacted millions of Americans.
The Justice Department said in withdrawing its emergency request that it considers the issue moot after Congress passed a bill to reopen the government, ending a 43-day government shutdown that is now the longest in U.S. history.
Trump signed off on the bill shortly after the House lawmakers voted 222-209 to approve it.
""That law, among other things, fully funds SNAP through the end of the fiscal year,"" DOJ lawyers said. ""Because the underlying dispute here is now moot, the government withdraws its November 7 stay application in this Court.""

The bill Trump signed Wednesday night reverses widespread federal layoffs and will allow furloughed employees to receive paychecks and backpay for the first time in roughly six weeks.
It will also relieve travel for millions of U.S. travelers whose flights were canceled or severely delayed as a result of the reduced workforce.
Crucially, it also restores full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, which lapsed on Nov. 1 for the first time in the program's 60-year history.
Roughly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits, prompting more than two dozen states to sue the U.S. Department of Agriculture late last month to keep the program fully funded.
Lower courts had ordered USDA to tap various contingency funds to fully fund SNAP benefits while the shutdown dragged on, prompting the Trump administration to appeal the matter to the Supreme Court for emergency intervention.

U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauerhad urged justicesto stay the lower court orders, citing progress Congress had made in recent days to forge consensus on a bill to reopen the government.
Justices this week agreed to stay the lower court order through Tuesday at 11:59 p.m., and later, extended it for two additional days at the administration's request.
The end of the shutdown keeps the government funded through January, even if it does not resolve the concerns over Obamacare subsidies that were a sticking point for most Democrat holdouts.

The news is likely to be welcome relief for the tens of millions of low-income Americans that rely on SNAP benefits to purchase groceries and keep their families fed.
The Trump administration on Saturday threatened to slap economic penalties or fees on states that did not immediately undo efforts to distribute full SNAP benefits for the month of November, in compliance with a lower court order one day earlier. (The U.S. Department of Agriculture previously agreed to pay just 65% of SNAP benefits for the month using the agency's contingency fund.)

The result was a patchwork system of benefits that varied from state to state, and as a result of various court orders — injecting fresh uncertainty and confusion over the benefits.

Open The Books, a project of American Transparency, a 501(c)3 nonprofit, nonpartisan charitable organization, closely tracks government spending andreleased an expansive reportWednesday ahead of a looming agreement between Republicans and Democrats to reopen the government, showing the swamp has gotten bigger, richer and more secretive since 2020.
The report, which analyzed all publicly disclosed federal salaries for fiscal year 2024, found a total of 2.9 million civilservice employeeswith a total payroll of $270 billion, plus an additional 30% for benefits. While the total number of employees rose by 5% since 2020, payroll grew nearly five times as much.

The current federal workforce is costing American taxpayers $673,000 per minute, $40.4 million per hour and just under $1 billion per day, according to Open The Books. This includes almost 1,000 workers who are making more than the president's $400,000 per year salary, 31,452 non-War Department federal employees who made more than every governor of all 50 states and 793,537 people making $100,000 or more. Those making $300,000 or more have seen an 84% increase since 2020, while there has similarly been an 82% increase in those earning $200,000 or more, the report points out.
During Open The Book's investigation, the fiscal watchdog group also found that the names of 383,000 federal workers across 56 different agencies were redacted, amounting to a total of $38.3 billion in pay. According to Open The Books CEO John Hart, ""You can't have accountability without visibility.""
""The Trump administration has a historic opportunity to bring much-needed transparency to the administrative state. While federal employees don't add as much to the debt as safety net programs, defense and overall agency spending, they are an indicator of government's growth,"" Hart said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
""Our investigators found far too many redactions and blind spots that DOGE should have already fixed. You can't have accountability without visibility. Taxpayers need a much clearer picture of the federal workforce than they have today.""
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa,has been working with Open The Books to fight for greater transparency. In a letter sent in September to Scott Kupor, the director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Ernst said she had identified ""numerous examples"" of full-time federal employees earning two salaries while moonlighting for other agencies or government contractors, something typically prohibited under the law. Ernst pointed out that this was being done without the approval or knowledge of these workers' managers.

""From 2021 to 2024, a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employee held multiple other full-time government contractor jobs, frequentlybilling taxpayersfor more than 24 hours of work in a single day,"" Ernst chronicled in her letter. ""In addition to HUD, she was paid by AmeriCorps and the National Institutes of Health. Since she teleworked in all three positions, she was able to hide her overlapping jobs and get away with billing taxpayers $225,866 for hours she never worked. She claimed she worked 26 hours on 13 of the 21 workdays in a single month.""
Ernst also described a second example of a human resources official at the Peace Corps who was caught falsifying time cards submitted to different agencies, which led to the employee double-billing taxpayers for tens of thousands of dollars. She laid out several other examples in the letter as well.
""Until recently, outside of death and taxes, the expanding Washington bureaucracy was one of the few certainties in life,"" said Ernst. ""I am proud to have partnered with the Trump administration and DOGE to successfully downsize the bloated bureaucracy, but there is much more work to be done to make Washington more efficient.""
One can ""look no further"" than the ""failed Schumer shutdown,"" Ernst said, pointing out that taxpayers will be on the hook for more than $12 billion in back pay for 750,000 non-essential federal employees who did not work for a month and a half.

In October, Ernst introduced the Non-Essential Workers Transparency Act, aimed at providing the public with an exact accounting of how much back pay the government will be required to fork over in the case of a shutdown.
The bill would require executive agencies to submit detailed reports to Congress within 30 days of a lapse in appropriations that must include the total number of employees and contractors employed by the agency at the time of the shutdown, the total salaries paid by the agency during the prior fiscal year, the number of furloughed during the lapse and their annual pay, the number of employees not furloughed and the sum of their pay and a requirement that all this information be posted publicly on the agencies' websites.",11/12/2025
https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyu-professor-claims-many-mothers-shifted-gop-2024-help-struggling-sons,NYU professor claims many mothers shifted to GOP in 2024 to help their struggling sons,"Scott Galloway suggested that one of the biggest rightward demographic shifts in the 2024 election happened because mothers of young men are trying to help their sons, the same young men whose group interests are ignored by progressives.
NYU professor Scott Galloway argued that one of the most notable shifts in the 2024 election came down to mothers trying to help their sons.
Galloway has spoken numerous times about thestruggles young men facein a changing world, while the modern progressive movement appears to ignore their interests as a group. During an appearance on Nicolle Wallace’s podcast ""The Best People,"" Galloway said he ""won the jackpot"" for being a White man born in the 1960s, part of a generation that had access to wealth and affordable homes.
""Men of my generationhave a debt, and the way I try to pay that debt is I try to raise awareness around the struggles of young men, because they’re being held accountable and guilty for my privilege,"" he said.
The message is not always well received by his liberal allies, however, he said, noting that ""when I start talking about this stuff, there’s an understandable gag reflex from progressives, from women, from non-Whites.""

Wallace recalled an earlier conversation they’d had on this subject, concluding that, in the 2024 election, ""it wasn’t just young men lured into the Trump-adjacent manosphere, but also their mothers.""
""We don’t like to have these conversations because, you know, the truth sometimes doesn’t reflect either gender well, and the reality is there’s still a lot of women who will vote for who they perceive as best for their husbands and sons,"" Gallowaysaid.
He noted that the three groups who shifted most prominently from blue to red between the 2020 and 2024 elections were Hispanics, voters under age 30 and women ages 45 to 64.
He explained that, from a young man’s perspective, ""Everything I need to get ahead — all the keys to dating, savings, pride, owning a home, being successful — are getting harder and more expensive,"" he said. As a result, he said many people just want to shake up the system.
""As you referenced, I thought the most interesting shift was that women ages 45 to 64 pivoted hardest toward red, and my thesis is that’s their mothers — because if your son is in the basement, ‘vaping and playing video games,’ you don’t give a s--- about territorial sovereignty in Ukraine or transgender rights,"" he continued.

Galloway said that the basic social contract in any society is that if you play by the rules and are a good citizen, your children will have a better life than you did. He claimed that for the first time in nearly three centuries of U.S. history, people in their 30s are generally worse off financially than their parents were at the same age.
""Almost half of men under 24 are living at home. One in five men age 30 are living at home. One in three will live at home at some point before 25,"" he said. ""And all I can tell you is, if you’re the parent of a struggling kid, your whole world shrinks to that kid.""
While he said these problems affect women as well, men are more at risk because of how society tends to work. Men will date women poorer than themselves, but women tend not to date men poorer than themselves.
""When the pool of ‘horizontal and up’ males keeps shrinking, there’s a lack of household formation,"" he said, noting that 75% of women say economic status matters in a partner.

As a result, today’s economic and social trends have left a large pool of romantically unviable men with few opportunities for advancement.
""The most unstable, violent societies in the world all have one thing in common — a disproportionate number of young men lacking economic and romantic opportunities,"" he warned.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/conde-nast-infuriates-newsguild-firing-four-staffers-who-confronted-hr-chief-over-company-layoffs,Condé Nast infuriates NewsGuild by firing four staffers who confronted HR chief over company layoffs,"FOX Business correspondent Madison Alworth has the latest on the increase in students enrolling in trade skills amid job elimination due to AI on The Story.
The NewsGuild of New York is furious withmedia juggernautCondé Nast, accusing the company of ""retaliatory"" firings after four employees were terminated for badgering a high-powered executive.
A group of Condé Nast staffers confronted HR chief Stan Duncan last week outside his C-suite office at the company’s 1 World Trade Center headquarters to ""demand answers"" on recent layoffs at WIRED and Teen Vogue. Duncan didn’t appreciate being bombarded by the rank-and-file and quickly urged them to return to their workspaces immediately.
""His response was essentially, both literally and figuratively, to close the door in their face,"" NewsGuild of New York president Susan DeCarava told Fox News Digital.

The caught-on-camera interaction resulted in the termination of four of the employees involved. The clip,posted on social mediaby TheWrap, has been viewed more than four million times on X, as of Wednesday morning.
Bon Appétit digital producer Alma Avalle, who is also a NewsGuild of New York leader and trans activist, was terminated, along with Wired senior White House reporter Jake Lahut, The New Yorker senior fact-checker Jasper Lo and Condé Nast Entertainment videographer Ben Dewey.
DeCarava blasted the firings as ""grossly illegal tactics"" designed to union-bust and intimidate.
""[Condé Nast] basically terminated them, fired them without cause, without justification, and in complete violation of the contract, which requires that management take certain steps before it goes to this ultimate kind of disciplinary act of firing someone, causing them to lose their job,"" DeCarava said, noting that other staffers who confronted Duncan were suspended without pay.
""We don't want employers to think that just because the Trump administration seems hell-bent on demonizing the press and doing away with free press and finding ways to inhibit an independent press, and free speech that the employer should then use that as an excuse to basically ignore or abrogate the collective bargaining agreements we've reached with them,"" DeCarava added. ""How do you own a media publication, or immediate empire, and you can't answer a couple of simple questions from your own workers?""

Benett/Getty Images)
DeCarava believes Duncan responded the way he did to ""avoid having to be accountable"" for decisions that upended the lives of Condé Nast staffers.
""People are really upset. They're upset for their co-workers on a personal level. They are upset for the bigger implications for it within Condé,"" she said.
Duncan, the chief people officer for Condé Nast, ""leads all HR functions, including talent acquisition and development, diversity and inclusion, employment practices, HR technology and workforce planning, and strategic business partnering,"" according to hiscompany bio.
Condé Nast said staffers were terminated for cause.
""Most people recognize that the misconduct exhibited by union members last week wouldn't be acceptable in any workplace. Their employment was terminated with cause, as they were in violation of our company policies. Blaming the ramifications of their own misconduct on the Trump administration is pretty absurd,"" a Condé Nast spokesperson told Fox News Digital.
DeCarava and the NewsGuild have planned a rally for Wednesday evening outside Condé Nast headquarters at the World Trade Center inNew York. The plan is to call for the reinstatement of Avalle, Lahut, Lo and Dewey, who have been billed as the ""Fired Four"" by colleagues.
""These folks were exercising their rights under federal labor law. They certainly had the right to do it under the contract… also just this principle of like, free speech and accountability and transparency,"" DeCarava said.
""What Stan Duncan could have done is said, ‘I can't meet with you right now, but I'm happy to meet in another time. Let's make a date,’"" she continued.  ""He could have even said, ‘You know what? I can't talk right now, but I understand there's an issue,’ and not fired anybody, not disciplined anybody.""

TheGuild representsnearly 6,000 media professionals in New York, including staffers at The New York Times, The New Yorker, Thomson Reuters, The Nation, Condé Nast, TIME, PEOPLE, Consumer Reports, and ProPublica.
While the Guild is going to bat for the ""Fired Four"" and even started a fundraiser to cover their expenses while out of work, other media industry professionals believe ambushing an executive wasn’t the best idea.
""This is appallingly insubordinate and disrespectful behavior. No wonder they fired four people,"" RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway wrote in response to video of the incident.
The layoffs that irked the ""Fired Four"" in the first place included an announcement that Teen Vogue would transition from a separate publication to being part of Vogue.com. The headcount reduction that came with the change caught the attention of the Guild, which noted the left-wing outlet was laying off minorities.
""Management plans to lay off six of our members, most of whom are BIPOC women or trans, including Teen Vogue’s Politics Editor — continuing the trend of layoffs at Condé disproportionately impacting marginalized employees,"" the Guild said in a statement.
""Nearly all of these staffers identify as LGBTQ. As of today, only one woman of color remains on the editorial staff at Teen Vogue,"" the Guild continued. ""Condé leadership owes us answers — and Teen Vogue’s readership. We will get those answers.""

""I think Condé thought they might try and send us a message. And the message that we got was that they're not to be trusted,"" she continued. ""I don’t think Condé totally understands what they’ve triggered here.""
A Condé Nast sent a memo to staffers on Monday explaining that the company was attempting to answer questions when the incident occurred.

""While our labor relations team was meeting with union representatives to address their questions in accordance with the agreement, the union chose to simultaneously stage a protest in the office, encouraged by a non-employee NewsGuild representative who also participated in the protest,"" the memo stated.
""In following our company policies, we took disciplinary action against employees who were engaged in harassing and intimidating conduct that interfered with our business operations. These decisions were not made lightly,"" the memo continued. ""This behavior is also a violation of our collective bargaining agreement with the union, and we filed a charge with theNational Labor Relations Board.""
Condé Nast and the Guild have each filed unfair labor practice charges against each other. A Condé Nast insider toldFox News Digitalthat the company has filed three previous grievances this year with the union about similar behavior. The insider also said several minutes of the incident are missing from the viral video.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-50-year-mortgage-just-introduces-new-kind-debt,Trump’s 50-year mortgage just introduces a new kind of debt,"Former Trump economic advisor Stephen Moore joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss the possibility of President Donald Trump proposing a 50-year mortgage to incentivize young homebuyers.
The montage of the American Dream begins with a front door and a mortgage. PresidentDonald Trumpis correct to say that the dream is slipping out of reach for too many families. Home prices have skyrocketed, mortgage rates have doubled since 2021, and young Americans are finding it more challenging than ever to buy a home and put down roots.
So it’s no surprise that the administration is exploring new ways to ""make housing affordable again."" One of those ideas, a50-year fixed-rate mortgage, promises smaller monthly payments by stretching out the life of the loan.
But the problem isn’t the rates or lengths of mortgages; it’s the cost of the house.

Extending loan terms just spreads the pain over more years. Longer mortgages might lower the monthly bill, but they multiply the total debt. On a $400,000 loan at 6% interest, a 50-year mortgage means paying roughly $1.26 million over the life of the loan, more than triple the original amount. After 20 years, you’d still owe almost $350,000.
HOUSING COSTS ARE CRUSHING FAMILIES – HERE’S THE WAY OUT
The real challenge is that the government has made ittoo expensive to buildand buy homes in the first place. Washington and local governments pile on costs at every step through tariffs, taxes, fees and endless red tape. Builders can’t build affordably when they’re forced to navigate an obstacle course of regulation and delay.
Even Bill Pulte, President Trump’s housing chief and a longtime homebuilder himself, has acknowledged how high interest rates and housing costs are ""really hurting people."" He’s right about the pain families are feeling, but the solution is lower costs. As any economist can tell you, affordability begins with more supply, not more subsidies.
Mackenzie Bishop, a homebuilder with Abrazos Homes in Albuquerque, recently laid out the math in blunt terms.Local taxes and feesadd more than $40,000 to the cost of every new home before a single nail is hammered. Add property tax increases of 50 to 70% on multifamily projects, and new construction grinds to a halt. Multiply that across the country, and it’s no wonder builders can’t keep up with demand or why the homes that do get built are out of reach for working families.
WHY YOUR PARENTS COULD AFFORD A HOUSE ON ONE SALARY – BUT YOU CAN’T ON TWO
It’s the same story nationwide. Tariffs have raised the prices of building materials like lumber, steel and concrete. Meanwhile, permitting and environmental reviews can delay projects for years, driving up financing costs and draining the incentive to build at all.
These are the hidden taxes that keepAmerica’s housing supplyartificially scarce, and that scarcity – not the length of the mortgage – is what drives prices higher.
Even as inflation has cooled from its peak, prices are still rising about 3% a year. ""Sticky"" costs like rent, insurance and shelter remain stubbornly high. That means families’ paychecks are stretched thin before they even start saving for a down payment. The Federal Reserve may eventually cut interest rates, but unless we fix the underlying supply problem, housing will remain unaffordable no matter the loan term.

The good news is that conservatives already know how to fix this. Instead of inventing new forms of debt, we can make it easier and cheaper to build the homes Americans need. That means streamlining permitting andcutting the bureaucracythat slows construction, eliminating tariffs that drive up the price of materials, and expanding legal immigration to rebuild the skilled trades workforce that keeps the housing market moving.
It also means reforming zoning laws that allow a handful of activists to block entire neighborhoods and phasing out federal subsidies that inflate prices by distorting credit markets. Together, these reforms would tackle the real causes of high housing costs: scarcity, inefficiency and government overreach.
Do those things, and the market will do what it does best: deliver abundance, innovation and opportunity.

The goal of homeownership is worth fighting for. It strengthens families, builds communities and creates generational wealth. But we can’t borrow our way to prosperity. The answer to high housing costs isn’t a longer mortgage; it’s a lighter burden.
President Trump’s instinct to put working families first is right on target. The best way tomake housing affordable againis to unleash America’s builders, entrepreneurs and workers, not to create a new kind of debt. Let builders build. Let markets work. Let families keep more of what they earn. That’s how we restore the American Dream: build, baby, build.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-signature-tariffs-hang-key-question-about-congress-power-before-supreme-court,Trump's signature tariffs hang on key question about Congress' power before Supreme Court,"Former Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo joins 'The Sunday Briefing' to weigh in on the Supreme Court’s skepticism over President Donald Trump’s power to impose international tariffs.
TheSupreme Courtis weighing whether to expand presidential power in a case over Donald Trump’s global tariffs, but key constitutional issues could doom the president’s argument.
The high court raised separation of powers concerns during recent oral arguments about the absence of Congress’ role in Trump’s sweeping trade plan, which the president has said is critical to foreign policy and national security and a matter of ""life or death"" for the country.
Justices across the ideological spectrum peppered Solicitor General John Sauer, the lawyer arguing on behalf of Trump, with questions about whether the president overstepped his authority. They framed their inquiries at times around two legal principles, known as the major questions and non-delegation doctrines, and scrutinized the text of the emergency law Trump invoked to enact the tariffs.
Justice Clarence Thomas set the stage for the nearly three-hour arguments. In the first question of the day, Thomas, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, asked Sauer to ""spend a few minutes on why exactly the major questions doctrine doesn't apply to the president in this case.""

Under the principle, courts look to make sure the executive branch has not used a vaguely written law to carry out an act of major national significance, like worldwide tariffs.
Sauer responded that the tariffs case, which involved foreign trade deals, was a ""particularly poor fit"" to apply the major questions doctrine because courts should give broader power to the president on foreign policy matters.
Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the CATO Institute, which has sided against Trump in the case, told Fox News Digital he has seen two trends emerge from the Supreme Court. One is a long-term trend where the high court is highly deferential to the president on overseas matters, but the other, he said, was a more recent use of the major questions doctrine.
Courts have increasingly used the doctrine to demand clear statutory permission for blockbuster policies, striking down agency actions in West Virginia v. EPA andBiden v. Nebraska. Several justices asked whether that same rule applies when the president, rather than an agency, claims sweeping tariff power under the statute Trump used, which never mentions the word ""tariffs.""
""It's not clear which trend will play out,"" Skorup said. ""My hunch is that most, and this was confirmed at oral arguments, most justices are probably leaning towards favoring the importers and these more recent doctrinal trends will prevail."" He added he was encouraged by Chief Justice Roberts pressing Sauer about the matter.
""He seemed to think there's a major questions problem here,"" Skorup said.

Trump has beenon a rampage this week, emphasizing the perceived stakes of the case, a sign that he could be bracing for an unfavorable outcome.
Trump claimed that if the tariffs are deemed illegal, the potential refund process could exceed $3 trillion. He said the justices were given ""wrong numbers"" about repayment costs.
""It would not be possible to ever make up for that kind of ‘drubbing,’"" Trump wrote on social media. ""That would truly become an insurmountable National Security Event, and devastating to the future of our Country – Possibly non-sustainable!""
Trump used the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to sidestep Congress' role in approving taxes and tariffs, saying the opioid epidemic and trade deficit amounted to a national emergency and justified a host of tariffs on imports from major trading partners from China and India to Canada and Mexico. Trump has touted the billions in revenue collected by the government and said it will be used to pay $2,000 to lower-income families and pay off some of the national debt.
TRUMP’S OWN SCOTUS PICKS COULD WIND UP HURTING HIM ON TARIFFS

But the justices repeatedly questioned how Trump could justify bypassingCongress, especially when IEEPA was not clear on the matter. Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Sonia Sotomayor, Trump and Obama appointees, respectively, grilled Sauer about how IEEPA did not spell out that the president could unilaterally enact tariffs, even if it did give the president the power to ""regulate imports.""
The Supreme Court could also factor the non-delegation doctrine into its finding, either in an avoidant or direct way. The key question is, even if IEEPA could be read to allow tariffs, would that reading hand the president Congress’s core tariff authority without a limiting principle?
Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, seemed particularly interested in the issue, asking Sauer if Congress could ""delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations as he sees fit.""
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
If the Supreme Court were to take the avoidant route, according to Ilan Wurman, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, it could interpret IEEPA narrowly to avoid a possible finding that Congress improperly passed off its tariff authority to the president. Wurman told Fox News Digital that would be easier than directly concluding that Congress gave up its constitutional power to another branch of government.
But, Wurman said, ""on the other hand, every century or so the Supreme Court should strike something down under the non-delegation doctrine. Give it a little life here and there, right?""
A decision is expected by late June.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/parents-rights-group-releases-scathing-lookout-warning-targeting-top-2-teachers-unions-indoctrination,Parents' rights group releases scathing 'Lookout' warning targeting top 2 teachers unions: 'Indoctrination',"Former Oklahoma state superintendent Ryan Walters says he is committed to a national campaign against teachers unions, describing them as the ""worst force of evil"" in modern America.
FIRST ON FOX:A topparents’ rights organizationis sending a ""Lookout"" warning to parents urging vigilance against two of the top teachers unions in the United States, making the case that they are ""prioritizing radical agendas"" at the ""expense of educational outcomes.""
Thewarning, sent by the American Parents Coalition, targets the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) and National Education Association (NEA) and, in addition to concerns about student outcomes not being the priority, highlights a report that it says shows the unions ""have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in woke organizations.""
The APC warning hits the NEA and AFT for pushing a variety of far-left causes, including boycotts in support of DEI, legal and activist campaigns against the Trump administration, denouncing a Supreme Court ruling that ""enabled parents to opt their children out of age inappropriate and one-sided LGBTQ+ content,"" and climate activism.
""Teachers’ unions were created to support educators and improve classroom instruction. Instead, they have transformed into radical political organizations that exploit their influence to push far-left ideology instead of prioritizing student academic success,"" APC Executive Director Alleigh Marré told Fox News Digital in a statement.

""Parents should be aware of the outsized influence these unions have on their child’s school, because these organizations may be pushing policies that undermine parental trust and do nothing to further a child’s education. Every year the teachers’ unions funnel millions of dollars into campaigns and activist causes that almost exclusively favor Democrats, while students continue to fall further and further behind on foundational subjects. Families expect schools to teach reading, writing, and math, not political slogans. It is time for teachers’ unions to prioritize academic teaching, restore transparency, and refocus on the purpose of education to prepare children for success, not indoctrination.""
The warning also focused on the NEA 2025 Handbook, which the APC claims ""exposed the organization’s radical beliefs"" and ""attacks homeschooling.""
""The handbook touted the use ofpreferred names and pronounsas of the ‘utmost importance’ whileblaming‘white supremacy culture’ as the ‘primary root cause of institutional racism,’"" the APC warning states.

Fox News Digital reached out to the NEA and AFT for comment.
The warning also provided templates for parents to formally file complaints and call on their local school boards to take action prioritizing student performance.
""Parents have the right to know what their children are taught, approve sensitive content, see who influences the classroom, and hold decision-makers accountable,"" the report states.
""It’s time to reclaim parental authority, and to demand teachers’ unions focus on academic success and not divisive ideologies.""

Fox News Digitalreported earlier this yearthat the NEA and AFT have poured tens of millions into far-left causes, including left-wing philanthropic behemoths like the Tides Network, New Venture Fund, Sixteen-Thirty Fund and Future Forward.
The unions also forked over significant amounts of cash for groups that focus on supportingleft-wing candidatesfor public office, such as the Democratic Governors Association, Democrat's House Majority and Senate Majority PACs.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/shutdown-ends-furious-democrats-eat-own,"As shutdown ends, furious Democrats eat their own","Sen. Tim Kaine accused MSNBC host Katy Tur of exaggerating when she described Democratic Party infighting over his vote to help end the government shutdown.
TheSchumer Shutdownappears to be ending. It’s about time. By refusing to vote for a ""clean"" continuing resolution which would have kept government spending at levels they themselves approved earlier, Democrats have held the country hostage for a record-breaking 41 days. They have hurt Americans, angered their union allies and dampened consumer sentiment. For what?
What didSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumerand his Democratic colleagues gain from throwing hundreds of thousands out of work, endangering American air travelers, causing great hardship and anxiety for those dependent on SNAP benefits, and slowing the growth of the U.S. economy?
Nothing. They did not win an extension of Obamacare premium subsidies, they did not undo the Medicaid reforms that they fought tooth and nail and – worst of all for Schumer – the shutdown in no way endeared him to the democratic socialists who are tearing his party in two. Far from it.
One critic said of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, ""If you can’t lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?""(Tom Brenner/Getty Images)
Last spring, when Sen. Schumer joined with Republicans to keep the government open, he was blasted by progressives in his party who have vowed to ""resist"" PresidentDonald Trumpat every turn. They were furious that he gave in to the GOP and didn’t win any concessions for allowing the government to continue to function.
IT’S NOT JUST THE ECONOMY — THIS IS HOW DEMOCRATS BEAT THE GOP ACROSS THE COUNTRY
Never mind that polls always show that most Americans want our two political parties to work together to resolve the nation’s problems. Never mind that the president was elected by a majority of U.S. voters. The left, as is, simply won’t have it, democracy be damned.
One of Schumer’s harshest critics at the time was far-left ""Squad"" memberAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has hinted she might challenge her party’s de facto leader as he approaches re-election in 2028. In April, polling showed AOC could win that matchup.
Today, Schumer is again in hot water. California Rep. Ro Khanna, a progressive who represents Silicon Valley, has called for the ouster of Schumer as minority leader. He and other liberals are furious that Schumer failed to keep his party united, instead allowing eight members of the Senate Democratic caucus to vote for beginning to reopen the government.
Khanna posted on X: ""If you can’t lead the fight to stophealthcare premiumsfrom skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?""
WHY MAMDANI WILL SERVE TWO TERMS NO MATTER HOW BAD NYC GETS
Schumer is also being attacked for not endorsingZohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old antisemitic democratic socialist who was recently elected mayor of New York City. Schumer could not endorse Mamdani without angering his Jewish supporters and without alienating moderate Democrats who are rightly horrified that their party has been hijacked by the far left.
Progressive Wisconsin Rep. Mark Pocan is calling to replace Schumer, posting on X: ""Don’t endorse or say who you voted for in NYC despite there being a Dem candidate. Get Dem Senators to negotiate a terrible ‘deal’ that does nothing real about healthcare. Screw over a national political party….Next…""
Schumer isn’t the only Democratic official in the crosshairs of his own party. Progressive New York City Councilman Chi Osse is apparently set to challenge House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries when the latter is up for re-election next year. Another New York representative, Richie Torres, will face off against yet another anti-Israel progressive, former Bronx Assemblyman Michael Blake. Elsewhere, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is facing a primary challenge from her own leftist lieutenant governor.
THE GOP'S 2026 CHALLENGE — HOLDING TRUMP'S BASE WHEN HE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT
Meanwhile, as Democrats eat their own, Americans are discovering the truth about Obamacare.Schumer and his Senate colleagueswere fighting to prolong the enhanced subsidies established under President Joe Biden that made ACA health insurance premiums more affordable. Those subsidies were meant to expire at the end of this year. However, it turns out that premium costs without those subsidies would skyrocket, putting insurance out of reach for millions of families.
The subsidies under consideration were included in the American Rescue Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, both of which passed with zero Republican votes. Thus, having Democrats blame the GOP for the expiration of those payments is ridiculous.
The truth is that Obamacare, which covers only 7% of Americans and was also passed only with Democratic votes, is a failed program. It was meant to bring the cost of health insurance down, but never did. It was set up so that millions of young, healthy Americans would be forced to sign up as a result of the ""individual mandate,"" a tax penalty which compelled people to have health insurance whether they wanted it or not. The healthcare costs of that young cohort were expected to be low, offsetting the higher expenses of older and sicker Americans.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ended the unpopular individual mandate, thus overturning the underlying method of spreading the cost of insurance over a larger pool of people. As a result, Obamacare increasingly covered individuals with higher healthcare costs, and premiums rose.
Obamacare premiums in general will rise about 30% for next year; with the expiration of the enhanced subsidies, some people are going to be hit with a premium hike of 50% or more.
Democrats are blaming the GOP for creating a ""healthcare crisis,"" but that is dishonest. They voted for Obamacare, and they hid its true costs for years by offering ever more generous subsidies. And, they voted to allow those subsidies to expire. The cost of continuing those payments would be some $350 billion over 10 years, not including interest payments; the Trump administration wants to find a better path forward.

Few Republicans want to tackle overhauling Obamacare, or our convoluted healthcare system, as both have proven in the past to be ""third-rail"" political issues. President Trump has proposed giving the billions of dollars that fund Affordable Care Acttax creditsdirectly to Americans instead, rather than funneling those monies through insurers. That would presumably give consumers greater choice and better control of their healthcare dollars.
That seems a promising approach but, really, it’s just the tip of the Obamacare iceberg.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/american-workers-being-replaced-inside-h-1b-visa-controversy,Are American workers being replaced? Inside the H-1B visa controversy,"Fox News Digital spoke to Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello about how the visa program needs to be fixed to give American workers more opportunity.
Following months of controversy, PresidentDonald Trumpissued a proclamation in September decrying the systemic abuse of the H-1B visa program, which he said is fueling the ""large-scale replacement of American workers"" that ""has undermined both our economic and national security.""
To address this, Trump instituted a $100,000 fee for companies seeking to obtain an H-1B visa, a move that has been widely criticized by business leaders, especially in thetech industry.
Debate over the program has split both the American public and the GOP, with one side saying the visa holders are poaching American jobs and the other saying it is vital to U.S. competitiveness.
So, what areH-1B visas, and why have they become a political flashpoint?

An H-1B visa is a non-immigrant work visa that allows companies in the U.S. to hire highly-skilled foreign workers in specialty occupations for an initial period of three years, which can be extended to six years.
The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website states that the visas are meant for individuals of ""exceptional merit and ability."" Individuals must have at least a bachelor’s degree in a relevant field.
By far the industry most heavily utilizing H-1B visas is the tech industry, which accounts for roughly 60% to 70% of all the new applications in recent years.
Other top industries include consulting and professional services, engineering and manufacturing, healthcare and medical research and higher education.

There is no official figure for the number of people currently holding H-1B visas.
There is a yearly cap of 65,000 people who can obtain H-1B visas. The program allows for an additional 20,000 individuals holding master’s degrees or above. Notably, most universities and non-profit research organizations are cap-exempt, further increasing the number of people being approved each year.
The Pew Research Center estimated that about 400,000 H-1B visa applications were approved last year under the Biden administration.
Nearly 3 out of every 4, 73%, of H-1B visa holders comefrom India, according to Pew. The country with the second-highest number of visa holders is China, with 12%. The remaining 15% comes from a mix of other countries, with no single country reaching the 2% threshold.
The H-1B visa program has been criticized on both sides of the political aisle, including from Trump to Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Critics say the current program has veered away from its original intent to attract top talent to work in the U.S. and instead is being used by employers to import cheap foreign labor, depress wages, and cut out American workers.
Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Senate Judiciary Chair Sen.Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, reintroduced bipartisan legislation in September to reform and close loopholes in the H-1B program to protect American workers and stop the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries.
On the state level, Florida Republican Gov.Ron DeSantisissued guidance in October to combat the university loophole. DeSantis directed the Florida Board of Governors to end the practice of higher education institutions ""importing foreign workers on H-1B visas instead of hiring Americans"" by requiring universities to ""put American graduates first and ensure taxpayer-funded schools serve the American workforce.""
On the other side of the debate, prominent figures such asElon Muskhave advocated for H-1B visas because the program is essential for the U.S. to maintain its competitive edge.
Shortly before Trump returned to the Oval Office, Musk said, ""The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B"" and pledged to ""go to war"" in support of the program.
However, Musk also noted his belief that ""the program is broken and needs major reform.""

He proposed ""raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically.""
Business leaders have said the H-1B program is important in competing with countries such as China, which just recently launched a similar program, called the K-visa, to attract top talent to the country. The program went into effect on Oct. 1.
The H-1B program also has the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
On Sept. 19, Trump issued a presidential proclamation titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers,"" in which he said the H-1B visa program was being ""deliberately exploited to replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.""
Trump said this abuse has been used by companies to ""artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields.""
The president wrote that ""the large-scale replacement of American workers through systemic abuse of the program has undermined both our economic and national security.""

As such, Trump imposed a $100,000 fee, effective Sept. 21, 2025. The restriction will expire one year from the effective date.
Trump also directed his administration to ""initiate a rulemaking to prioritize the admission as nonimmigrants of high-skilled and high-paid aliens.""
Meanwhile, another DHS rule will narrow the definition of ""specialty occupation"" that will allow the department officials to increase worksite compliance inspections before and after an H-1B petition, and require the petitioner’s employer to make the application directly — a move to stop companies from bringing in H-1B immigrants and then contracting them to other companies.
The debate over H-1B visas promises to continue in the coming months and years.
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has sued the Trump administration to stop its implementation of the $100,000 application requirement, which it says would ""make it cost-prohibitive for U.S. employers, especially start-ups and small and midsize businesses, to utilize the H-1B program.""
The lawsuit argues that the new fee is unlawful because it overrides provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act that govern the H-1B program, including a requirement that fees be based on the costs incurred by the government in processing visas.

The chamber previously warned that restrictions on the H-1B program ""have the potential to inflict serious harm upon many American companies.""
The case is currently ongoing. It remains to be seen whetherCongress will ultimatelyweigh in one way or another on the issue.

The crisis hit an agency already under pressure.

With Congress deadlocked, about 13,000 controllers and 50,000 TSA agents are working without pay.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-not-just-economy-how-democrats-beat-gop-across-country,It’s not just the economy — this is how Democrats beat the GOP across the country,"Campus Reform reporter Emily Sturge joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss President Donald Trump's warning, why young voters supported Zohran Mamdani in the election and more.
The ballots are counted, the pundits are spinning, and theverdict is in: affordability isn’t just an issue — it’s the issue. Democrats understood that and they won. Big. Republicans, meanwhile, are facing challenges that look strikingly similar to those that cost Democrats so dearly just two years ago.
Tax cuts for the rich vs. affordability for all
Democrats didn’t win because they suddenly became masterful campaigners, or because their candidates were flawless. They won because they focused on what’s keeping Americans up at night— rising prices, shrinking paychecks and the anxiety that the American Dream is slipping further away. They promised to cap drug prices, rein in healthcare costs and make life a little less punishing for the middle class.
And crucially, Democratsran unapologeticallyon taxing the rich — a message that resonated far beyond their base. For years, Republicans have viewed calls to raise taxes on the wealthy as an attack on success, a threat to the American ethos of upward mobility. But for many Americans, and for Democrats this cycle, it was about fairness. If you’re rich, you can afford to pay more. After all, the rich aren’t struggling — everyone else is. That sense of basic justice, not class warfare, is what made the message so powerful and popular.
MARK PENN: DEMOCRATS WIN THE MOMENT, BUT LEFT-WING TILT THREATENS THEIR FUTURE
Republicans, by contrast, leaned onfamiliar themes: tax cuts, deregulation and the promise that economic growth would lift all boats. But, this time, voters seemed to want something more immediate and tangible. In poll after poll, affordability dwarfed every other concern. Democrats beat Republicans by eight points on who could best handle the cost of living. When one party is talking about your grocery bill and the other is defending capital gains, the outcome isn’t a mystery.
Not just ""The Economy, Stupid"" — it’s affordability
There’s a twist inthis year’s resultsthat’s easy to miss, but crucial to understand: while Republicans still hold an edge when voters are asked who’s better for ""the economy"" in general, Democrats won on the issue that mattered most — affordability.
Polls show that Americans continue to trust Republicans more on broad economic stewardship. But, when it comes to the day-to-day reality of paying for groceries, rent, healthcare and gas, Democrats pulled ahead. In a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll, cost-of-living concerns topped the list of voter priorities, and Democrats were favored on the specific question of who can make life more affordable.
This isn’t just about GDP or stock market numbers. It’s about the price of eggs, the cost of a doctor’s visit and whether families feel they can get ahead. Voters weren’t just asking, ""Who can grow the economy?"" They were asking, ""Who can make my paycheck go further?""
The lesson: It’s not just ""the economy, stupid."" It’s that things cost too much, and most people feel like they’re running in place. Theparty that understands— and addresses — that reality is the one that wins.
The GOP’s Familiar Challenge
After the election, President Trump sat down with Fox News’ Bret Baier and admitted, ""We learned a lot."" But in the same breath, he suggested that things aren’t so bad after all. ""The country is doing very well,"" he said, pointing to falling energy prices and predicting a return to $2 gasoline. The message was: we’ve done this before, and we can do it again.
Yet, for many voters, the reassurance didn’t quite land. The gap between political optimism and everyday reality was hard to ignore. While Republicans highlighted their record and warned about the dangers of socialism, those arguments were sometimes overshadowed by internal divisions — most notably, a rising tide of antisemitism that’s fracturing the party and distracting from the issues that matter most.
If this all feels familiar, it should.
2024 in reverse
This is 2024 in reverse. Back then, Democrats tried to reassure voters that the economy wasn’t as bad as it felt, even as Americans struggled with rising costs. The left was busy debating ""wokeism,"" alienating moderates and driving away the very voters it needed most.
Now, it’s the GOP’s turn to face a similar crossroads: emphasizing past achievements and ideological battles, while voters are looking for immediate relief. Democrats, having learned from their own missteps, are laser-focused on affordability — and it’s paying off.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The cycle continues
Here’s the lesson, as old as politics itself: Ignore the kitchen table, and you lose the house. When a party becomes more invested in defending its own narrative than in addressing real pain, it risks losing trust — and elections.
If Republicans want to avoid thefate that befell Democrats, they may need to shift from reassurance to action. Voters want to know not just that things can get better, but how — and when. Because here’s the twist: the party that owns affordability owns the future.
The closing thought

So, as the dust settles, ask yourself: When was the last time a voter changed their mind because a politician told them their problems weren’t real? When was the last time a party won by focusing on yesterday’s debates instead of today’s bills?
The answer is rarely, if ever. And if that feels like a revelation, maybe it’s time for both parties to stop telling Americans what to think — and start listening to what they’re saying.

The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act sets out several core obligations:
TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA
The goal is to create a clear, consistent data source on how AI changes employment.
AI is alreadyreshaping the American workforce, and lawmakers from both parties say the country needs a clear view of what that means for jobs.

Hawley warnedthat the trend is accelerating.
""Artificial intelligence is already replacing American workers, and experts project AI could drive unemployment up to 10 to 20% in the next five years,"" Hawley said. ""The American people need to have an accurate understanding of how AI is affecting our workforce, so we can ensure that AI works for the people, not the other way around.""
Warner agreed, sayinggood data is key to good policy
""This bipartisan legislation will finally give us a clear picture of AI's impact on the workforce, what jobs are being eliminated, which workers are being retrained, and where new opportunities are emerging,"" he said. ""Armed with this information, we can make sure AI drives opportunity instead of leaving workers behind.""
PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS
Their shared goal is simple. The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act would make AI's workforce impact visible and accountable. It gives you and policymakers the hard data needed to guide smarter decisions about automation and employment.
While the bill sounds promising, several hurdles remain. The biggest challenge is consistency. Each company decides what counts as an AI-related job impact, which could lead to uneven or incomplete reporting.
Smaller businesses might also escape the rules altogether if they fall outside the reporting thresholds. That could leave big gaps in understanding how automation affects local or niche industries.
Data quality is another concern. Even with reporting requirements, the system relies on companies to share accurate information. The Department of Labor will need strong verification to make sure the reports reflect reality.

And while transparency is valuable, it doesn't automatically protect jobs. The law can expose the problem, but real progress will depend on what policymakers and employers do with that data.
The AI-Related Job Impacts Clarity Act would make companies report when automation replaces, adds or reshapes jobs.(Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
If you work in an industry whereAI toolsare becoming common, this bill could directly affect you. It would make it easier to see how automation changes jobs across the country. You'll be able to find out which roles are being replaced and which ones are being created.
This new level of visibility could also pressure employers to be more transparent about layoffs. Companies may start explaining whether job cuts are truly due to AI or part of broader business shifts. That accountability could help workers plan smarter for the future.
With clearer data, policymakers and training programs can step in faster. If large numbers of people in a certain field lose work because of automation, the government could push forretraining or job placement efforts. It may even help workers prepare earlier by learning new digital or technical skills before AI impacts their roles.

Overall, this bill puts information in the public's hands so workers can understand what's happening to their jobs instead of being left in the dark.

In August, Joe got a message from a company calling itself ""ZAP Solutions."" It promised that if he invested $30,000, he'd soon have $368,000 in returns. It sounded like a smart move. Like many victims, Joe believed the pitch because it seemed professional and legitimate.
But soon he was led deeper into a trap. Each ""short-term investment"" required another wire transfer. Before he knew it, Joe had sent every penny, his 401K, IRA and other investments.
The moment Joe was locked out of his account, panic set in. The scammers demanded more money to ""reactivate"" it. By the end, Joe had lost $228,000.
His mother, Carol, was devastated when she found out.
""I was shocked,"" she said. ""He showed us the screenshots, the messages. He emptied everything.""
Joe and his family filed apolice reportwith local authorities and contacted the FBI. But, according to officers, recovery is unlikely.
""They told us there's no way to get it back,"" Carol said. ""These cyberstalkers move the money too fast.""
Joe's story isn't unique. The FBI reports that cybercriminals have stolen more than $50 billion from Americans in just five years. Scammers prey on emotion, targeting people who are hopeful, lonely or in transition.
""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is,"" Joe said, stating a phrase we all should remember.
Staying safe starts with awareness and consistent action. Cybercriminals are getting more creative, so protecting your finances means staying alert every step of the way. Follow these proven steps to safeguard your accounts and identity.
Always verify any investment opportunity before sending money. Look up the company through official government or financial websites, such as the SEC's Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database or FINRA's BrokerCheck. Read reviews, confirm licenses and search for scam alerts online.
If a text,emailor social media message promises high returns, stop and think. Legitimate firms never cold-contact people about investment offers. Delete suspicious messages immediately and never click on links from unknown sources. Install and regularly update strong antivirus software on all your devices. This can block phishing attempts, malicious downloads, and fake investment platforms designed to steal your data.
The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-house-hopeful-vows-help-working-class-despite-record-hiking-taxes,Dem House hopeful vows to help working class despite record of hiking taxes,"Country star John Rich of the music duo Big & Rich spoke with Fox News Digital about his endorsement of Jody Barrett in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District.
FIRST ON FOX:A Tennessee Democratic state representative running for Congress who has been likened to Zohran Mamdani claims she is running to make life better for the working class, but her voting record tells a different story.
Tennessee state Rep.Aftyn Behn,D-District 51, who is running to replace Mark Green, the departing congressman from Tennessee's 7th Congressional District, voted no last year on a bill that would have resulted in a $400 million tax cut for certain Tennessee small businesses, including potential refunds of up to $1.5 billion.
Behn also rallied against Republicans' H.R. 1, the so-called ""big, beautiful bill,"" which extended Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts that, without, could've meant a nearly $4,000 increase for taxpayers in her district.
Earlier this year, Behn voted against a statewide budget bill that would have added tens of millions to the state's rainy day fund, which would have effectively padded the state's coffers so that, in times of low revenue, taxes won't need to be increased so much. That same budget bill would have also allocated millions for volunteer fire departments, senior centers, emergency medical services,teacher bonusesand other public safety funding.
TRUMP LOOMS LARGE OVER SPECIAL ELECTION PRIMARY IN DEEP RED CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

""A pissed-off social worker, Aftyn has seen firsthand how broken systems fail the very people they’re meant to protect,"" Behn's campaign website states. ""She’s now running for Congress after the so-called ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ passed — a giveaway to the wealthy that codified the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in American history.""
However, according to estimates from the Tax Foundation, if Trump's 2017 tax cuts had expired, residents inTennessee's 7th Congressional District,whom Behn wants to represent, would have seen an increase in their taxes of approximately $3,717 per taxpayer.
""To win, Democrats need to focus on what really matters — making life more affordable for working people,"" Behn said after the bill's passage. ""Washington Republicans did the opposite by passing this #BigBullsh--Bill. Gutting healthcare and giving handouts to billionaires.""
TENNESSEE SUED OVER LIMITED ACCESS TO EXECUTIONS AS MEDIA DEMAND TRANSPARENCY
Even The New York Times has admitted that independent analyses showed Trump's 2017 tax cuts ""have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law.""

Last year, Behn also voted against a bill that the Tennessee General Assembly Fiscal Review Committee estimated would provide over $1.5 billion in tax refunds for small business owners in the state. It also would have reduced a combined yearly tax burden for Tennessee business owners of about $400 million.
Simultaneously, Behn voted against Tennessee's 2025-2026 fiscal year budget that included a big increase to the state's rainy day fund, which is used by state governments during periods of low revenue. The same budget bill also included community funding for services like volunteer fire departments, emergency medical services and rescue squads, senior centers, teacher bonuses, school security and more.
During Behn's time in the state legislature, she also worked to repeal the grocery tax in Tennessee, claiming it would put money back into the pockets of hard-working Tennesseans year round. However, according to Republicans, the move would create a business enterprise tax,raising taxeson small businesses by about $800 million.

Fox News Digital reached out repeatedly to Behn's campaign for comment but did not hear back.
""Aftyn Behn’s policies would skyrocket the cost of living even more for hardworking Tennesseans,"" Behn's Republican opponent, Trump-backedMatt Van Epps,said. ""Aftyn has repeatedly voted against tax cuts and proposed new taxes, taking more money from your pocket. I’ll always fight to lower taxes and bring down costs so that working families can get ahead.""
Inlocal media reports,Behn has been compared to Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayor-elect and self-proclaimed socialist, and the Dickson County Democratic Party described Behn as ""our very own AOC of TN,"" a reference to U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.
""His message is one of helping working families across New York. My message is one of helping working families across Tennessee,"" Behn said about Mamdaniduring the appearance on CNN. ""We need to go back to pocketbook issues, especially in states like Tennessee where people are living unaffordable lives and suffering as a result of Republican policies.""",11/8/2025
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-justices-show-skepticism-trumps-emergency-tariff-powers-during-oral-arguments,Trump’s own SCOTUS picks could wind up hurting him on tariffs,"Legal fellow Brent Skorup says the president’s use of emergency tariffs goes beyond what IEEPA allows in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.
The Supreme Court on Wednesday heard oral arguments in a case centered on PresidentDonald Trump’s use of an emergency law to enact his sweeping ""Liberation Day"" tariffs, and even Trump-appointed justices appeared skeptical of the administration’s arguments.
Several questions from conservative justices, particularly Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett, suggested uncertainty about allowing Trump to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to enact his steep 10% tariffs on most imports. A ruling against the administration would deliver a major blow to Trump's signature economic policy.
The IEEPA law gives the president broad economic powers in the event of a national emergency tied to foreign threats, and Trump declared the trade deficit such an emergency to impose tariffs via executive order earlier this year. But the law does not mention the word ""tariffs"" or ""taxes"" — a major sticking point in both this week’s oral arguments and the lower court’s earlier review of the case.
Most of the justices’ questions focused on a single phrase in the law — the power to ""regulate importation"" during a national emergency — and whether that phrase grants Trump the authority he claims. Several justices seemed wary of a reading that could hand Congress’ Article I power over revenue and taxation to the executive branch.

This includedTrump’s appointees, who appeared to struggle with separation-of-powers issues that could vastly expand presidential authority — not only for Trump but for his successors as well.
Barrett, in particular, pressed U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer on this, asking: ""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase — together with ‘regulate importation’ — has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?""
Gorsuch later asked Sauer about his ""theory of the Constitution"" and ""major questions doctrine,"" indicating concern about separation-of-powers issues and granting too much power to the executive.

Nov. 5, 2025.(Maxine Wallace/The Washington Post via Getty Images)
""What would prohibit Congress from abdicating all responsibility to regulate foreign commerce or declare war to the president?"" Gorsuch asked Sauer.
Sauer repeatedly argued that a ""regulatory tariff"" is not a tax and that the power to raise revenue was ""only incidental,"" even asthe White House has celebratedthat Trump's tariff revenues exceeded $100 billion this year.
Challengers, including private entities and Democratic-led states, argue that Congress must clearly state when it wants presidents to have the authority to implement tariffs. In court filings, they pointed to laws such as Section 232 (national security trade measures) and Section 301 (retaliation for unfair trade) as times when Congress expressly gave tariff powers to the president. By contrast, IEEPA has been used for embargoes, asset freezes and licensing but never across-the-board tariffs. The last time the Court permitted a delegation of tariff powers to the president, in Algonquin SNG v. FEA (1976), it relied on Section 232 because Congress put that authority plainly in the statute. Challengers say there is no comparable language in IEEPA.
The liberal justices on the Court signaled that without clear words from Congress, IEEPA cannot provide Trump with tariff authority. After a previous Supreme Court decision in Loper Bright v. Raimondo (2024), courts no longer give federal agencies the benefit of the doubt when interpreting vague laws. And under the ""major questions"" doctrine referred to by Gorsuch and other justices, large, economy-wide actions like Trump's tariffs need a plain, specific grant from Congress.

Court watchers and legal experts said after arguments that a Trump administration win could be more difficult than expected, though each cautioned it is hard to draw conclusions from roughly two hours of oral arguments — a fraction of the total time justices spend reviewing a case.
Jonathan Turley, a law professor and Fox News contributor, said in ablog postthat the justices ""were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers.""
""However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration,"" Turley added.

Jack Goldsmith, a former assistant attorney general in theGeorge W. Bushadministration, did not go quite as far.
""I think that it is fair to say that the justices the government needs to win the case — Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett — asked the government very hard questions that did express skepticism about important elements of its case,"" Goldsmith said in aNew York Times interview.
""But they also asked the other side very hard questions. I do not think any of these three tipped off their hands definitively. I did not find anything terribly surprising in the questions.""

Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the CATO Institute, told Fox News Digital in an emailed statement that members of the Court seemed uncomfortable with expanding presidential power over tariffs.
""Most justices appeared attentive to the risks of deferring to a president's interpretation of an ambiguous statute and the executive branch ‘discovering’ new powers in old statutes,"" Skorup said.
""The justices were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers. However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration.""

(Credit: Nicholas Ballasy for Fox News Digital)
Democratic lawmakers deflected questions on why the stock market has had success under PresidentDonald Trumpin spite of their dark predictions on the administration’s tariffs while speaking with Fox News Digital on Capitol Hill.
Some downplayed the market’s success, indicating that it has no bearing on the country’s trueeconomic pulse.
Asked by Fox News Digital why the stock market is still doing well if Trump’s tariffs are hurting the economy, Sen.Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., shot back, ""The stock market is not the economy.""
She insisted that because of the tariffs, Americans ""are feeling price crunch when they go to the grocery store, prices are high.""
""The tariffs are a cause of that. The tariffs or taxes on Americans,"" she said. ""And that's why those prices are higher. And that is why I fought against it.""

Progressive Rep.Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., told Fox News Digital that she believes the stock market is only doing well ""because the billionaires are continuing to do well.""
""Corporations gotmassive tax breaks, $7 billion in tax breaks in the big, bad betrayal bill,"" said Jayapal. ""That's why the stock market's doing well, because the stock is really, you know, a lot of those large companies feel like they're doing just fine, they're continuing to get huge tax breaks.""
Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., said that ""no matter what the stock market is saying, [Americans] are seeing the cost of groceries have not gone down. They are seeing that health care costs have become really exorbitant. They can't afford it. They can’t afford the cost of goods.""
""That is what they expect us to respond to, is how it is affecting them and their everyday lives. And that's what I am here and focused on doing,"" she went on.
Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., told Fox News Digital that ""everybody in America knows that the price of goods subject to the tariffs are higher.""
""The stock market matters to a lot of folks, but prices matter the most to people. And right now, people are hurting because of Trump's economic policies, including the tariffs,"" he said. ""This is not what Democrats are saying. It's just a fact that tariffs are costing consumers thousands of dollars.""
The Trump administration, meanwhile, has blamed the Biden administration for the persistent high prices at grocery stores rather than the tariffs.
'60 MINUTES' SEGMENT COMPARES TRUMP ECONOMY TO 1929 STOCK CRASH, CLAIMS CEOS TOO 'NERVOUS' TO SPEAK OUT

On Friday, White House Press SecretaryKaroline Leavittposted on X, urging Americans to ""TRUST IN TRUMP"" and saying that the president’s ""pro-growth policies are a proven formula to Make America Affordable Again. They worked in his first term, and they are slowly but surely working now.""
""President Trump and his entire Administration, from the NEC to Treasury to USDA, are working hard every day to address the affordability issues created byJoe Biden, who unleashed the worst inflation crisis in modern American history — something the liberal media barely blamed the Democrats for over the past 4 years.""
Leavitt wrote that ""the price of eggs, butter, ice cream, fresh fruit, cereal, fish, seafood, rice, pasta, and ham are all falling,"" adding that ""the best is yet to come.""
Back on Capitol Hill, Sen. John Hoeven, R-N.D., echoed this sentiment, saying, ""The point that [Democrats] are missing is that [Trump] is trying to get us better terms from all the countries that we export to, trying to get a level playing field, trying to grow our exports.""
""You have to separate the short term from what's going to happen over time,"" he explained. ""They're trying to make the argument in the short term because of some of the challenges of getting other countries to play fair.""
""You have to work through this process,"" Hoeven went on. ""The president did it in his first term, and we ended up with huge sales to China and other places, and that helped our ag markets and our other exports. And so, it's the same thing again; he is working to make sure we get better trade terms for all of our manufacturers, processors, farmers, and everyone else. But it doesn't happen in one day, it doesn't happen overnight.""

Fetterman added that ""now it seems like the Supreme Court might be voting against that now. So ultimately, their opinion counts a lot more than mine.""
Faced with the question of why the market continues to perform well despite the tariffs, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., answered, ""One thing I’ve learned is not to try to predict or analyze the stock market.""

""Karoline, the prime minister would like you to work for him in Hungary,"" Trump said Friday after Orban was seen leaning toward Trump and asking him, ""Can I get her for us?""
The scene unfolded after Trump called Leavitt into Cabinet room at the White House, where Trump and Orban were holding a bilateral meeting to discuss Hungarian energy and trade.

Trump shot back:""I talked about it. When did I not want to talk about it? I talk about it all the time. We are much better than Biden and all of them now.""
Trump called out to Leavitt amid his response, with her arriving at the meeting shortly after.
""They said, 'Oh, I don't want to talk about affordability.' The reason I don't want to talk about affordability is because everybody knows that it's far less expensive under Trump than it was under SleepyJoe Biden,""Trump said. ""And the prices are way down.""
Leavitt arrived to the meeting and promptly launched a takedown on the media for their coverage of theeconomy.

""It's very unfortunate that the reporters in this room refused to address, sir, what you just said, which is that you inherited the worstinflation crisisin modern American history, and you are fixing it in 10 short months,"" Leavitt said. ""And your entire administration has been tasked with this effort, from Treasury Department to Agriculture Department to the National Economic Council right here at the White House, they are slashing regulation. He signed the largest middle class tax cut in six months. In six months, in record time. Putting more money back into the American people's pockets.""

Trump said the media has ""refused"" to cover the economic wins because the reporters are ""fake news,"" before Orban interjected that he would like to hire Leavitt.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-reveals-over-100-investigations-into-h-1b-abuses-as-it-pledges-every-resource-to-protect-us-jobs,Trump admin reveals over 100 investigations into H-1B abuses as it pledges 'every resource' to protect US jobs,"Fox News Digital spoke to Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello about how the visa program needs to be fixed to give American workers more opportunity.
FIRST ON FOX:The Department of Labor revealed it has launched at least 175 ongoing investigations targeting potential abuses within the H-1B visa program as part of its mission to protect American jobs and ensure only necessary foreign workers are employed in the U.S.
The DOL launched Project Firewall in September to ensure that employers prioritize qualified Americans for job positions and do not abuse the H1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations.
The aggressive federal crackdown on potential abuse of the program includes Labor SecretaryLori Chavez-DeRemerpersonally certifying the initiation of investigations — which is a mechanism that the department has never used before, Fox Digital learned.
""The Labor Department is using every resource currently at our disposal to put a stop to H-1B visa abuse, and for the first time, I am personally certifying investigations into suspected violations to better protect American jobs,"" Chavez-DeRemer told Fox News Digital in a statement.
TRUMP’S H-1B VISA REFORM PLAN NEEDS TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST

""Under the leadership of President Trump, we will continue to invest in our workforce, ensuring high-skilled job opportunities go to American workers first.""
The DOL's September announcement was launched the same day PresidentDonald Trumpsigned a proclamation that imposed a $100,000 one-time fee on H-1B visa petitions. The White House previously told Fox News Digital that the fee works to prevent ""companies from spamming the system and driving down wages"" with cheap foreign labor, while simultaneously promoting ""American businesses who actually want to bring high-skilled workers"" to the U.S.
The Department of Labor could not provide details on the specifics of the 175 current investigations, which account for over $15 million in calculated back wages to workers, but reported to Fox Digital that it has uncovered a bounty of concerns.
The investigations have uncovered that some foreign workers with advanced degrees are paid far less than what's promoted in a job description, which the DOL said drives down wages for visa-holders and American workers alike, while also forcing American employees with the same qualification to accept lower wages in order to stay competitive.
Other investigations found that employers did not even notify U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services when an H-1B visa holder was terminated, or found significant lag times between a termination and an employer notifying the agency that oversees the U.S.'s immigration system.

At the heart of other investigations, Fox News Digital learned, are documents filed by employers with the DOL in order to employ H-1B holders, as well as other visa programs, called Labor Condition Applications (LCA). Employers are required to give notice to American workers before hiring H-IB workers when filing an LCA, which is part of a larger effort to ensure American workers get first dibs on jobs, as well as accurately describe the job an employee will work and detailing the employee's wage.
Investigators found that work sites listed on the LCA documents did not exist, or that workers were unaware of the jobs they were supposedly assigned to perform as laid out in the applications. Other investigations found that employees were paid less than what was detailed in an LCA, or that employers were sloppily copying and pasting job notices for American workers that had little connection to the job described in the LCA.

Other investigations found some employees took part in ""benching,"" which is when H-1B visa holders are not paid anything when they are in-between active work projects, Fox Digital found.
Many tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. One of the reasons for this is that foreign workers are tied to their respective employers via the H-1B visa — as a company is required to sponsor the visa — and therefore quitting the job could ultimately see foreign workers losing their visa and their ability to legally remain in the country.
Justin Vianello, CEO of Skillstorm,told Fox News Digitallast month that the work visa program in the United States is a ""three-headed monster"" that needs to be drastically reformed in order to not leave American workers behind.
Earlier this year, the Trump administrationunveiled a proposaldesigned to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came just days after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.
The $100,000 fee — a one-time charge applying only to new H-1B petitions — will take effect in the next annual lottery, the system the U.S. government uses to select applications once the annual visa cap is reached.
""The whole idea is no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee, so it’s just not [economical],"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said as Trump signed the order.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-virginia-cities-hot-seat-as-trump-aligned-group-demands-doj-probe-dei-mandates,Top Virginia cities in the hot seat as Trump-aligned group demands DOJ probe of DEI mandates,"Fox News host Jesse Watters reacts to former President Barack Obama's return to the political spotlight on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’
FIRST ON FOX:A Trump-aligned legal group is ramping up its pressure campaign targeting big blue cities violating President Donald Trump's Executive Orders and federal civil rights law by continuing to embeddiversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)into their practices.
America First Legal (AFL) sent three more civil rights complaints to the Department of Justice's Office of Civil Rights this week requesting it investigate the Virginia cities of Richmond, Alexandria and Arlington for violating Title VI and Title VII of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as Trump's Executive Orders on discriminatory DEI initiatives, via its city and county programs, hiring, and public services.
AFL argues the cities receive federal grant money and distribute it across their city governments in various departments and for multiple purposes, opening them up to federal scrutiny.
The civil rights complaint letters to theJustice Departmentfollow the agency's decision to launch an investigation into the city of Austin for similar DEI violations, which was followed by AFL's first complaint letter to the Justice Department's Office of Civil Rights earlier this month, asking the agency to investigate Seattle over its allegedly discriminatory DEI practices. AFL filed a complaint against Portland a few days later as well, alleging similar accusations.

""Despite these federal civil rights laws, these jurisdictions openly engage in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (""DEI"") policies in their respective jurisdictions, ordering local departments to implement discriminatory ‘equity’ programs and directives,"" an AFL press release states. ""Race-based policies do not create justice—they destroy it. As Virginia lurches to the Left, America First Legal will continue leading the fight to ensure that federal funds never support programs that divide citizens, weaken public safety, or erode the rule of law.""
In AFL's complaint, the legal watchdog accuses the City of Richmond of creating a ""government-wide pattern or practice of discrimination"" by embedding racial equity in every department. The complaint cites hiring materials embedded with discriminatory themes, mandatory DEI training, Richmond's Equity Agenda, and the capital city's establishment of an Office of Equity and Inclusion, which AFL claims to have an aim to empower ""only certain people and communities wholly based on race,"" rather than merit.
Richmond’s fiscal year budgets reportedly measured department performance by the percentage of employees completing ""equity training,"" with a stated goal of 100% participation. Meanwhile, AFL also cited Richmond's ""Climate Equity Action Plan"" and ""Racial Equity and Environmental Justice (REEJ) program,"" which the group accuses of funneling resources to only certain racial groups.

Alexandria's Office of Race and Social Equity (RASE), AFL alleges, serves to embed ""racial and social equity into all city policies, programs, decisions, and environments"" and ensure city policies and programs ""are discussed and evaluated through a racial and social justice lens.""
In particular, AFL calls out Alexandria's Police Department's development of a ""Racial Equity Plan,"" which the complaint claims has instructions for the police department ""to make efforts in creating a diverse workforce"" with the goal of ""improv[ing] the demographic representation"" through recruitment. A similar ""strategic plan"" from the city's fire department reportedly pushes similar hiring preferences on its department as well, AFL alleges.

Arlington, meanwhile, is accused of establishing an ""Affirmative Action Plan,"" which AFL says includes ""underutilization goals"" based on race for specific job groups. These goals include increasing minority representation in the ""Senior Administrators"" job group from 35.23% to 45%, and minority representation in""Police Officers""from 27.38% to 38%, according to AFL's complaint.
To prove the real-life consequences of these cities' policies, AFL's complaint against Arlington pointed to an incident at a local public school from last year.

""In September 2024, a male sex offender was permitted to use the girls’ locker room at Washington Liberty High School in Arlington County for months because he claimed to be transgender—a direct result of the County’s policy allowing individuals to use facilities based on their claimed ‘gender identity.’ The individual ultimately exposed his genitals to a 9-year-old girl,"" AFL's complaint to the Department of Justice chronicles. ""This incident demonstrates how Arlington County’s race- and sex-conscious policies not only violate federal civil rights law but also compromise student safety.""
Last month, AFL reached a settlement with theCity of Philadelphiathat began in 2019 over alleged race- and sex-based quotas and ""discriminatory"" union-membership requirements in public contracting. Under the settlement, the City of Philadelphia agreed to rewrite its ""Project Labor Agreements,"" which AFL said penalized city contractors that refused to abide by its DEI mandates. Under the settlement, the city was compelled to make previous workforce diversity goals ""strictly aspirational"" and end ""quotas or mandatory minimums.""",11/6/2025
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/jonathan-turley-supreme-court-ruling-trump-tariffs-comes-down-numbers-game,JONATHAN TURLEY: Supreme Court ruling on Trump tariffs comes down to a numbers game,"U.S. Trade Representative Amb. Jamieson Greer addresses the legal uniqueness of the word ‘tariff’ on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’
The oral argument on Nov. 5 for theTrump tariffswas fascinating as justices struggled with the knotty question of whether a president has the sweeping authority claimed by President Donald Trump under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The justices were skeptical and uncomfortable with the claim of authority, and the odds still favored the challengers. However, there is a real chance of a fractured decision that could still produce an effective win for the administration.
First, the counsel. I was highly impressed by the performance of Solicitor General John Sauer, who did a brilliant job in weaving historical and precedential arguments in favor of the tariffs. He had a tough case and at times a tough audience, but maintained a coherent and consistent position.
Many were surprised that the challengers selected the liberal firebrand Neil Katyal for counsel on the other side. Kavanaugh even made a quip about the incongruity of Katyal arguing for issues like non-delegation. Katyal struggled at points andJustice Amy Coney Barrettbashed him once for seemingly flipping his position in oral argument. However, Katyal made the key points against the claim of statutory and constitutional authority.
TRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'
Overall, the administration faced worrisome moments in the argument, with Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly referring to tariffs as a clear ""tax"" and Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raising the ""major questions doctrine."" Neither works well for the administration. If this is a tax, it is more likely viewed as a usurpation of Congress' inherent tax authority.

However, the head counting becomes more difficult as you comb through the specific questions of the justices.
We begin with the clear votes in favor of the challengers by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Indeed, at times, both justices seemed to take on the role of counsel in clarifying the confusion left by the challengers and directing them back to what they viewed as more solid ground.
SUPREME COURT TO WEIGH TRUMP TARIFF POWERS IN BLOCKBUSTER CASE
Justice Elena Kagan, as usual, was more circumspect, but still clearly leaning against the administration.
That leaves two more votes to reject the tariffs.
The most obvious candidate would be Barrett, who hit Sauer hard with questions on the largely unprecedented scope of the Trump tariffs. Much of this turned on the meaning of the terms ""regulate importation"" in IEEPA. Barrett asked pointedly: ""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase, together with ‘regulate importation,’ has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?""
Sauer stressed that a predecessor law was used in this manner, but Barrett repeatedly returned and was clearly not satisfied. At one point, Sotomayor (prematurely, in my view) snapped at Sauer and said, ""just answer the justice’s question.""
TRUMP WARNS SUPREME COURT TARIFF SHOWDOWN IS 'LIFE OR DEATH' FOR AMERICA
Nevertheless, Barrett offered the administration some hope in their questioning of the challengers.
She zeroed in on the fact that licenses are within the power of the president:

JUSTICE BARRETT: ""So, this license thing is important to me. And do you agree that pursuant to IEEPA, the president could impose — could regulate commerce by imposing a license fee?""
Katyal seemed to struggle with this when Barrett noted that he had previously stated there is little difference between a license and a tariff. Barrett said that, if so, a president could regulate commerce in the same way with a license fee.
SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY
MR. KATYAL: ""Not a fee. So, I should have said this earlier. But license is different from a licensing fee. IEEPA and TWEA authorize licenses, not license fees. And no president has ever charged, to my knowledge, fees under those two statutes for the licenses. So, fee is impermissible. License is OK.""
JUSTICE BARRETT: ""But I thought you conceded to Justice Gorsuch there was no difference between a tariff and a licensing fee functionally.""
Nevertheless, Barrett offered the administration some hope in their questioning of the challengers.
MR. KATYAL: ""Well, if the — if the licensing fee is just to — I didn't concede that.""
JUSTICE BARRETT: ""OK.""
Barrett kept telling Katyal that she was not following his arguments. Barrett also seemed intrigued by the incongruity that a president could use embargoes or quotas to effectively shut down trade entirely, so why shouldn't he be allowed to use the lesser of the powers?
The fifth vote could come from Gorsuch, but again, the rationales were strikingly different from those of the other justices.
Gorsuch clearly viewed the delegation of the authority as problematic and also raised the ""major questions doctrine."" However, he was also the most effective in hammering Katyal on plain meaning arguments, noting the verb ""regulate"" is ""capacious.""
If Gorsuch were to argue that the delegation is unconstitutional, he may find himself in the minority, but could then give the president the statutory argument on the broad implications of ""regulate importation.""

Justice Brett Kavanaugh was the most useful for the administration in returning to the history ofPresident Richard Nixon's global 10% tariff, under the Trading with the Enemy Act, the predecessor of IEEPA.
Overall, the administration faced worrisome moments in the argument, with Chief Justice John Roberts repeatedly referring to tariffs as a clear ""tax"" and Justice Neil Gorsuch repeatedly raising the ""major questions doctrine.""
He also highlighted how, in FEA v. Algonquin SNG (1976), the court allowed the exercise of tariff powers. At one point, he slammed Katyal's effort to rewrite the decision and said, ""Algonquin didn't have anything like that, but keep going.""

There is a chance that the challengers could eke out a majority with Barrett and possibly another conservative, such as Gorsuch or Roberts. However, it is also possible that, when the justices delve into the details, they may find a fragmented rationale that ultimately works to the advantage of the administration.
In the meantime,Congress may want to get startedin addressing what Barrett described as ""the mess"" of reimbursement if the tariffs were found to be unlawful.

The economy, the issue that hurt Democrats in the 2024 elections, gave them a major boost in this year's ballot box showdowns.
One year after deep concerns over inflation helped Republicans win back the White House and Senate and keep their House majority, Democrats say their convincing double-digit victories in2025's only two electionsfor governor came down to affordability, the issue they repeatedly spotlighted on this year's campaign trail.
Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper said that Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and former Rep. Abigail Spanbergerof Virginia, the two Democratic gubernatorial nominees that overperformed the public opinion polls as they cruised to Election Night victories in the blue-leaning states, ""stayed laser focused on the economy,"" and ""talked about it all day, every day.""
The numbers appear to back them up.

According to the Fox News Voter Poll conducted Oct. 22 through Election Day, the economy was by far the top issue for Virginia voters — with close to half ranking it as the most important. Those voters broke significantly for Spanberger.
Andin New Jersey, the economy was the second most pressing issue, following taxes, according to the poll. And Sherrill won those voters by a 30-point margin.

PresidentDonald Trump, in his first post-2025 election interview, told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday that on inflation, ""We've done so much…Energy is way down … We're going to have $2 gasoline. I did that. That brings everything else down. Groceries are way down, other than beef. Now, beef is going to come down …The fact is, we have prices way down.""
And the president argued in his ""Special Report"" interview that it's more of a messaging problem for the GOP.
""As Republicans, you have to talk about it,"" Trump said.
Veteran Republican strategist Ryan Williams told Fox News Digital that ""affordability has been a major issue since inflation spiked after the pandemic. President Biden wasn’t able to contain inflation and the Democrats suffered at the polls in 2024. President Trump has had a year in office. He has been able to reduce the rate of inflation. There’s more work to do. Things don’t change overnight.""
But Ryan added that ""voters in off-year elections tend to point the finger at the party in power. So Republicans will need to sharpen their message.""
Seasoned Democratic strategist Chris Moyer highlighted that ""Democrats flipped the script from 2024 and focused like a laser on affordability, whether that was healthcare, groceries, electricity, utility bills. That proved to be effective, as voters are still very much focused on the cost of living.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/barrett-sotomayor-tag-team-interrogation-trump-lawyer-tariff-powers,Barrett and Sotomayor tag-team interrogation of Trump lawyer on tariff powers,"Justice Amy Coney Barrett pressed Solicitor General John Sauer on President Donald Trump’s tariff authority, citing precedent, while Justice Sonia Sotomayor urged him to answer Barrett's questions directly during Supreme Court oral arguments.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett had pointed questions Wednesday about the lawDonald Trumpinvoked to impose global tariffs, joining several other justices on the right and left in voicing skepticism about the president’s ability to use a tool he has deemed critical to carrying out his economic agenda.
Solicitor General John Sauer repeatedly argued during the lengthy 2½-hour oral arguments that the emergency law Trump used to enact the tariffs for nearly every U.S. trading partner contained language about regulating imports, which Sauer said included using tariffs. The relevant statute permits the president to ""regulate … nullify [and] void … importation,"" but it does not use the word ""tariff."" Barrett pressed Sauer on this point.
""Can you point to any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together, ‘regulate importation,’ has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority?"" Barrett, a Trump appointee, asked.
SUPREME COURT PREPARES TO CONFRONT MONUMENTAL CASE OVER TRUMP EXECUTIVE POWER AND TARIFF AUTHORITY

Sauer noted one other trade law that had served as a precursor to the emergency law in question, but Barrett appeared unconvinced, repeating her question as Sauer failed to offer direct responses.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, an Obama appointee, interjected, asking Sauer to ""just answer the justice’s question.""
Sotomayor at one point noted that no president has ever used the emergency law, known as the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, to impose tariffs, though Sauer argued that President Richard Nixon’s tariffs were used that way even if the IEEPA did not exist at that stage.
""It's a congressional power, not a presidential power to tax,"" Sotomayor said. ""And you want to say tariffs are not taxes. But that's exactly what they are. They're generating money from American citizens, revenue.""
The liberal justice noted thatCongresshas always used the phrase ""regulate and tax"" together, suggesting that the absence of any mention of tariffs or taxes in a law's language was deliberate and that Congress purposely did not grant that power to the president.
""Are you telling us that, with respect to its use of ‘regulate’ in other statutes, the taxing reference is superfluous? They didn’t need to do that?"" Sotomayor asked.

Both Barrett and Sotomayor also drilled down on other verbs in the statute, underscoring the absence of tariff powers.
""To me, things like ‘nullify’ and ‘void’ have definite meanings. I agree with you that ‘regulate’ is a broader term, but those words, I think, are powerful,"" Barrett said.
Sotomayor was more blunt: ""The verbs that accompany ‘regulate’ have nothing to do with raising revenues in the form of taxes.""
The case has become one of the most closely watched of the term and has presented a novel question to the high court that Trump framed this week as ""life or death.""
""Our Stock Market is consistently hitting Record Highs, and our Country has never been more respected than it is right now,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""A big part of this is the Economic Security created by Tariffs, and the Deals that we have negotiated because of them.""
Sauer told the justices that Trump views the trade deficit and opioid epidemic as ""country killing and not sustainable"" and that he has chosen to address them by using the IEEPA to impose tariffs. Sauer highlighted the success of the trade agreements Trump has made with top foreign competitors, likeChina, because of the president's tariff choices.
""Unwinding those agreements, [Trump] warns, would expose us to ruthless trade retaliation by far more aggressive countries and drive America from strength to failure with ruinous economic and national security consequences,"" Sauer said.
Sauer argued the emergency law gives the president the power to regulate importation and that ""the power to tariff is a core application of that,"" even if not explicitly stated in the law.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-weigh-trump-tariff-powers-blockbuster-case,Supreme Court weighs Trump tariff powers in blockbuster case,"Supreme Court justices hear a major challenge to Trump’s use of emergency powers to impose broad tariffs, a case that could reshape the balance of trade and presidential authority.
The Supreme Court weighed the legality of PresidentDonald Trump’s use of an emergency law to unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on most U.S. trading partners on Wednesday — a blockbuster case, and one that experts say stretches far beyond matters of economic policy.
At issue before the court is whether the president can use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose two sweeping sets of tariffs on most countries, including a 10% global tariff Trump announced in April and the higher so-called reciprocal tariffs imposed on nearly 50 countries. Trump said at the time that trade deficits amounted to ""the precipice of an economic and national-security crisis"" sufficient to trigger his powers under IEEPA.
Justices focused very little of their questions Wednesday on the economic impacts of Trump’s tariff plans. Rather, the majority of the time during oral arguments centered on the IEEPA statute at the heart of the case, its applicability to tariffs or taxation powers — and what guardrails, if any, exist to limit the whims of an executive, should the high court rule in Trump’s favor. The law in question authorizes the president to ""regulate … importation"" during a declared national emergency, but it does not mention the word ""tariffs.""
In arguments, the administration told justices that IEEPA's allows a president to ""regulate"" ""importation"" of goods, which they said is the practical equivalent of a ""tariff.""

But several conservative justices questioned that, saying a tariff amounted to a tax on consumers.
""Is the constitutional assignment of the taxing power to Congress, the power to reach into the pockets of the American people, just different?"" Justice Neil Gorsuch asked, referring back to the founding of the country.
Justice Amy Coney Barrett followed up, asking if there has ""ever been another instance in which a statute has used that language to confer the power"" that Trump seeks.
Other conservative justices questioned whether an ""economic equivalent"" to tariffs could be used by the president under the law, such as sanctions, embargos, licenses, and quotas.
The two consolidated cases, Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump and Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, mark the first time during Trump's second term that the Supreme Court will review his policies fully on its merits, rather than through the so-called shadow docket, where justices have often sided with the administration in granting temporary stays and other emergency actions.
Unlike other cases, this one also centers on an issue Trump considers to be the signature economic policy of his second term.
""Tomorrow’s United StatesSupreme Courtcase is, literally, LIFE OR DEATH for our country,"" Trump said in a post on social media Tuesday night, adding that, without it, the U.S. is ""virtually defenseless against other countries who have, for years, taken advantage of us.""
Lawyers for the Trump administration have argued in lower courts that the IEEPA allows a president to act in response to ""unusual and extraordinary threats"" and in cases where a national emergency has been declared. Trump has claimed that deep and ""sustained"" trade deficits amount to a national emergency that allows him to invoke IEEPA.
Plaintiffs counter that in the 50 years since its passage, the law has never been used by a president to impose tariffs and that permitting the president to do so would drastically expand his powers at the expense of other branches of government. They contended to lower courts that Trump’s use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration’s own admission, the trade deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, which they say undermines any claim of an ""unusual and extraordinary"" emergency.

Justices on Wednesday immediately jumped into what's known as the ""major question doctrine."" Plaintiffs in the case have repeatedly argued that Trump’s use of IEEPA violates the doctrine — which requires Congress to be explicit when it hands the executive branch powers to make decisions with a vast economic or political significance.
""Congress does not (and could not) use such vague terminology to grant the executive virtually unconstrained taxing power of such staggering economic effect — literally trillions of dollars — shouldered by American businesses and consumers,"" they told the court in an earlier briefing.
U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer acknowledged to the justices that IEEPA does not explicitly give an executive the power to regulate tariffs, though he argued that the power to tariff is ""the natural common sense inference"" of the 1977 law.
Justices pressed Sauer as to why Trump invoked IEEPA to impose his sweeping tariffs, noting that doing so would be the first time a president used the law to set import taxes on trading partners.
Barrett grilled Sauer at length on this issue, asking if he could point to ""any other place in the code or any other time in history where that phrase together — 'regulate importation' — has been used to confer tariff-imposing authority.""
They also noted that, unlike other statutes that delegate tariff authority to the president, IEEPA does not mention the word tariff, and some of the justices seemed skeptical of the administration's assertion that they do not need additional permission from Congress to use the law in such a sweeping manner.
TRUMP WARNS SUPREME COURT TARIFF SHOWDOWN IS ‘LIFE OR DEATH’ FOR AMERICA
Justice Elena Kagan pressed Sauer on the Trump administration's contention that IEEPA is only narrowly reviewable by the courts.
""We agree that it's a major power, but it's in the context of a statute that is explicitly conferring major powers,"" Sauer said. ""That the point of the statute is to confer major powers to address major questions — which are emergencies.""
""So it would be unusual to say, look at the statute, say we're not going to find a major power. Well, but the exercise of the power is to impose tariffs. ""
That prompted a follow-up question from Gorsuch, who asked, ""Could Congress delegate to the president the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations as he sees fit and collect duties as he sees fit?""
Gorsuch appeared skeptical of the administration's use of IEEPA, which would essentially cut out congressional oversight on the tariffs enacted under the law, and limit judicial review.
Barrett and Gorsuch used their time to ask about the balance of powers, and how Congress could ever get the tariff delegation back if it was allocated to Trump under IEEPA.
Both justices posed a string of pointed questions to Sauer on the broad latitude that would be granted to Trump under the law, and their skepticism could prove telling in how the court eventually decides the case.
It's unclear how the court might rule on the matter, though Trump's laser-focus on the case was on sharp display, including with the attendance of Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Neal Katyal, who helped argue the case on behalf of the plaintiffs, told justices Wednesday that Trump has ""torn up the entire tariff architecture.""
Chief Justice John Roberts pressed Katyal on the foreign policy issues at play, noting that, unlike taxes, tariffs deal explicitly with foreign powers — which could give the president more latitude to act.
""It implicates, very directly, the president’s foreign affairs power,"" Roberts noted at one point during the exchange.
Judges for lower appeals courts previously pressed lawyers for the administration to explain why Trump invoked IEEPA when there are other, more narrow statutes enacted by Congress to specifically deal with tariffs. These laws include certain caps on tariff amounts, as well as timeframes reviewable by Congress. IEEPA, however, does not mention the word tariffs at all.
Barrett and other justices nodded to this Wednesday in their own questions.
""Here, you’re talking about something that is exclusively committed to Congress in Article One,"" Katyal said. ""When you have delegations, I would say — even when you have delegations in some military cases and emergency statutes — they have all sorts of limits.""
Lower courts sided with plaintiffs from Democratic states and a coalition of small businesses against Trump, with a three-judge panel for the Court of International Trade ruling this summer that Trump's authorities under IEEPA are not ""unbounded.""
Appealing to the Supreme Court, the Justice Department has argued that ""denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses.""
Sauer said in an earlier court filing thatnullifying the tariffswould have ""catastrophic consequences"" for national security and global supply chains.
The original lawsuits were brought in part by two related third-generation family-owned businesses who make ""hands-on educational toys and products for children,"" according to legal briefs filed by Learning Resources and hand2mind's, whose lawsuit was one of two consolidated cases reviewed by the high court.
Their products are developed and manufactured partly in the U.S. About 60% of the assembly is outsourced overseas to several Asian countries, including China and Thailand.
Rick Woldenberg, CEO of the two Chicago-area companies founded by his grandfather more than a century ago, said that a Supreme Court ruling for the Trump administration could put him out of business, and predicted that the tariffs would increase from $2.3 million in 2024 to $100.2 million this year.
""I wish I had $100 million,"" he told Fox News in an interview. ""Honest to God, no exaggeration: It feels like the end of days.""
Woldenberg said Trump's call to return manufacturing back to the U.S. is not practical, at least for his small businesses.
""I have been looking for American manufacturers for a long time,"" he said, ""and I have come up with zero companies to partner with.""

Experts say the impact of this case could stretch far beyond tariffs. A ruling in Trump's favor could cement a broad precedent for future administrations, which could then invoke national emergencies as a pretext to act without congressional review on a wide range of issues.
Ultimately, ""this is a separation of powers issue,"" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel for the Liberty Justice Center and counsel for plaintiffs in one of the consolidated cases, told Fox News Digital in an interview.
""It's not about this president,"" he said, speaking on the eve of the oral arguments. ""It's about all presidents and the power that they have under the Constitution, and the powers that they don't have under the Constitution, and whether Congress can delegate those powers — and, if it does, how broad can those powers be?""
""Everybody should be concerned about that,"" he said. ""Because even if you like what the president is doing now, you might not like what a future president does with the same power.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/economic-anxiety-keys-dem-sweep-high-stakes-races-left-leverages-voter-frustration,Economic anxiety keys Dem sweep in high-stakes races as left leverages voter frustration,"‘Saturday in America' host Kayleigh McEnany disagrees with those calling New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mikie Sherrill a moderate and says people should be more concerned about Zohran Mamdani’s rise on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’
Democrats claimed victory in a trio of high-stakeselectionsthat largely focused on economic anxiety and affordability issues.
New Jersey Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill defeated Republicangubernatorialcandidate Jack Ciattarelli in the New Jersey governor's race, while former Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger defeated Republican challenger Winsome Earle-Sears in the Virginia gubernatorial race. In the Empire State, Democratic Socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani claimed victory over former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an Independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa.
The three sweeps come as Republicans worked to make inroads in the historically liberal or left-leaning jurisdictions, including campaigning on lowering taxes.
In all three elections, the economy and affordability were top concerns, according to polling data, with the liberal candidates leaning into blaming the White House for economic anxiety.

In New Jersey, voters reported that the state's notoriously high taxes and theeconomywere their top issues heading into the polling stations, according to Fox News Voter Poll data. In Virginia, half of voters reported that the economy was their top issue, more than double the number who reported healthcare as their top concern, according to Fox polling data.
In New York City, affordability was by far voters' top concern, according to Fox News Voter Poll data, with Mamdani notching a significant win over his challengers. Mamdani ran on policies such as city-run groceries to lower food costs, eliminating bus fares, implementing rent freezes on rent-stabilized units and other affordable housing proposals.
Voters responded by voting for Democrats following PresidentDonald Trump's decisive win over former Vice President Kamala Harris just more than a year ago in a federal election that also focused on the economy amid spiraling inflation woes.

Trump and other conservatives have railed against Mamdani as a ""communist"" who threatens New York City's massive economy and a symbol of American capitalism, while left-wing supporters have championed he will ease the cost burden on residents facing sky-high rent, taxes and food costs.

""Donald Trump needs to answer directly to Virginians on why he is actively cutting Virginia jobs and hurting the Virginia economy,"" Spanberger said in October. ""The Trump Administration has taken a sledgehammer approach to governing that has hurt Virginia’s workers, businesses, and economy.""
Sherrill pitched the current economy as a ""catastrophe,"" including claiming Trump's tariffs would be disastrous.

""Donald Trump just implemented the biggest tax increase in my lifetime — an economic catastrophe for New Jersey families,"" Sherrill said in April as Trump announced increased tariffs on foreign nations. ""This will raise costs to the tune of almost $4,000 per year, and many companies have already announced layoffs. No wonder the Wall Street Journal called it the ‘dumbest trade war in history.'""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-energy-company-hot-seat-after-bald-eagles-knocked-out-of-skies,Green energy company in the hot seat after bald eagles knocked out of the skies,"Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum discusses the looming deadline for President Donald Trump's ‘big, beautiful bill’ and the issues with the ‘green new scam’ on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’
FIRST ON FOX:The Trump Department of the Interior is fining agreen energycompany over $30,000 after their wind turbines knocked two American bald eagles out of the sky, according to a violation notice reviewed by Fox News Digital.
The notice reveals that theU.S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceis proposing a fine of $32,340 against Ørsted Onshore North America after two bald eagles were discovered dead near wind turbines in Plum Creek, Nebraska, and Lincoln Land, Illinois. The violation notice says the company violated the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act by killing the eagles without what is called an ""incidental take permit.""
The first bald eagle was discovered dead in March 2024 near a turbine at Ørsted’s Plum Creek facility in Wayne County, Nebraska. The eagle’s remains were taken to the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory for a necropsy, at which it was determined the fatality was caused by a collision with a wind turbine.
A year later, another bald eagle was found dead on April 18, just 200 yards from a turbine in Lincoln Land, Illinois. The necropsy results similarly showed that the eagle’s death was consistent with a wind turbine collision.

Because the Ørsted facilities did not have permits to kill the eagles, the Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing civil penalties of $16,170 per violation, totaling $32,340. The bureau is giving Ørsted 45 days to respond to the notice before sealing the penalties.
A spokesperson for the Plum Creek Wind and Lincoln Land Wind facilities told Fox News Digital that Ørsted received the letter issued by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on October 29 and the company ""will continue to engage and cooperate with USFWS on this matter.""
A subsidiary of Danish clean energy conglomerate Ørsted A/S, Ørsted Onshore operates 13 wind farms across the country. According to its website, Ørsted A/S is a global clean energy leader that develops, constructs, and operates offshore and land-based wind farms, solar farms, energy storage facilities, and bioenergy plants. Ørsted also operates offshore wind farms across the globe, including in the U.S.

Ørsted was one of the companies touted by the Biden White House as an example of its successful clean energy goals and economic plan. The company’s controversial offshore projects in New Jersey, Ocean Wind 1 and Ocean Wind 2, made headlines in 2023 and were ultimately canceled due to economic factors, delivering a blow to former President Joe Biden's green energy goals.
The company’s website states that its mission is to ""create a world that runs entirely on green energy.""
""We are building and shaping America’s clean energy industry, creating jobs, boosting economies, partnering with local communities, and conserving nature,"" a statement on Ørsted’s website says.
The violation notice states that though Ørsted does not have any prior wildlife violations, it says the company continued to not hold an eagle take permit despite realizing the danger its turbines presented to airborne wildlife after the first eagle was killed in 2024. It also notes that Ørsted showed good faith by voluntarily notifying the bureau of the kills and cooperating with instructions to preserve the carcasses.

Nonetheless, the notice reads that ""the gravity of these violations is serious,"" noting that ""while bald eagle numbers have increased markedly from pre-listing lows, the species still faces myriad threats from humans.""

""When you think about the green new scam, it was pro-China and it's anti-American and it's also unaffordable and unreliable,"" Burgum said onJesse Watters Primetimein June.

After years of sizzling sales, America's pizza business is now cooling off.
Once a takeout and delivery staple, thepizza industryis struggling to keep up with shifting consumer habits — driven by delivery apps that now offer everything from sushi to steak.
Domino’s, once a pizza powerhouse, saw U.S. sales rise 5.2% last quarter, according tothe Food Institute— a modest uptick that hasn't reversed years of slowing growth.

Rival chains aren't faring much better, according to reports.
Pizza Hut has seen sales fall for two straight years, according to Restaurant Dive, while Papa Johns has endured a ""lost decade"" with shares down more than 60% since early 2022.
Papa Johns' same-store sales fell 3% in early 2025, according to PMQ Pizza Media, despite the company's efforts to modernize and even explore a sale to aprivate equity firm.

The pandemic was a short-lived golden age for pizza. Between 2020 and 2021, Papa Johns' same-store sales surged 29%, according to company filings.
But the explosion ofdelivery appshas changed the game.
Now, pizza chains compete directly withevery restauranton the DoorDash or Uber Eats menu. Even casual-dining giants like Chili's and Olive Garden are in the mix.

""Clearly, American consumers are spending on delivery — but a much greater portion of that spending is going to categories other than pizza,"" Martin said.
""With the rise of delivery apps, chain pizza is no longer the only or easiest delivery option.""
George Holm, CEO of Performance Food Group, admitted at a conference last year that pizza is ""slow,"" according to Martin, who added that figures for independent pizzerias are harder to find.
Donatos, a Columbus, Ohio–based chain with locations nationwide, is seeing guests shift from first-party transactions to third-party apps.
""We believe we need to meet the guests where they are,"" Kevin King, CEO and president, told Fox News Digital. ""This new world gives us lots of new ways to reach guests, and we try to be present in all of them.""

Experts warn that convenience comes with a cost.
""Every time a customer orders through DoorDash or Uber Eats, that order and that customer now belong to the platform,"" Li-ran Navon, CEO of Sauce, a restaurant delivery and customer retention platform, told Fox News Digital.
""They use that data to promote other restaurants that pay higher commissions, so even a loyal customer can get pushed toward a competitor next time.""

PresidentDonald Trumpdefended his use of tariffs as critical to national security ahead of a landmark Supreme Court case, while warning the U.S. will not tolerate the mass killing of Christians in Nigeria and refusing to rule out potential military action in Venezuela.
Trump spoke with reporters on Air Force One as he flew from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Washington, D.C.
He was asked about the upcomingSupreme Court case on tariffs, which he called ""one of the most important decisions in the history of our country.""
Trump argued that the outcome will determine whether presidents can use tariffs freely as a tool for both economic leverage and national security.

That was going to be a disaster for the world, and I was able to settle it very quickly, very easily because I was able to use tariffs. It's total national security, and economic health is also part of national security, by the way.""
Trump said he will not attend oral arguments to avoid drawing attention to himself, explaining, ""It’s not about me. It’s about our country."" Instead, he plans to deliver a speech in Miami.
""I wanted to go so badly,"" he said. ""I just didn’t want to do anything to deflect from the importance of that decision.

""We've become wealthy,"" he said. ""Our stock market hit a record high on Friday – 48 record highs during my term – and a large part of that is because of tariffs and our good trade deals. Without that, you couldn’t make a good trade deal. We were being abused by a lot of other countries, including China, for years. Not anymore. Tariffs have brought us tremendous national security.""
Trump warned in a post on Truth Social that the upcoming Supreme Court case on tariffs could reshape America’s economic and national security future, arguing that presidents must have the power to impose tariffs freely to protect U.S. interests and negotiate strong trade deals.

He said tariffs have fueled record market growth and ""great wealth"" during his presidency and remain vital to keeping the country competitive with global powers.
""It will be, in my opinion, one of the most important and consequential decisions ever made by theUnited States Supreme Court,"" Trump said. ""If we win, we will be the richest, most secure country anywhere in the world, by far. If we lose, our country could be reduced to almost third world status.""

He ruled out sending long-rangeTomahawk missiles to Ukraine, saying ""not really"" when asked if he was considering it.
""There's no final straw,"" he added. ""Sometimes you have to let it fight it out – that fighting and then fighting it out. It's been a tough war for a lot of soldiers.""
Trump also said the U.S. will not tolerate the mass killing of Christians in Nigeria.

A day earlier, he warned the U.S. will halt aid if Abuja does not stop the killings and said he may order rapid action to wipe out Islamist terrorists after designating Nigeria a country of particular concern.
The persecution of Christians in Nigeria has reached crisis levels as Islamist militants burn down villages, massacre worshipers and displace thousands across the north and central regions.
When asked about potentialU.S. strikes in Venezuela, Trump declined to confirm or deny, saying, ""How can I answer a question like that?""
""Who would say that?"" Trump asked a reporter. ""Supposing there were – would I say that to you? Honestly. Yes, we have plans. We have very secret plans. Look, we'll see what happens with Venezuela.

A new trend has been gaining traction in theinvestment communityand is picking up steam across America. This strategy, Biblically Responsible Investing (BRI), may well be worth your attention, whether you’re a devout believer, a cautious steward of your money or just someone who has leaned more into your faith.
What is Biblically Responsible Investing?
Using BRI, investors seek to align their financial decisions with biblical principles. It’s not just aboutreturn on investment. It’s about honoring the Lord with how we invest the resources He has entrusted to us. Basically, you invest in companies that align with Christian values and avoid those whose business practices or social stances conflict with those values.
Over the past 30 plus years of my investment career, I’ve seen socially responsible investing, ethical investing, the huge push for ESG investing, and now we are starting to see the rise of Biblically Responsible Investing.

Is It Time For You To Start Biblically Investing?
If you’re someone who believes that ""Whatever you do, do all for the glory of God"" (1 Corinthians 10:31) applies to how you make money and not just how you spend it, then BRI may be a tool worth considering. If you view your investments solely as a profit machine with no moral reflection, then perhaps it’s time you turn the page.
Biblically Responsible Investing could be a fad and could be more permanent as anew forceful culturetakes place here in America. For Christian investors who want their money to reflect their faith, for stewards who believe God owns everything, and for families who think about the legacy of their wealth it offers a powerful option. One that connects the marketplace with the pew and the balance sheet with the Bible.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/its-scary-snap-recipients-brace-fallout-benefits-vanish-during-shutdown,‘It’s scary’: SNAP recipients brace for fallout as benefits vanish during shutdown,"As the government shutdown nears a month, millions of Americans who rely on SNAP are bracing for benefits to run out. In Illinois, food banks say they’re seeing lines grow longer each day.
SPRINGFIELD, IL –As the federal government shutdown drags into its second month, millions of low-income Americans – including thousands in Illinois – are now facing the cutoff ofSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)benefits, bracing for what lies ahead as food pantry lines grow longer by the day.
For residents like Lisa Weaving of Springfield, the loss of food aid is more than a political standoff – it's a looming crisis.
""It’s scary because I’m a cancer survivor. I’m in remission. My doctor has not released me to go back to work yet, so I’m on disability, and I really need the extra for food, because by the time I pay all the bills, there’s really nothing left,"" Weaving said.

She said her apartment building houses veterans, seniors and others on disability. ""The entire building right now is in an uproar because they don’t know wherethey’re going to get their foodfrom. We have the bread line across the street, but that’s only one meal a day.""
Weaving said many neighbors are turning to multiple pantries. ""We have a pantry that’s open on Wednesdays from 12:30 to 3, and it’s once a month. You can get about 10 items per person. If you have kids, more. So it’s really a help for many, but their food doesn’t last an entire month. So you’re hopping from pantry to pantry.""
USDA data show that more than 41 million Americans use SNAP, with participation rates highest in New Mexico, Oregon and Louisiana.(USDA/Fox News)
At Washington Street Mission in Springfield, director Jarid Brown said demand in Central Illinois has surged sharply since benefits were frozen. ""Yesterday I got a call from one of our churches who has a large food pantry, and they had twice the number of people there that night and actually cleaned everything out. If we double that number, it’s only going to last a few weeks. If we see triple that number come in, we’ll be cleaned out within a couple of weeks.""
FEDERAL WORKERS BRACE FOR MISSED PAYCHECK AS SHUTDOWN ENTERS 5TH WEEK
""If you’re living in poverty, if you are in that lowest income, it’s hard enough to climb out of poverty as it is. But now you add in rising food prices and you add in rising utility prices. It makes it nearly impossible for anyone to get out of that hole,"" Brown added.

""This is the first time it’s actually going to hit hard,"" Weaving said. ""And to think there are 42 million, they’re saying, that are going to be hungry in a place like Springfield. We do worry that the crime rate might go up because of this.""

""There are able bodies that may be abusing the system, but there are so many that need this,"" Weaving said.
Brown worries about the pause in benefits. ""The greatest impact that we’ve had with the budget shutdown is going to be the SNAP benefits being frozen off,"" he said. ""My hope is that for a minute we can set politics aside and think about what it’s going to take to reopen government and then address the issues that we’re separated on later. But holding individuals who need food assistance hostage for one or two issues,we’re holding service personnel hostagefor over one or two issues, that’s not acceptable.""

https://www.foxnews.com/us/strip-club-executives-allegedly-bribed-tax-auditor-lap-dances-luxury-trips-slash-tax-bills,Strip club executives allegedly bribed tax auditor with lap dances and luxury trips to slash tax bills,"Fox News Digital spoke with federal defense attorney Ronald Chapman II about the high-profile New York strip club bribery and tax fraud case, where executives are accused of plying a state tax auditor with cash, Florida trips and lap dances.
A group of strip club executives allegedly bribed a New York state tax auditor with cash, luxury Florida trips and lap dances worth thousands of dollars a day to slash millions from their tax bills, according to a sweeping indictment byAttorney General Letitia James.
The 79-count indictment accuses top leaders of RCI Hospitality Holdings Inc., the Texas-based parent company behind strip clubs Rick’s Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret and Hoops Cabaret, of using their venues to disguise bribes as ""promotional"" expenses and avoid more than $8 million in sales taxes between 2010 and 2024.
Prosecutors say the auditor received at least 13 all-expenses-paidtrips to Florida, where the company’s top leadership was allegedly given hotel rooms, restaurant meals and up to $5,000 per day for private dances at RCI-owned clubs.

DOJ SEEKS REMOVAL OF COMEY'S DEFENSE LAWYER, CITING CONFLICT OF INTEREST
Federal defense attorney Ronald Chapman II said the allegations, while ""sensational,"" may not prove criminal intent once tested in court.
""When you look a little deeper, things start to look a little bit different,"" Chapman told Fox News Digital. ""This case reminds me of the [President] Trump financial-fraud case, whereprosecutors in New York built a sweeping narrativearound business judgments that may not actually violate the law.""
Chapman saidprosecutors face an uphill battleto prove a quid pro quo and that the auditor’s decisions were directly influenced by the perks.
""It only turns into bribery when that is also done consistent with bad conduct, looking the other way on something,"" he said. ""I just don’t see that other side of the quid pro quo yet.""

He also questioned the timing of the charges, pointing to the embattled attorney general.
""We see, once again, a very late indictment being brought. That means somebody brought this case from a pile of cases and decided to pluck it out,"" he said.
""Oftentimes we will see prosecutors right around the time they're about to be facing re-election, trying to bring big cases like this with sensational headlines where they don't really have the goods to fully handle the prosecution,"" he said.

James is facing one count ofbank fraudand one count of making false statements to a financial institution. The allegations stem from a home she purchased in 2020 in Norfolk, Virginia.
Prosecutors say James misrepresented the property as a secondary residence on loan/mortgage documents, when in fact they allege she used it as a rental investment property, which qualified her for more favorable loan terms. She has pleaded not guilty.

The indictment, filed inNew York County Supreme Court, names RCI Chief Executive Officer Eric Langan, Controller Timothy Winata, Chief Financial Officer Bradley Chhay, Operations Director Ahmed ""Ed"" Anakar, and Nightclub Operations Director Shaun Kevlin as defendants. A sixth individual has also been charged but was not identified because of the sealed indictment.
RCI and its three Manhattan-based clubs, Rick’s Cabaret, Vivid Cabaret and Hoops Cabaret and Sports Bar, are also charged in the case, which includes counts of criminal tax fraud, bribery, conspiracy and filing false business records.
If convicted of the top counts, Langan, Winata and Anakar could each face up to 25 years in prison, while Chhay and Kevlin could face a maximum of 15 years.

James described the case as a blatant abuse of power by a publicly traded company seeking to skirt its tax obligations.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/broadcast-bias-4-big-stories-networks-buried-make-democrats-look-good,BROADCAST BIAS: 4 big stories networks buried to make Democrats look good,"Former President Barack Obama called for ""regulatory constraints"" on social media during a conversation in June and said the U.S. should experiment with new forms of journalism.
The dominant form ofmedia biasagainst Republicans is bias by commission, when reporters accuse them of committing all kinds of abuses and indignities. They are considered guilty of neglecting the vulnerable in their policies and corruption in their dealings.
Democrats benefit from the opposite: bias by omission. Back in 1992, CBS reporter Betsy Aaron warned: ""The largest opinion is what we leave out. I mean, it sounds simplistic, but I always say worry about what you're not seeing. What you are seeing you can really criticize, because you're smart and you have opinions. But if we don't tell you anything, and we leave whole areas uncovered, that's the danger.""
Watching the broadcast network ""news"" programs this week was often an exercise in noting what they left out. Here are just four examples.
1. The FBI reported that a 29-year-old Minnesota man, Tyler Maxon Avalos, now faces one federal charge for transmitting a TikTok post that read, in part: ""Wanted.Pam Bondi, preferably dead,"" and referred to a reward of $45,000. A threat about murdering the attorney general of the United States drew a story Monday on ""NBC Nightly News,"" but ABC, CBS and PBS couldn’t be bothered.

BROADCAST BIAS: ON UPSIDE-DOWN TV NETWORKS, ICE AND THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE THE DANGEROUS LAW-BREAKERS
This omission was especially galling on NPR, which often acted as an eager publicity arm for former PresidentJoe Biden’s Attorney General Merrick Garland. This week, Justice Department correspondent Ryan Lucas appeared all over the network to warn about the dangers of President Trump designating Antifa as a domestic terrorism group. NPR is much more concerned about the work of Antifa than the life of Pam Bondi.
2. The American Federation of Government Employees President Everett Kelley issued a statement to NBC News on Monday saying, ""It's time to pass aclean continuing resolutionand end the shutdown today, no half-measures and no gamesmanship."" That was aimed at Democrats, since Republicans have constantly pushed a clean resolution. NBC reported it online, but it didn’t make the nightly newscast. ABC and CBS skipped it that night. PBS gave it 18 seconds.
3. On Tuesday, Oct. 28, theRepublican-led House Oversight Committee released its reporton the Biden White House staff covering up Biden's mental decline. Chairman James Comer, R-Ky. summarized: ""The Biden Autopen Presidency will go down as one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. As Americans saw President Biden’s decline with their own eyes, Biden’s inner circle sought to deceive the public, cover-up his decline, and took unauthorized executive actions with the autopen that are now invalid.""
TRUMP HITS ABC, NBC AS ‘FAKE NEWS,’ SAYS HE’D SUPPORT FCC REVOKING LICENSES
ABC, CBS and NBC aired nothing. PBS offered a dismissive brief. NPR's ""All Things Considered"" performed an interview, but all it ""considered"" was whether Biden's autopen pardons could be reversed. All the committee's findings, videos and transcripts of powerful Biden White House officials were not explained.
4. On Wednesday, Oct. 29, Iowa Republican Sen.Chuck Grassleyreleased documents detailing ""Arctic Frost,"" an operation where Biden-appointed special counsel Jack Smith went absolutely overboard in issuing subpoenas to investigate Biden’s political opponents, in the guise of a January 6 probe. Smith fired off nearly 200 subpoenas against 430 Republican figures and groups. This came after the Biden Justice Department prosecuted over 1,000 of Biden’s opponents who were held responsible in the January 6 riots.

But the broadcast networks who lovingly chronicled whatever Team Biden wanted to underline about Smith’s probes suddenly couldn’t find anything. ABC, CBS and NBC have aerobically ignored it while they obsessed over Hurricane Melissa and the government shutdown. They had time for stories on a dog falling down a cliff and a monkey getting loose in a toy store, but not Democrats behaving badly.
When Republican committees conduct investigations, it’s simply not newsworthy. When then-House SpeakerNancy Pelosiconcocted a totally one-sided January 6 committee, every minute of every hearing was aired live.

Ken Starr was demonized by the media as a demented Puritan for overreach investigating PresidentBill Clintonin the 1990s. Smith was uniformly presented as a hero. CNN even documented him making a run to Subway for lunch, because, aw shucks, he’s like the common man. So, it’s not surprising that when Republicans present evidence of a different narrative, the liberal networks buried it like it was a rotting corpse.
The silliest lie circulating in politics today is that PresidentDonald Trumphas weaponized the Department of Justice in an unprecedented way to go after his political opponents. Every educated American who repeats this is a liar. It’s outrageous that every elitist TV network in this country tries to defend this lie by suppressing the story about how dramatically weaponized Biden’s DOJ was.

President Donald Trump said Friday his administration has askedfederal courtsto clarify whether it can legally release Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) payments as the government shutdown continues.
In a statementposted to Truth Social, Trump said government lawyers had raised doubts about whether existing funds could be used for the November distribution and that two courts have issued conflicting opinions on the matter.
""Our Government lawyers do not think we have the legal authority to pay SNAP with certain monies we have available, and now two Courts have issued conflicting opinions on what we can and cannot do,"" Trump wrote. ""I do NOT want Americans to go hungry just because the Radical Democrats refuse to do the right thing and REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT.""
The president said he had instructed administration attorneys to ask the courts for clarification ""as soon as possible.""

""If we are given the appropriate legal direction by the Court, it will BE MY HONOR to provide the funding, just like I did with Military and Law Enforcement Pay,"" Trump added. ""TheDemocrats should quit this charadewhere they hurt people for their own political reasons, and immediately REOPEN THE GOVERNMENT.""
Trump urged food stamp recipients to contact Senate Democrats, writing, ""If you useSNAP benefits, call the Senate Democrats, and tell them to reopen the Government, NOW! Here is Cryin’ Chuck Schumer’s Office Number.""
SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, provides aid to about 42 million Americans each month, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Funding for the program depends on congressional appropriations, which have lapsed during thecurrent shutdown.

The president made his comments one day before the scheduled Nov. 1 payment date for many recipients. The USDA has not publicly confirmed whether benefits will be issued if the courts do not provide new guidance.
Trump has repeatedly accused Democrats of prolonging the shutdown to gain political leverage, while Democrats say the White House could reopen the government by signing a short-term spending bill already passed in the Senate.

White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett lent his support to President Donald Trump, calling for Republicans to end the filibuster to bring the government shutdown to an end in an interview Friday on ""The Story.""
""Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!"" the presidentwrote on Truth Social, saying Republicans should use what he referred to as the ""nuclear option.""
The ""nuclear option"" would remove a 60-vote threshold, leading Republicans to only require a simple majority to pass their federal funding bill.
JOHNSON RAISES SHUTDOWN STAKES ON SCHUMER AS FOOD STAMP DEADLINE, OBAMACARE CLIFF LOOM
Hassett agreed that the filibuster should be ""on the table"" because the Democrats might ""try to keep the government shut down forever as far as we know.""
Both House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have expressed hesitation about getting rid of thefilibuster and its 60-vote threshold.
Hassett also theorized that Democratic politicians are trying to ""stop the president’s momentum"" after a""historic"" trip to Asia, lauding a soybean deal reached with China’s President Xi Jinping.
""We’re not going to let them keep the government shut forever,"" Hassett said. ""We’re not going to let them starve the American people.""
Hassett stressed the importance of bringing the shutdown to an end before theSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which delivers relief to around 42 million Americans who rely on the aid, will see benefits expire Nov. 1. An expiration of SNAP would be the first time in 60 years the program has halted due to a government shutdown.
""We’re about to use emergency funds from the Department of Agriculture,"" Hassett said, referring to ways to fund the program.
This comes after court orders to tap intoemergency funds from two federal judgesin Massachusetts and Rhode Island ahead of the Nov. 1 expiration of benefits.
Hassett criticized what he called a ""liberal judge ruling,"" saying that tapping emergency funds would make the government vulnerable in a future hurricane or food emergency.
Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., criticized Trumpfor ""using hunger as a political weapon,"" referring to SNAP.
""What really surprises me is the level of cruelty that is marking Republican leadership right now,"" Booker said.
Hassett reacted by saying Democrats need to do their ""constitutional duty"" and reopen the government.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-prepares-confront-monumental-case-trump-executive-power-tariff-authority,Supreme Court prepares to confront monumental case over Trump executive power and tariff authority,"President Trump says he’s cutting tariffs on Chinese imports by 10% after meeting with Xi Jinping in Busan, citing progress on trade, fentanyl, and rare-earth exports.
Economic imperative or executive overreach? That is the question the Supreme Court is preparing this week to confront, in one of its most monumental appeals over the scope of executive power, a time-sensitive challenge to PresidentDonald Trump's expansive import tariffs over most countries.
The justices will hear oral arguments Wednesday over lawsuits from a coalition of small businesses and severalDemocratic-led states, who say Trump has abused his authority by declaring a ""national emergency"" to impose levies on nearly every country in the world.
At issue is whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) gives the president that power.
TRUMP CUTS CHINA TARIFF AFTER XI SIGNALS TOUGHER FENTANYL ENFORCEMENT, RARE-EARTH PAUSE
Lower federal courts have ruled against the Executive Branch, butTrump's Justice Departmentwarns ""denial of tariff authority would expose our nation to trade retaliation without effective defenses.""
The financial and political stakes are enormous, with potential immediate effects on the domestic and global economies. Businesses and industries, large and small, are nervously watching how the Court will act.
""The Supreme Court will decide whether or not Congress, in fact, gave the president the fairly broad authority that he's claimed to impose [tariffs] on, in a way that no president has used it before,"" said Thomas Dupree, a leading appellate attorney and a former top Justice Department official. ""Not to say that's necessarily impermissible, but it is something that the Supreme Court has not seen in recent years and is going to weigh in on whether or not he's overstepped the authority that he has under the law.""
The consolidated, expedited appeals will be the first major test on the merits of the White House's aggressive second-term agenda to remake large swaths of the federal government, and the outsized role this president has so far played.
The administration has been winning most of the emergency appeals at the Supreme Court since January dealt only with whether challenged policies could go into effect temporarily, while the issues play out in the lower courts — including immigration, federal spending cuts, workforce reductions and transgenders in the military.

In doing so, the 6-3 conservative majority has reversed about two dozen preliminary nationwide injunctions imposed by lower federal courts, leading to frustration and confusion among many judges.
Now those percolating petitions are starting to reach the Supreme Court for final review — and legal analysts say the bench may be poised to grant broad unilateral powers to the president.
The justices fast-tracked the administration's appeal over sweeping tariffs on nearly every country, which were blocked by lower courts.
A high court ruling on the merits could come quickly, perhaps within weeks. Both sides have urged a quick decision, since the U.S. has been engaged in active,ongoing trade negotiationswith dozens of countries over the past months.
This could be the start of several high-profile merits appeals over Trump's executive actions.
In December, the justices will decide whether to overturn a 90-year precedent dealing with the president's ability to fire members of some federal regulatory agencies like the Federal Trade Commission.
SENATE REPUBLICANS DEFECT, REJECT TRUMP'S TARIFFS ON CANADIAN GOODS
And in January, the power of President Trump to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors will be tested in another major constitutional showdown. For now, the Biden-appointed Cook will remain on the job.
Other appeals that could be added to the high court argument docket include birthright citizenship and otherimmigration-related petitions, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion policies in educational institutions and the environment.
Congress is given the power under the Constitution's Article I to ""lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.""
But when Trump in February began issuing a series of executive orders, he relied on the IEEPA, which gives the president the power — under a self-declared national economic emergency — to ""investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.""
TheTrump Justice Departmentsays the choices are stark.
""President Trump and his advisors have determined that erroneously invalidating the IEEPA tariffs, 'would have catastrophic consequences for our national security, foreign policy, and economy,'"" wrote U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer, who will argue the case before the justices. Citing Trump's own words, ""The President has emphasized: 'If the United States were forced to unwind these historic agreements ... the economic consequences would be ruinous, instead of unprecedented success.""

But the plaintiffs claim no president until now in the law's five decades has ever used it to impose ""sweeping worldwide"" tariffs.
""Context, history and common sense all support a more modest understanding of that provision — one that leaves the President ample tools to address emergencies but does not delegate Congress' tariffing power wholesale,"" wrote Benjamin Gutman, Oregon's solicitor general, who will argue the case for the state plaintiffs. ""This Court should reject the President’s bid to seize that power for himself.""
Two categories of tariffs involving a variety of products are being contested: The first are ""trafficking tariffs,"" on goods fromCanada, China and Mexico, imposed after the Trump administration said those nations have not done enough to reduce the flow of fentanyl.
The second, broader category, labeled ""reciprocal tariffs,"" involves tariffs ranging from 10% to 50% on products from virtually all countries.
The Supreme Court will hold at least 80-minutes of scheduled oral arguments in its marble-lined courtroom, but the public session is expected to last much longer.
The justices will almost certainly have many questions of counsel from both sides, since they will be confronting a range of novel legal and constitutional questions over Trump's tariff authority.
TRUMP ASKS SUPREME COURT FOR URGENT RULING ON TARIFF POWERS AS 'STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER'
The arguments — audio of which will be streamed live on the court's website — will consist of the bench posing questions, comments and hypotheticals to lawyers from thefederal government, private business and the states.
After the public sessions, the justices will meet privately — perhaps later Wednesday — and vote on the case, at least preliminarily.
The majority and any dissenting opinions will be assigned, and the court go begin articulating a ruling that will serve as precedent for this and future disputes over executive authority.
The court will have no shortage of information to ponder. In addition to the written briefs filed by the opposing parties, about four dozen ""amicus"" briefs have been filed, offering a range of legal positions from advocacy groups, other state governments and legal and economic scholars.

The unpredictable, ongoing rollout of tariffs has createdglobal economic uncertaintyand fears of higher consumer prices, but Trump has also used them as political leverage to pressure countries into negotiating new trade deals.
""A big fraction of the Supreme Court's docket will present the question, can President Trump do: fill in the blank? And that includes imposed tariffs,"" said Dupree. ""Trump is pushing at every limit and the Supreme Court this term is going to be telling us whether he's exceeded those limits. That is going to be the story of so much of what the Supreme Court is deciding this term is whether the president has [acted] within or has exceeded.""

SCHUMER'S SHUTDOWN IS LEAVING OUR TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES HIGH AND DRY
For decades,teachers unionsand the liberal allies they bankroll in D.C. have told the American people that without the federal bureaucracy, education would crumble. They said states couldn’t handle education funding, accountability or innovation without ""guidance.""
They were wrong.
Schools continued operating during the shutdown because the real funding — Title I, IDEA, and other major streams, flows through long-established formulas and scheduled appropriations that continue even when federal staff are not at their desks. States already administer these dollars.
The shutdown simply paused administrative processing and new rulemaking, not the actual flow of funds to schools. In other words, theDepartment of Educationwasn’t ""running the system"" before this, and the shutdown proved it.
TRUMP IS USING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO DO SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE
The shutdown proved what many of us already knew: states are not only capable of managing education, they already do. Education in this country is funded and governed primarily at the state and local level. The federal government adds bureaucracy, not value.
Let’s be clear: there was never any reason for the U.S. Department of Education to exist. It was created as a political favor in 1979, a deal between Jimmy Carter and the teachers unions to lock in their power. And it shows.
Theteachers unionsare not just one of many players in this story. They are the reason the Department of Education exists at all. The department gives them power, money and political protection, and in return, the unions defend the department’s existence at every turn. One feeds the other. That is why they work so hard to convince Americans the country would collapse without them, because without Washington, they lose control.

The teachers unions have been feeding off the Department of Education for decades to weaponize money and influence, pumping ideology into curriculum standards, teacher training programs and accreditation pipelines that tell parents to sit down and shut up.
Now that the department’s lights are off, they’re panicking. You’ll see their headlines: ""The world is burning down without the Department of Education!"" The only thing ""burning"" are the lies they have peddled to Americans for 40 years.
Out here in the real world,kids are learning, teachers are teaching, and parents are back in control. The system works just fine without federal interference.

This shutdown is a wake-up call. It didn’t break American education. It exposed who has been breaking it all along.
The unions can go cry about it. The rest of us will keep doing our jobs.

Natalie Folino is making ends meet for her family.
The stay-at-home mom of three from Dayton, Ohio, is harnessing the power of social media and side hustles to get her family through thefederal government shutdown.
""Currently, my husband is an essential employee for the Department of Defense, which means that he is still going to work every day,"" Folino told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""He's commuting 40 minutes every way, but we are just not receiving a paycheck, which is a little problematic for a family like mine, who is a single-income family.""
Folino was already growingher social media brandbefore the shutdown, but now her side hustles are taking on a whole new significance. Due to the shutdown, her family has been without her husband's income for 29 days and counting.
HERE'S WHAT TRUMP WANTS TO DO TO RESHAPE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DURING THE SHUTDOWN

To help keep her family afloat this month, Folino has taken on numerous side hustles and is documenting them on social media platformssuch as Instagramand TikTok, where she has amassed nearly 200,000 followers combined and more than 2 million likes on TikTok alone.
Her goal for October is to earn $5,000 — an ambitious target.(Spoiler alert: she did it!)
""I have to earn $160 every single day. No days off, we have just a couple of days to go,"" Folino told Fox News Digital.
SCHUMER'S SHUTDOWN IS LEAVING OUR TROOPS AND THEIR FAMILIES HIGH AND DRY
Folino isn’t new toearning extra cashon the side. She began documenting her side hustles about two and a half years ago to help pay for her children’s increasingly expensive soccer activities. Over time, her experience juggling odd jobs has primed her with skills for financial emergencies like the one her family is facing this month.
""Overall, we are dipping into our savings,"" Folino said. ""I know that we are in a more blessed position than lots of people, so nothing for our family has actually changed other than the fact we're kind of moving my earnings around a little bit.""
Folino has showcased a variety ofside hustles, including laundry services, dog walking, social media monetization, coaching calls and even affiliate shopping links. In her videos, she notes charging $70 for two bags of laundry and $25 for dog walking.
SHUTDOWN FIGHT CASTS A SHADOW OVER JOBS AS TRUMP PREPARES FOR LARGEST FEDERAL RESIGNATION IN US HISTORY
In her videos, Folino said her earnings have ranged from as high as $431 on some days to as little as $22 on others. She noted that she could have earned even more this month, but because she lives in a large Air Force community, some of her clients have also been affected bygovernment furloughs and layoffs, further exacerbating the strain on the local economy.
While families with government employees can’t control the federal shutdown, Folino said people can control how they respond to challenges.
""There may be circumstances that are entirely out of your control. But there are a couple of things that I think that you can control,"" she said.

""I think that you could control your attitude and your outlook and I really think that you can control your work ethic. I am definitely a pull yourself up by your bootstraps-type mentality and I think that if you set a goal, and you're willing to justreally workand put yourself out there, there's really no limit to it.""
In a video posted on Thursday, Folino shared an update with her followers on her efforts to earn $5,000 in the month of October, saying not only did she hit her goal, but she surpassed it by $224.
A visibly emotional Folino thanked her followers for their support and revealed that she will donate her earnings from the last two days of October to those in need in her community.
""Anything is possible,"" she said.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/when-we-call-everything-ism-we-stop-hearing-what-voters-actually-care-about,"When we call everything an 'ism,' we stop hearing what voters actually care about","Fox News host Will Cain gives his take on the support behind New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani on 'The Will Cain Show.'
Every few election cycles,America rediscoversan old political pastime: name-calling dressed up as moral clarity. This year’s favorite epithet is ""socialist.""
Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and New York City mayoral hopefulZohran Mamdanihave each been branded with it, often before they finish a sentence.  To their critics, the word evokes Venezuela or the Soviet Union. To their supporters, it means fairness, dignity or simply a system that finally works for ordinary people.
But when we label something an -ism, we often fail to see what’s actually resonating. Because underneath the slogans and self-descriptions, the other side is winning on the issues that matter most to people’s daily lives: the economy, fairness, opportunity, affordability.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pose for a photo in Astoria, Queens, Sept. 6, 2025. (@ZohranKMamdani via X)
The echo chamber of righteousness
It’s tempting to believe thatcalling someone a ""socialist""— or a ""fascist,"" or a ""communist"" — delivers moral precision. It doesn’t. It delivers applause.
HOW THE LEFT'S EMBRACE OF MAMDANI COULD DOOM DEMOCRATS NATIONWIDE
In 1964, Democrats called Barry Goldwater a fascist. He lost, but mostly because he frightened moderates with talk of nuclear war — not because the label landed. What did land was the ""Daisy"" ad, a 60-second spot that aired once and changed politics forever.
A little girl plucks petals from a flower as her voice fades into a missile countdown. Then comes a nuclear explosion and Lyndon Johnson’s voice: ""These are the stakes: to make a world in which all of God’s children can live, or to go into the dark."" That ad didn’t call Goldwater names; it made voters feel the stakes. It worked because it tied fear to a credible consequence, not an ideology.
Ever since,politicians have tried to recreatethat emotional impact — often forgetting that fear persuades only when it feels believable. Decades later, Republicans warned Barack Obama was a socialist. He won twice. In 2016 and 2024, Democrats branded Donald Trump a fascist. He still won. The pattern is clear: moral name-calling doesn’t persuade. It polarizes. It makes us feel righteous but sound out of touch.
The illusion of moral clarity
When everything becomes an -ism, we stop listening for the ""why."" AOC talks about workingfamilies crushed by rent and debt. Bernie talks about dignity in work. Mamdani talks about a city that feels rigged against the middle.
5 THINGS NEW YORK REPUBLICANS NEED TO HEAR FROM ANDREW CUOMO
You don’t have to agree with their solutions to understand why that message lands. Labeling them ""socialist"" doesn’t answer their critique — it avoids it. And while we argue over ideology, voters are hearing something simpler and more emotional: someone sees me. That’s why these movements gain traction — not because people are clamoring for socialism, but because they’re desperate for fairness.
The right response isn’t a label — it’s a vision
Instead of calling Mamdani a communist, the right might try saying: We agree — New York should still be the city where anything can happen, where dreams come true and anyone can get ahead. But the answer isn’t handouts or punishing success. It’s creating more opportunity for everyone.That’s the message that connects. It’s aspirational, not accusatory.
Imagine if conservatives said: Here are three things we’d do instead.
That’s not socialism. It’s shared success. And it reframes the conversation from fear to possibility.

When words lose meaning, trust follows
We throw ideological grenades — ""socialist,"" ""fascist,"" ""extremist,"" ""woke"" — the way we once tossed adjectives. The result is exhaustion. When everything’s a five-alarm fire, voters stop evacuating the building. The danger isn’t just polarization; it’s meaning collapse. When language becomes theater, politics becomes parody. Outrage turns into a drug. Empathy becomes a weakness.
The working class isn’t asking for -isms
Spend time in diners, union halls and church basements, and you won’t hear ideological language. You’ll heareconomic anxiety. Parents wondering if their kids can afford to live where they grew up. Workers asking why two jobs still don’t cover rent. They’re not asking for capitalism or socialism. They’re asking for fairness — a shot at stability and dignity. When politicians argue about -isms instead of ideas, they sound detached from real life.
The politics of normalcy
The leaders who have endured — Reagan, Clinton, Obama in his best moments — didn’t win by labeling their opponents. They won by reassuring voters that their own vision was steady, sane and hopeful.

Reagan didn’t demonize liberalism; he reframed it. He made it about consequences —higher taxes, slower growth, less freedom. That’s what effective communicators do: they translate ideology into impact. That’s what the right could do now — not rail against socialism, but reassert the American idea that fairness comes from opportunity, not resentment.
The bottom line
If everything you oppose becomes an -ism, you’ll eventually run out of language — and then out of listeners. The goal isn’t to out-label your opponent. It’s to out-listen them. Because the side that will win the next decade isn’t the one shouting the loudest. It’s the one that makes Americans believe again that this country — their country — is still a place where hard work pays off, where fairness feels possible and where the dream still belongs to everyone.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/former-biden-bush-press-officials-join-forces-back-democrat-key-governors-race,Former Biden and Bush press officials join forces to back Democrat in key governor’s race,"Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor in New Jersey, tells Fox News Digital ""we have the biggest volunteer field program that anyone in New Jersey has ever run.""
FIRST ON FOX:A former Biden administration spokesman and a veteran GOP communicator who both advise affordability-focused policy group the Cost Coalition are backing New Jersey Democrat Mikie Sherrill’s run forgovernor, Fox News Digital has learned.
""After analyzing the plans of both candidates in the New Jersey governor's race, the difference between Mikie Sherrill and Jack Ciattarelli on this defining issue of affordability is enormous,"" Cost Coalition advisors Andrew Bates and Terry Holt wrote in their joint endorsement first obtained by Fox News Digital Wednesday. ""Mikie Sherrill has bold ideas to use the specific powers of the governorship to make a difference that families will feel.""
Bates served as the senior deputy press secretary of the White House under the Biden administration, and was a strong supporter of the former president amid his mounting health concerns during the 2024 election. Holt is a longtime Republican communicator and strategist who previously served as former Republican House Speaker John Boehner's senior advisor. He also worked as the national spokesman for the 2004 Bush–Cheney campaign before launching his own communications firm, Holt Communication Strategies.
The Cost Coalition is a bipartisan group of PresidentDonald Trumpcritics focused on lowering costs for U.S. residents and slashing the national debt by supporting leaders who ""invest in solutions that strengthen the economic security of American families,"" according to the group.

The Cost Coalition launched in April 2025, with Holt and Bates slamming Trump's economic policies in comment to The Associated Press at the time, claiming the president's ""agenda is an economic crisis threatening your livelihood and standard of living.""
The Cost Coalition includes a handful of allies from former Vice PresidentKamala Harris' 2024 campaign for the Oval Office, including Republican strategist Austin Weatherford, who headed up ""Republicans for Harris,"" Harris’ former national faith and engagement director Rev. Jennifer Butler, and the Harris campaign’s national director of veteran and military family engagement, The Associated Press reported in May.

The Cost Coalition's endorsement of Sherrill Wednesday argued that policies coming out of Washington, D.C., are ""worsening the cost crisis in America, forcingNew Jerseyfamilies to pay higher and higher prices for everything from utilities to groceries to health care.""
""Whether you’re a Republican or a Democrat, it’s undeniable that New Jerseyans need economic relief from inflationary tariffs, cuts to American energy and health care made to lower taxes for the rich, and trillions in new debt,"" the pair wrote. ""To take on the growing affordability crisis, the bipartisan Cost Coalition was founded to support leadership that puts pocketbook issues of working families front and center.""

Affordability is a top issue for both Sherrill and her Republican opponent for the governorship, Jack Ciattarelli, in a state notorious for sky-high taxes and chronic housing woes. Sherrill has campaigned on ordering a state of emergency over its electricity prices in order to freeze rates, supporting consolidating school districts to drive down property taxes, and lowering food costs by encouraging additional grocery store locations in the state to promote competition,the New Jersey Monitor reported.
SHERRILL PULLS OUT ALL STOPS WITH OBAMA ENDORSEMENT, STAR-STUDDED NEW JERSEY CAMPAIGN PUSH AS RACE TIGHTENS
""Sherrill will reduce grocery costs by rooting out price gouging and ensuring small businesses can compete with big chains,"" Holt and Bates continued in their endorsement. ""And she will cut red tape that is keeping home prices high, stop pharmacy middle-men from making drug prices even higher than they already are, and help create and keep good-paying New Jersey jobs.""
""Sherrill has been straight with voters about her opposition to the inflationary Washington policies that are supercharging costs, including tariffs — a historic tax hike on working people — cuts to health care and clean energy, and adding trillions in new, unsustainable debt to give tax breaks to those who need them least,"" they added.

Ciattarelli, who is backed by Trump, also has focused his campaign on affordability, pinning blame on Democrats for skyrocketing electricity costs in the state, vowing to ban wind farms and instead further diversify the state's energy resources with natural gas and nuclear power. Ciattarelli also has supported capping property taxes, restructuring income tax rates and rolling out incentives for small businesses, such as shielding small business owners from paying taxes on their first $100,000 in income.
""Energy — electricity in specific — is one of the reasons why we have an affordability crisis,"" the Republican candidate said during an October appearance on ""Fox & Friends."" ""The current administration has failed us. My opponent has doubled down. There’ll be no wind farms off our Jersey Shore, we’ll pull out of RGGI — which is a carbon tax policy that’s failed our state — and we’ll lower electricity bills on day one.""
Ciattarelli campaign strategist Chris Russell brushed off the endorsement and claims Sherrill would lower costs for residents.
""Anyone who believes Mikie Sherrill will lower costs needs their head examined. I suggest they get into see a therapist pronto to deal with that severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome they’re suffering from,"" he said.
Holt and Bates said they watched the New Jersey gubernatorial debates and gave Ciattarelli the ""benefit of the doubt"" before endorsing Sherrill.
BLUE STATE GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEES TRADE BARBS OVER CRUCIAL ISSUE WEEKS AHEAD OF ELECTION DAY
""Unfortunately, Jack Ciattarelli and his Washington backers support the Washington agenda that is driving costs and inflation up,"" they wrote. ""To give Ciattarelli the benefit of the doubt, we watched the debate closely in case he produced any last-minute plans to put New Jersey’s economy first. But he gave Washington’s cost-raising record an ‘A plus.’ So the bipartisan Cost Coalition gives him an ‘F.'""

In addition to new tariffs and broader grocery inflation, experts say a global cocoa shortage tied to poor harvests and climate shifts in West Africa has sent cocoa prices soaring.
Candy makers are responding by shrinking bars and experimenting with new products, including fruit-flavored, sour, chili-coated, goo-filled and freeze-dried sweets, as well as more cocoa-free white chocolate and crème options — and candy corn, of course.

Gatestone Institute senior fellow Gordon Chang also joins 'Fox News Live' to discuss his take on the trip and the broader threat China poses.
The U.S.-China trade war is shifting from a tariff fight to a contest of leverage – and Beijing is quietly setting the tempo.
As PresidentDonald Trumpraises the volume, Beijing is adjusting the dials, fine-tuning export controls, critical minerals and supply chains.
The move leaves Washington reacting to Beijing’s playbook instead of writing the next move, a dynamic that will hang over Trump’s next encounter with Chinese PresidentXi Jinping.
On Thursday, the two leaders of the world'slargest economiesare set to meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in Busan, South Korea. It will be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump’s return to office.

For Trump, thevisitis more than diplomatic choreography, it’s a stage for his economic doctrine. He’s anchored his Washington comeback on the idea of U.S. economic firepower, framing his battle cry around restoring American dominance in global trade and emerging technologies. In doing so, his administration has pressed allies and rivals alike to revisit trade terms, wielding tariffs as both weapon and warning.
""There are a lot of arrows in the Chinese quiver,"" Bryan Burack, a senior policy advisor for China and the Indo-Pacific at the Heritage Foundation, told Fox News Digital. ""The fact of the matter is that they can literally make more moves than we can. They have more coercive tools to use against us, and they can deploy them easier,"" Burack added, pointing to U.S. industrial dependencies.
""China has been decoupling from us for a long time,"" Burack said. ""So a lot of these moves that look like retaliation are really part of Xi Jinping's long-standing effort to sever dependence on the United States and build self-reliance on critical technologies. Unfortunately, the only way for us to respond is to do the same and that process is painful and excruciating,"" he added.
Clark Packard, a research fellow at the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, said the perception that China now holds the upper hand is misplaced.

""It is the most important bilateral relationship. It’s the most important geopolitical relationship,"" Packard said. ""But policymakers in the United States are overestimating China’s economic strength. Beijing believes global power is tilting its way, but that kind of defeatism in Washington is overdone. China’s economy isn’t nearly as strong as many people think.""
He pointed to deep imbalances withinChina’seconomy as evidence. ""It’s focused far too heavily on manufacturing and not enough on domestic consumption,"" he said. ""The country is increasingly dependent on exports and much of the world is growing uneasy with China’s outsized share of global trade,"" Packard added.
Henrietta Levin, a senior fellow on China studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit, said Trump and Xi will likely try to cool tensions on Thursday, at least for now.
""Both sides are seeking a period of stability in the relationship,"" said Levin, a former deputy China coordinator at the State Department. ""They may reach a limited arrangement, but on whose terms remain to be seen. China is confident it has the upper hand in the trade war and the broader relationship, so Beijing will be reluctant to make meaningful concessions without getting much more in return.""

Levin said that confidence stems from Beijing’s belief that the U.S. can’t absorb economic pain as deeply or as patiently as China can, betting that any trade war will hurt Washington faster and harder.
""What would really strengthen the U.S. hand is deepening partnerships, especially in Asia. Creating a common front against Chinese aggression and unfair trade practices, rather than trying to confront China and its allies at the same time.""
Levin added that Washington must also regain control of the diplomatic narrative. ""The U.S. would be better off setting the terms of the relationship rather than merely reacting,"" she said. ""It feels like we may have lost the plot in our diplomacy with China and have lost sight of the structural economic issues the trade war was originally meant to address.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/new-study-just-exposed-corruption-behind-americas-homelessness-crisis,A new study just exposed the corruption behind America's homelessness crisis,"HUD Secretary Scott Turner discusses President Donald Trump's plan to combat sky-high home prices on 'Fox & Friends.'
For years, Americans have been told that""compassion"" for the homelessmeant writing ever-larger checks – more money, more programs and far less accountability.
Now, at last, we have some answers for whyhomelessness has explodedeven amid a tripling of public spending.
Agroundbreaking investigation, ""Infiltrated""– backed by more than 50 pages of documentation from the Capital Research Center in cooperation with Discovery Institute – pulls back the curtain on a vast system of corruption. It reveals how billions in taxpayer funds intended to lift people out of homelessness have instead bankrolled radical activism and anti-American political agendas,betraying both the taxpayers who fund it and the homeless they were meant to help.
We finally have some answers for why homelessness has exploded even amid a tripling of public spending.(Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images)
Despite unprecedented resources, homelessness in the United States now stands at its highest level in U.S. history. ""Infiltrated"" details how the nation’s most prominent ""homeless advocacy"" organizations have been weaponized against the very people they claim to serve – redirecting compassion into ideology and dependency into power.
BLAME DRUGS AND MENTAL ILLNESS, NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR THE CHAOS GRIPPING OUR STREETS
It exposes how radical networks have quietly embedded themselves within leading homelessness nonprofits, sharing infrastructure, donors and ideology.
What began as a movement rooted in compassion has metastasized into what can only be described as a Homelessness Industrial Complex – a sprawling web of nonprofits, bureaucrats and activists feeding off the very crisis they claim to solve.
They’ve built an empire of corruption draped in ""evidence-based"" slogans that shield politics, protect paychecks and betray the vulnerable.
The report lays it bare: these networks posture as defenders of America’s homeless, yet in truth, they have become their greatest exploiters,dependent on failure to sustain power.
The origins trace back to 2013, when the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)enshrined Housing First as federal doctrine. Promising to ""end homelessness in a decade,"" HUD stripped away requirements for treatment and accountability, effectively institutionalizing a policy.
The result? Spending soared. Grants proliferated. Outcomes collapsed.
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH HUMAN SUFFERING IN HOMELESS ENCAMPMENTS TO KNOW TRUMP'S NEW POLICY IS RIGHT
The Supreme Court’s Grants Pass v. Johnson case further exposed the rot. Over 700 nonprofits – collectively taking in $2.9 billion in government grants – filed briefs defending public encampments and opposing enforcement of anti-camping laws as ""cruel and unusual punishment."" Their concern wasn’t compassion – it was the preservation of their money pot.
Private foundations joined the crusade.
Major philanthropic giants – Ford, Robert Wood Johnson and Gates Foundations – poured billions into Housing First and ""equity"" initiatives to promote ideology under the guise of helping the homeless.
Donor-advised funds masked the flow of money, enabling anonymous advocacy giving that blurred the line between charity and politics.
Meanwhile, coalitions like Funders Together to End Homelessness funneled vast sums toward upstream political causes – including the promotion of reparations and anti-policing movements…all under the moral camouflage of addressing homelessness.
THESE CITIES' FEIGNED COMPASSION MAKING DRUG AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES WORSE
Donors and taxpayersthought they were funding solutions. Instead, their money fueled lawsuits, lobbying and ideological activism that deepened despair.
A prior Capital Research Center report, ""Marching Toward Violence,"" exposed deep overlap between homelessness coalitions and extremist networks – pro-Hamas organizations, Marxist movements and anarchist collectives sharing the same funders and infrastructure. Groups like the Western Regional Advocacy Project glorify violent fugitives such as Assata Shakur, while the Autonomous Tenants Union Network boasts about rejecting cooperation with mainstream nonprofits to preserve ""revolutionary independence.""
They have hijacked the language of compassion to wage a political war against law enforcement, property rights and personal responsibility.
The outcome is measurable and devastating: billions spent, streets worse than ever, and a 77% increase in the death rate among the homeless, under the banner of ""justice.""
For too long, the Homelessness Industrial Complex has thrived in darkness, remaining untouchable, unaccountable and unchallenged. But sunlight is finally piercing through.

President Donald Trump’s recentexecutive order on homelessnessmarks the first serious course correction in over a decade. The complex’s all-out resistance – including a recently-filed lawsuit – only underscores its entrenchment and fear of being held accountable for real outcomes.
But the homeless can no longer wait.
If compassion is to mean anything, funding must be tied to measurable outcomes such as real reductions in homelessness. Every dollar should be used to restore human lives, notbankroll ideological causes.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-what-donald-trump-joe-biden-have-common-energy-policy,Here's what Donald Trump and Joe Biden have in common on energy policy,"Energy Secretary Chris Wright joins ‘America’s Newsroom’ to discuss energy policy, crude oil prices and the ongoing government shutdown.
The late, great philosopher and New York Yankees baseball catcher, Yogi Berra, once declared, ""It's déjà vu all over again."" While Berra was referring to something relating to America’s favorite pastime, the same could be said about recent decisions by the Trump administration tocancel offshore wind projectsup and down the East Coast, especially in comparison to the Biden administration’s cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline.
At first blush, these decisions might seem like exact opposites — one focused on renewable energy, the other at fossil fuels. But in reality, they are both political decisions that hurt confidence in theenergy industry, jeopardize jobs and ultimately affect our nation’s domestic energy security. Predictability matters most when it comes to companies and workers in the energy field, whether you’re laying gas pipelines, exploring for oil or constructing wind farms.
And I’m not alone in expressing these concerns. In recent weeks, Colette Hirstius, president of Shell USA, publicly questioned the Trump administration’s decision to halt fully permitted wind projects, asserting it is ""very damaging"" to investment and calling for more consistency in regulation.

She reminded observers that ""energy projects with proper permits should be allowed to proceed,"" regardless of political decision-making. Companies like Shell are not simply defending wind farms. Hirstius went further and warned that the same playbook could be used against oil and gas projects.
THIS IS HOW AMERICA WILL ACHIEVE ENERGY DOMINANCE
In 2020, I served as a surrogate for the Biden campaign because I believed in his pragmatic record of legislative and policy accomplishments. I didn’t agree with PresidentJoe Bidenon every issue, especially his decision to cancel Keystone XL, because it was more symbolic than substantive. No one energy project would have solved all of our energy problems, but Keystone XL represented a critical investment in domestic energy security, buoyed by years of environmental reviews, community engagement, permitting and industry planning. Canceling Keystone XL was wrong.
LikeKeystone XL, offshore wind projects, including Revolution Wind, in construction off Rhode Island, and a series of projects near completion, had gone through years of reviews and approvals. Multiple companies had expended billions into planning, workforce training and supply chain development. Thousands of American workers, including welders, steelworkers, engineers and electricians, were relying on these projects forsteady employment.
Canceling any energy project after construction has started doesn’t just delay bringing on much-needed sources of new energy, it also undermines the very foundation of how we do business in this country. If an approved project can be canceled because of thechange of administrations, why would any company risk the capital to invest in future energy infrastructure? The result is paralysis.

We are living through a period defined by both surging energy demand and increasing geopolitical instability. Families are struggling with high energy costs driven by bothconstrained supply and overregulation. The solution here is to pursue domestic energy resources of every kind.
In this environment, the commonsense strategy is not to pick winners and losers — but to pursue an ""all of the above"" energy policy that draws on every resource at our disposal, including oil, gas, nuclear, solar, hydro, and yes, wind. America should be producing more energy, not less. Both the Keystone XL and offshore wind cancellations undercut that vision. Instead of working to maximize capacity and diversify supply, they shrank the pie.
For decades, America’s debates over energy have been cast in zero-sum terms: oil and gas vs. renewables, coal jobs vs. clean technology, pipelines vs. wind turbines, with activists and industries battling it out in the courts and the court of public opinion. In reality, these false choices have done little to actually serve our energy, environmental or economic interests as Americans. We need them all – particularly homegrown, American-made sources of energy.

An ""all of the above"" energy strategy is not just good economics; it’s also good politics. Voters are tired of the pendulum swings, and tired of being told they have to choose one camp over another. They don’t want energy scarcity and blackouts. They want energy independence – something PresidentDonald Trumpaggressively campaigned on. They want America to lead, not lag. And they want jobs—whether those jobs are in the oil field, building state-of-the-art reactors or the shipyard assembling wind turbines.
Canceling Keystone XL was a mistake, and canceling permitted, financed and under construction wind projects is a mistake. If we are serious about achieving energy dominance, these are mistakes Americans just can’t afford.

U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpon Wednesday met with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in the city of Gyeongju – the final stop on his Asia tour aimed at securing new investment deals.
""The Republic of Korea is a cherished American friend and a close ally. And as we can see in this beautiful city, it's truly one of the most remarkable nations anywhere on earth,"" Trump said ahead of the meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit, adding that South Korea's president ""is a terrific person.""
During their bilateral meeting, Lee asked Trump to consider allowing South Korea to access fuel for conventionally armed, nuclear-powered submarines – a long-standing restriction under a U.S. nonproliferation deal.
Trump's previous stops during his trip included visits to Malaysia and Japan.
After hisvisit to Japanyielded roughly $490 billion in investment commitments, Trump said a trade deal with South Korea has proven more challenging as he seeks an additional $350 billion in U.S. investments. Trump predicted total new investment could reach upwards of $22 trillion in investments by the end of his first year back in the White House.

""I figure that we'll probably be at 20 or 21, maybe even $22 trillion ofinvestments coming into our countryby the end of the first year of my second term,"" the president said. ""And we had a tremendously successful first term. We had the strongest economy in history for our country, the strongest we ever had. But this is, I think, blowing it away. We have a great policy. We have some very good things happening.""
""Around the world, we're signing one trade deal after another to balance our relationships on the basis of reciprocity,"" Trump added. ""I've signed groundbreaking agreements with Malaysia, Cambodia, Japan, and our deal with the Republic of Korea will be finalized very soon. These agreements will be incredible victories for all of us, because everyone is better off when we have stable partnerships not plagued by chronic problems and imbalances.""
Speaking to business executives at the event, Trump described an ""economic revolution"" underway in the United States. The president urged the executives not to listen to ""small minds with no vision,"" pledging to ""build, trade, prosper and thrive together.""

Trump later received South Korea's Grand Order of Mugunghwa – the nation's highest honor – along with a replica of a royal crown from the ancient Silla Kingdom, symbolizing Seoul's recognition of his prior diplomatic efforts.
Trump’s visit coincided with new tensions on the Korean Peninsula after North Korea said it fired sea-to-surface cruise missiles off its western coast.
""He’s been launching missiles for decades, right?"" Trump said of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump reiterated his willingness to meet with the North Korean leader, saying, ""We had a really good understanding of each other.""

Trump also previewed his upcoming meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
""You know that President Xi of China is coming here tomorrow, and we're going to be, I hope, making a deal,"" Trump said. ""I think we're going to have a deal. I think it'll be a good deal for both. And that's really a great result.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-orders-managers-fire-civilian-workers-speed-conviction,Pentagon orders managers to fire civilian workers with 'speed and conviction',"Secretary of War Pete Hegseth says the project reflects the strength of the U.S.-Qatari alliance following Qatar's ""substantial role"" in the Gaza peace deal.
The Pentagonhas pulled key protections for its civilian workers and instructed managers to move with ""speed and conviction"" to fire underperforming workers, according to a memo issued last month.
The guidelines were issued on Sept. 30, just one day before the government shutdown, in a memo titled ""Separation of Employees with Unacceptable Performance"" to eliminate workers with ""unacceptable"" performance reviews.
""Supervisors and human resources (HR) professionals are directed to act with speed and conviction to facilitate the separation from Federal service of employees performing unsuccessfully,"" reads the memo signed by Under Secretary of War Anthony Tata, the Pentagon’s top personnel policy officer.
The memo also states that managers will be held accountable for not addressing ""poor employee performance.""

Some managers fear that the guidelines are too broad to where they could be used to fire anyone who does not support the Trump administration’s programs, according to The Washington Post.
It is unclear how many employees have been fired since the memo was issued last month.
""The Department is in the process of adapting to the new guidance outlined in Under Secretary of War Tata’s memo from September 30th and we have nothing specific to share at this time,"" the Pentagon said in a statement to The Washington Post.
Nearly half of the Defense civilian workforce have been furloughed during the ongoing shutdown. The administration attempted to fire thousands of furloughed employees earlier this month, but the effort was blocked by a federal court.

The civilian firings are part of a larger effort by Pentagon chiefPete Hegsethto eliminate the ""debris"" he purports is standing in the way of his mission to carry out Trump's agenda.
""The sooner we have the right people, the sooner we can advance the right policies. Personnel is policy,"" Hegseth said last month during a speech at Marine Corps Base Quantico.
The memo makes it easier for managers to fireDefense civilian workers, creating additional subjectivity for job performance evaluations.
Managers are directed to cite criteria used in federal job evaluations known as Douglas Factors, but each factor in the new memo added language that could impact some of those considerations.

""Every DoW position supports the mission, so deficiencies in any role can warrant strong action,"" the memo reads under the Douglas Factor section that involves an employee’s roles and responsibilities.
The factors allow managers ""flexibility to address performance issues swiftly and effectively,"" according to the memo.
""This approach empowers supervisors to act decisively when performance undermines DoW’s objectives, reinforcing a culture of excellence. Supervisors are to use the Douglas Factors in consideration of their action,"" the memo added.",10/28/2025
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/im-abigail-spanberger-why-i-want-virginias-vote-governor,I’m Abigail Spanberger. This is why I want Virginia’s vote for governor,"Cook Political Report senior editor David Wasserman breaks down major races in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City on ‘Fox News Live.’
Back in May, I spent a morning at a family-owned pharmacy in Hanover County — a locality that voted for PresidentDonald Trumpin 2024 by a margin of more than 25 points.
I was there alongside local pharmacists and students, a Hanover County mother whose daughter is battling cancer, and a crush of reporters to roll out my plan to lower Virginians’healthcare and prescription drug costsas their next governor. The event caught the attention of some community members who greeted me donning red T-shirts, Make America Great Again hats and Trump campaign buttons.
Among the group was a local Tea Party member. After we briefly joked about our party allegiances, the conversation quickly turned to the issues.

His daughter, who had been battling cancer, had recently lost her healthcare benefits. As her pile of medical bills and worries grew, so had his frustration.
LOOK BEYOND THE BIG APPLE'S SOCIALIST VICTORY TO FIND DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS IN 2025
What started as him leaving home on a rainy Wednesday morning to hold me accountable turned into a meaningful conversation about one of the challenges I hear about most from families, veterans, seniors and young people across our commonwealth — the rising cost of medical care.
But it’s not just high healthcare costs that are keeping Virginians up at night. Everywhere I travel across the commonwealth — since I first launched my campaign to serve as Virginia’s next governor, the No. 1 challenge Virginians share with me is thesqueeze of high costs. Rising rent and mortgage payments, energy bills and prices at the pharmacy counter are stretching Virginians’ paychecks thin. Virginians who are working hard to get by deserve a governor who is laser-focused on doing everything in her power to deliver them real relief.
Right now, as we race toward Election Day, I’m on the road for my 40-plus-stop, 11-day statewide bus tour. We’re going everywhere from ""Where Virginia Begins"" in Lee County up to Leesburg, from Norfolk to Nelson County to lay out the stakes in this year’s elections — because this year, Virginians have the opportunity to choose leadership that actually puts our commonwealth first.

Since that rainy morning in May, I’ve also rolled out my plans to lower Virginians’ housing costs and Virginians’ energy bills. I’ve rolled out my plans to grow workforce training opportunities — because a four-year degree isn’t the right path for everyone. And I’ve rolled out my plan to make sureVirginia’s public schoolsare the best in the nation. My opponent — Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor of Virginia — has not shown an inkling of interest in tackling these challenges. She’s laid out no real plans to make Virginia more affordable or grow our economy.
WITH LEGACY ON THE LINE, OBAMA HITTING CAMPAIGN TRAIL TO BOOST DEMOCRATS IN KEY GOVERNOR ELECTIONS
Virginians — including the more than 300,000 federal employees who call our commonwealth home — are grappling with the consequences of the Trump administration’s DOGE firings, use of this devastating government shutdown to escalate those firings and unpredictable tariffs. My opponent dismissed the devastating impacts of these cuts on Virginia’s economy and even mocked Virginians for worrying about losing their jobs. As Virginia’s next governor, I am clear-eyed about threats to our commonwealth — and I will always stand up for Virginians’ jobs and Virginia’s economy.
If you’re aregistered voter in Virginia, my name is on your ballot this year. You may still be making your mind up about who to trust with your vote. You might even be reading this right now and thinking, ""I’m a Republican, so why would I vote for a Democrat?""

I won my first campaign in 2018 — in a district that hadn’t elected a Democrat in 50 years — in part because thousands of Virginians asked themselves that very question. And ultimately, those voters believed in electing a leader who would put the people of Virginia — not a political party, not a group of donors and not a president — first.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/my-teachers-union-calls-representation-i-say-114-million-reasons-sue-them,My teachers union calls it representation. I say there are $114 million reasons to sue them,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
I am in my 33rd year of teaching public school — and my 30th teaching in New Jersey. I have been a member of theNew Jersey Education Association, our state’s largest teachers union, for as long as I’ve been teaching in the state. Union officials repeatedly told me that contributions to the union’s political action committee were voluntary and separate from our regular membership dues.
But during the current election cycle, I learned that the NJEA quietly sent more than $40 million from our dues to a political action committee — without the knowledge or consent of members, and without a shred of transparency.
Even worse, union officials used that money — including my money — to serve themselves. Those funds fueled former NJEA President Sean Spiller’s failed gubernatorial run, while he was still president of the union. Even when it was quite clear that Spiller had no chance of winning (he ended up finishing a distant fifth in the Democratic primary), PACs supporting him recklessly burned through piles of our dues money as Spiller was on the campaign trail — all while he somehow also served ""full-time"" as union president, collecting his enormous salary and benefits package from that job.
I feel betrayed. For years, an FAQ section on the union’s website plainly stated: ""By law, dues money cannot be used for partisan political campaigns."" But the NJEA seems to have done exactly what it had told members was against the law.
TEACHER UNION SENDS MAP ERASING ISRAEL TO ITS MILLIONS OF MEMBERS FOR 'INDIGENOUS PEOPLE'S DAY'
Schools count on teachers who are politically neutral. It doesn't work that way in New Jersey.(istock)
Over the past 12 years, a mind-blowing $114 million inteachers’ duesmade its way to Garden State Forward, a super PAC controlled by the union,according to state and IRS filings.
In the past two years, Garden State Forward sent more than $40 million to another union insider-run super PAC, Working New Jersey, and to a now-defunct group called Protecting Our Democracy, which called Spiller its chair. Both groups used teachers’ dues to promote his gubernatorial campaign.
I only learned of these PACs through various news reports in the midst of Spiller’s campaign, as mailers promoting his campaign (which I was apparently funding) started piling up at my door.
WE CAN’T ABOLISH AMERICA'S LARGEST TEACHERS UNION. BUT CONGRESS CAN DO SOMETHING ELSE
Now, I’m suing the NJEA along with another New Jersey teacher, with the help of the nonprofit law firm the Fairness Center. We believe that union officials misled us about how our dues money would be used, thus breaking our membership contracts, which represented that PAC contributions were voluntary. We’re also alleging the NJEA breached its fiduciary duty to prioritize members’ interests, not those ofunion insiders.
At the same time, the nonprofit New Jersey Policy Institute has alerted the IRS and the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission to potential problems with how the NJEA handled its political spending.
They say that the union appears to have failed to report itsmultimillion-dollar donationsto the Garden State Forward PAC as political activity, thus dodging tax rules. In an official request for an investigation, they also question whether the union skirted New Jersey’s cap on direct political donations — $5,800 per candidate in the race for governor — by using affiliated groups to give twice the legal amount to Spiller’s campaign.
RANDI WEINGARTEN GIVES TEACHERS GOOD ADVICE FOR ONCE
When questioned about my lawsuit and these filings, a union spokesperson hid behind carefully worded responses, citing ""representative democracy"" and ""the right of our members to join together in power.""
To be fair, here’s the entire quote from the New Jersey Monitor: ""‘NJEA is a member-led union that operates as a representative democracy. Our members’ decisions about which candidates to endorse and what resources to use in support of those endorsed candidates are made by our elected bodies,' said Steve Baker, the spokesperson. 'We will defend the right of our members to join together in power to advocate for our profession and our students.’""
We believe that union officials misled us about how our dues money would be used, thus breaking our membership contracts, which represented that PAC contributions were voluntary.

Sorry, but real democracy depends on transparency and accountability. The NJEA’s version is more like a bait-and-switch con game, designed to fool its members while union insiders spent their money supporting a lost cause.
How do NJEA officials think they can get away with this? Quite simply, I’ve seen them act untouchable by hiding the truthfrom teacherswhile instilling what feels to me like a culture of disrespect, fear, and intimidation among its members.

Does that sound like a healthy democracy to you?
My co-plaintiff and I believe that the NJEA’s dues-funded PAC spending spree broke its contract with teachers and violated its legal duty to represent our best interests.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/expert-reveals-3-headed-monster-crushing-american-college-graduates-as-trump-makes-strikes-on-h1b-visas,'3 headed monster': Expert reveals how H-1B visa program is crushing American college graduates,"Fox News Digital spoke to Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello about how the visa program needs to be fixed to give American workers more opportunity.
As theTrump administrationmakes moves to change the H-1B visa program to benefit American-born workers, Skillstorm CEO Justin Vianello backed those efforts in an interview with Fox News Digital while offering his expertise on other issues that need to be addressed with work visas.
Vianello told Fox News Digital that one of the ""biggest challenges"" with the current H-1B system is the ""impact"" on college hiring, particularly with computer science and computer engineering graduates.
Vianello explained that the unemployment rate for college graduates with those degrees is significantly higher than the average for all college graduates and there is a ""concerning"" level of unemployment with college graduates in IT.
""So that basically means they didn't need degrees for the jobs that they're currently in, being significantly under employed,"" Vianello said. ""How does the H-1B visa program impact that? Well, firstly, rough estimates are that there are about 730,000 H-1B holders in the U.S. and about 550,000 dependents. Most of them, in excess of 70% of them, are in IT.""
TRUMP’S H-1B VISA REFORM PLAN NEEDS TO PUT AMERICANS FIRST
The U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C.(Reuters/Jason Reed)
Vianello went on to explain that data shows H-1B visa holders are paid ""significantly less"" than their counterparts doing equivalent IT roles, which gives them a leg up with employers who are looking to pay less.
""I think it gets a little more broadly than that,"" Vianello said. ""In addition to competing with H-1B visa holders, college graduates, especially in IT, are also competing with OPT visa holders. This is optional practical training, basically an extension of the F-1 visa, which is a student visa, which allows you, if you're a STEM graduate, to work in the U.S. for three years following your graduation.""
""Now, the OPT visa holders don't pay Social Security or Medicare taxes, so they're automatically 15% cheaper, and they are typically paid 42% less than their U S counterparts. So as a college grad, you're fighting this three-headed monster. You're graduating with student debt, you've got H-1B visa holders and OPT visa holders who have the ability to take your job and cost an employer significantly less, and then you're competing with the third one, which is the ability of an employer to simply offshore that work.""
Many tech companies have embraced the H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialty occupations, but critics of the program say H-1B holders are often chosen over U.S. citizens for jobs. One of the reasons for this is that foreign workers are tied to their respective employers via the H-1B visa – as a company is required to sponsor the visa – and therefore quitting the job could ultimately see foreign workers losing their visa and their ability to legally remain in the country.
LABOR DAY CELEBRATION: HOW PRESIDENT TRUMP IS CREATING A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS

""The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,"" Tesla and Space X CEO Elon Musk posted on X last year as a rift inside the MAGA movement wasraging on the issue.
""The intention was good around bringing in people with skills and retaining people in the US that are doing skills and are studying in the universities,"" Vianello said. ""But the outcome to college grads that are competing for those roles has been really bad.""
Earlier this year, the Trump administrationunveiled a proposaldesigned to nudge employers toward offering higher salaries or reserving H-1B petitions for jobs that require advanced skills. The rule change, formally published in the Federal Register, came just days after President Donald Trump signed a proclamation introducing a $100,000 fee for H-1B visa applications.
The $100,000 fee — a one-time charge applying only to new H-1B petitions — will take effect in the next annual lottery, the system the U.S. government uses to select applications once the annual visa cap is reached.
""The whole idea is no more will these Big Tech companies or other big companies train foreign workers. They have to pay the government $100,000, then they have to pay the employee, so it’s just not [economical],"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters on Friday as Trump signed the order.
Vianello told Fox News Digital, ""Certainly I think that the $100,000 fee on any new applications is gonna go a long way toward changing behavior, but that's focused on H-1B.""

""We've seen quite a bit of news recently around changes to the OPT visa program as well in terms of limiting the number of visas and limiting the countries that they come from. That's gonna have a significant impact on the pipeline of people coming through as well. And so I believe those measures are gonna start changing the behavior of many of the employers.""
The argument from H-1B supporters that the United States is bringing in the ""best and the brightest"" is a sentiment Vianello pushed back on.
""In the last 18 months, according to layoffs.fyi, these large companies have laid off 250,000 tech professionals, but at the same time, the cap for H-1B visas was secured before the end of 2024 for the entire 2025, which is 85,000 people,"" Vianello explained. ""So you're laying off 250,000 U.S. tech workers, but you're applying for the maximum cap that you can for H-1B visa holders. That doesn't make sense. If there's a shortage of skills, why are you laying off 250,000 people? So you can see the way it's structured. It's being used as a labor arbitrage to bring down these large companies' tech costs.""
Vianello, who came here on a visa, told Fox News Digital he is not opposed to worker visa programs in general, but stressed they shouldn't leave American workers behind.
""I fully support using visas to attract top-tier technologists to the U.S. I came here on a Specialty Occupation Visa myself, which required my employer to invest significantly to bring me over,"" Vianello said. ""What I oppose is the misuse of programs like H-1B and OPT as tools for labor arbitrage, which undercuts entry-level opportunities for U.S. tech graduates and distorts the talent market.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americas-secret-weapon-crush-china-global-ai-race,America's secret weapon to crush China in the global AI race,"President Donald Trump joins ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ to discuss China’s restrictions on rare earth mineral exports, the legality of his tariff policies and his outlook for the U.S. economy.
The United States must win theglobal race for AI dominationagainst China. Our success depends on thriving innovation and robust investment – two integral pieces of our national battle plan.
But the third component of victory can’t be overlooked: The U.S. urgently needs evenbetter internet infrastructure. If we don’t extend our advantage in 21st-century connectivity, we will lose the fight for global AI leadership.
At this very moment, leaders in D.C. are debating the best approach to AI regulation. On the other side of the country, Silicon Valley is chasing the next breakthrough AI model. But even as the U.S. does both of those things, Beijing is playing a different game.
The Chinese Communist Party understands that AI supremacy depends on leveraging a national approach to building the infrastructure and connectivity required to develop and deploy advanced AI systems.(Getty Images)
TheChinese Communist Partyunderstands that AI supremacy depends not only on data and algorithms, but on leveraging a national approach to building the infrastructure and connectivity required to develop and deploy advanced AI systems. It is building internet infrastructure to leapfrog the U.S.
TRUMP'S AI PLAN IS A BULWARK AGAINST THE RISING THREAT FROM CHINA
For instance, China is challenging America’s long-standing leadership in Wi-Fi innovation by pushing its domestic standards internationally and directing resources into homegrown wireless technologies, both to the detriment of U.S. standards and technology, which have long led the way in Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi matters because it’s theprimary technologyconsumers use to access AI on their devices. The ability to move, process and deliver data at a large scale is the backbone of AI. Every generative AI query, self-driving vehicle and factory robot depends on light speed and reliable connectivity. If China takes the lead on any kind of internet infrastructure, it will soon take the lead on AI, too.
The good news is that the American cable industry has made significant progress in building broadband networks that offer the scale to meet this moment, with 87% already offering gigabit speeds, and even more powerful capabilities on the horizon. Over the past two decades, $340 billion in private capital has been invested to build these powerful networks, generating $568.7 billion in economic output in 2024 alone and supporting more than 1.3 million jobs nationwide.
CHINA'S MALIGN INFLUENCE TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF US LIFE. WE ALL NEED TO HELP STOP THEM
These infrastructure investments matter – but they must also be matched by commitment from government, as part of a national strategy to extend U.S. internet leadership. Such a strategy isn’t just crucial to AI's future use and reliability; it would also amplify the economic impact that such infrastructure has. In California alone, cable infrastructure supports 209,000 jobs and drives $117 billion in state economic impact. Texas and Florida each sustain more than 100,000cable-related jobs.
This is what national strength looks like: private capital fueling the public good. And with a national strategy for internet infrastructure, that good could be multiplied on a massive scale.
During a recent tech policy conversation I had with Rep. Brett Guthrie, the House Energy and Commerce Committee chair, he framed the choice starkly: ""We're not competing with Europe to regulate, we're competing with China to innovate."" He's right. Europe’s overregulation has already left them out of the AI race. The U.S. is still in the race, and if we hope to win it, we must continue to innovate and expand our internet infrastructure.
AMERICA MUST WIN THE AI RACE – AND PREPARE FOR THE WORST
Now is the time to leverage America’s strengths, doubling down on Wi-Fi capacity,broadband connectivity and the infrastructurethat makes them possible. For years, and because of far-sighted national policies, Wi-Fi has been the internet’s workhorse, handling the vast majority of all internet traffic and linking our homes, offices, schools and factories.
It’s also a uniquely American success story – one rooted in the value of permissionless innovation and rules that support the freedom to access public airwaves. Imagine if thefederal governmentmade that story even more successful by further expanding access to Wi-Fi. China wouldn’t have a chance in the AI fight.
Winning the AI race will require focus and urgency. As soon as possible, leaders in D.C. should create a national framework for broadband policy, replacing the current state-by-state regulatory minefield that holds back the infrastructure America needs.

We also need a better national policy on unlicensed spectrum – the radio frequencies that undergird Wi-Fi – to ensure our country’s continued Wi-Fi leadership. And we must maintain federal incentives that fuel private investment in internet infrastructure to meet AI’s massive data demands.
If we get this right, the United States won’t just compete in the AI era – we’ll indisputably lead it and leave China in the dust. The same networks connecting Americans today will secure our economic success, our technological leadership and our national future tomorrow.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/spaving-not-saving-could-cost-you-up-50000-out-your-retirement,"‘Spaving’ is not saving. It could cost you up to $50,000 out of your retirement","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Let’s face it — Americans have mastered the art of justifying bad money decisions. We tell ourselves we’re being smart shoppers, but in reality we’re sabotaging our wallets with a sneaky little habit called ""spaving"" — spending more money in the name of ""saving"" money.
You’ve seen it. You’ve probably done it. You’re checking out online, your cart says $42, and you see that dreaded $8.99 shipping fee. So, what do you do? You add another $50 worth of items you don’t need just to get ""free"" shipping. Congratulations — you just spent $50 to save $9. That’s not saving. That’s financial ruin.
It’s the new American pastime with the proliferation of speedyonline shopping.
GROCERY BILLS IN AMERICA: HERE ARE THE MOST AND LEAST EXPENSIVE CITIES
Retailers are laughing all the way to the bank because they’ve figured out something most people don’t realize about money. We hate losing more than we love winning. The idea of ""missing out on a deal"" triggers a little emotional panic, and our brains convince us we’re saving money when we’re actually overspending.
Those special deals we find online don't necessarily save money.(iStock)
It’s why ""Buy One, Get One Free"" signs exist. You didn’t need the second sweater. You didn’t even want the second sweater. But somehow, paying more felt like saving more. That’s the twisted logic of ""spaving."" It’s why the word ""sale"" doesn’t always equal deal.
And it’s not just about online shopping.
TOP 5 OVERPAYMENT SCAMS TO AVOID
You might drive 20 minutes out of your way to save 10 cents a gallon on gas, only to burn more than that in fuel getting there. You might stock up on enough toilet paper to survive an apocalypse because it’s ""cheaper per roll,"" while that same $40 could’ve been invested or paid toward debt. You might buy the ""family value"" meal because it’s a better ""deal,"" then waste half of it in the fridge.
Each decision feels like a smart move in the moment. But add them up over a year, and you’ll find hundreds, sometimes even thousands, of dollars that evaporated in the name of you thinking you were saving. Glad that college education could pay off.
Here’s the harsh truth aboutyour family finances.Small leaks sink big ships. The road to financial success isn’t paved with coupons and ""limited-time offers."" It’s built on discipline, delayed gratification and a deep understanding of where your money actually goes.
When you’re ""spaving,"" you’re not saving — you’re consuming. And every dollar you waste now is a dollar that could’ve been compounding foryour future retirement.
PROGRESSIVE CITIES FACE BILLIONS IN ECONOMIC LOSSES AS RETAIL CRIME SURGES 93% SINCE 2019
Let’s do a little math.Suppose you ""spave"" just $100 a month. That’s $1,200 a year. If you invested that same amount annually for 20 years at a modest 7% return, you’d have over $50,000. That’s the cost of all those ""deals"" that felt too good to pass up.
It’s also why most Americans stay stuck in the same financial rut. They think they’rebeing responsible shoppers,but they’re feeding a habit that’s the opposite of wealth-building.
You might drive 20 minutes out of your way to save 10 cents a gallon on gas, only to burn more than that in fuel getting there.
We’ve confused saving with spending less aggressively. Real savers don’t look for excuses to buy, but instead they look for reasons not to buy. They buy what they need, when they need it and they let the rest sit.
Here’s a challenge: next time you see a ""spend more to save more"" offer, stop and ask yourself the financial acid test:

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/white-house-says-government-shutdown-could-eliminate-next-inflation-report-despite-optimistic-numbers,White House says government shutdown could eliminate next inflation report despite optimistic numbers,"National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett joins America’s Newsroom to discuss a new report showing inflation cooling, the latest on the U.S.-China trade conflict, and President Donald Trump’s response to a Canadian ad criticizing tariffs.
The White House claimed Friday that the government shutdown could delay or eliminate the next inflation report, causing economic fallout.
The Rapid Response 47 account on X wrote Friday, ""The White House has learned there will likely NOT be an inflation release next month for the first time in history.""
""Due to the Democrat Shutdown, surveyors cannot deploy to the field — depriving us of critical data. The economic consequences could be devastating,"" the post said.
PresidentDonald Trump,meanwhile, celebrated a strong stock market performance, as newly released Labor Department figures showed that inflation for the month came in at a better than expected 3%.

WHAT FED MUST DO NOW AFTER JEROME POWELL'S JACKSON HOLE EPIPHANY
That's the highest since January and up from 2.9% in August. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices also rose 3%, down from 3.1% in the previous month. Cooler inflation data for September sent Wall Street surging Friday.
""THE STOCK MARKET IS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE BECAUSE OF TARIFFS!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.
It comes as investors bet on anotherFederal Reserverate cut following the new inflation figures.
Core inflation, excluding food and energy, also eased to 0.2% monthly and 3.0% annually, showing modest cooling, while gasoline prices — the biggest driver of inflation — surged 4.1% following several months of declines.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt hailed the figures in a statement to Fox News Digital.
""Inflation came in below market expectations in September thanks toPresident Trump’s economic agenda,"" Leavitt said.

""This is good news for American families, and it’s a shame the Democrats are using them as leverage to fund health care for illegal aliens.Democrats choosing to keep the government closedwill likely result in no October inflation report, which will leave businesses, markets, families, and the Federal Reserve in disarray,"" Leavitt said.
""Because surveyors cannot deploy to the field, the White House has learned there will likely NOT be an inflation release next month for the first time in history,"" the administration added in an emailed statement to The Associated Press.
Republicans have blamed the shutdown on Democrats, arguing that they refused to fund the budget in an attempt to reinstate taxpayer-funded medical benefits for illegal immigrants through Democrat lawmakers' continuing resolution, which would include extending the expiring Obamacare tax credits.
Democratic leadership has disputed the claims, saying that Trump and Republican lawmakers are really behind the shutdown.
The report comes as the broader economy shows steady growth but slower hiring, creating a mixed picture for consumers and markets.

Rents rose just 0.2%, the smallest yearly gain in nearly four years, while consumer prices increased 3% in September from a year earlier, the highest since January, and up from 2.9% in August.
The figures show that inflation continues to rise more slowly than many economists expected when Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in April. Economists estimate that the tariffs are adding roughly 0.4 percentage points to annual inflation.
Some of those duties were later reduced as part of trade deals, while many companies have only passed on part of the tariff cost to consumers out of concern that doing so would reduce sales. Businesses may shift more costs to consumers in the coming months if the duties appear permanent.
TRUMP BLASTS ‘TOO LATE’ POWELL AGAIN, THREATENS LAWSUIT OVER FED’S $3B HQ RENOVATIONS
The smaller increase will come as a relief to the Federal Reserve, which has signaled it will cut interest rates again next week — the second time this year — even as inflation remains above its 2% target.
Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, echoed Leavitt’s optimism, saying the latest numbers show inflation continuing to move in the right direction despite theshutdown pause in reporting.
""This is actually a really great report,"" Hassett told Fox News. ""The market is responding appropriately to good news, because 48 Bloomberg economists said this number was going to go way up. If you look at core CPI — the measure economists rely on most — it was down from August, below expectations and headed in the right direction.""

""The top-line number was slightly higher only because of a refinery shutdown in September that temporarily drove up gas prices, but those have already come down,"" he said. ""The next time we get a CPI release, once the government reopens, we’ll see even further reductions in inflation.""
Hassett added that the brief rise in gas prices doesn’t change the overall outlook, pointing to steady progress in cooling inflation.
""The bottom line is the markets are responding not because they think inflation is going up, but because they believe, as we know is true, that inflation is headed in the right trajectory,"" he said.

New York City mayoral candidateZohran Mamadanilaughed off how his plan to increase taxes on New Yorkers might impact them, suggesting those complaining about his plans are making a mountain out of a mole hill.
During an appearance this week on ""Andrew Schulz’s Flagrant with Akaash Singh"" podcast, Mamdani defended his proposals to raise the corporate tax rate, shift more of the tax burden to ""richer and whiter neighborhoods"" and add a flat 2% income tax on earners making over $1 million — insisting his plan wouldn’t drive anyone out of the state. His critics, including Independent mayoral candidate and former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, disagree.
""The same people who will say, ‘Oh, we can’t afford free buses. We can't afford $700 million a year in making the slowest buses in America fast and free –'"" Mamdani began during a discussion about how to best use political capital to benefit New Yorkers, before he was interrupted by the host of the podcast, Andrew Schulz.

""You keep taxing businesses and wealthy people in New York City, there will be nobody left,"" Cuomo argued. ""Well, Mamdani is a socialist Democrat, his answers are always the same — tax business, tax the rich, raise taxes, raise taxes, provide everything free. Free transportation, free food.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americas-allies-finally-paying-fair-share-defense-now-must-pay-bills,America’s allies are finally paying their fair share for defense. Now they must pay their bills,"Energy Secretary Chris Wright joins 'America's Newsroom' to react to Trump's statements at the UN regarding NATO allies purchasing Russian oil and energy amid its war with Ukraine.
Days ago, PresidentDonald Trumpthreatened Spain with new tariffs unless Madrid increases its defense spending to 5% of its GDP. Whether this tactic proves effective remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: the president has been even more effective than he was in his first term when it comes to getting other nations to honor their commitments. This fact has been most prominent when it comes to defense spending.
In 2006,America’s NATO alliesagreed to spend 2% of their GDP on defense. After several years of little progress, the Obama administration secured an updated agreement in 2014 that all would achieve this goal by 2024. Yet when Trump first entered office in 2017, only five of 28 nations had met that mark.
The president and his national security team, including me, pressed our allies hard back then to live up to their commitments. By 2021, the number of NATO members doing so had doubled and allied military spending increased considerably.

On the summit agenda was a new defense investment plan that raised the target for defense spending to 5% of GDP.(Omar Havana/Getty Images)
Fast-forward to 2025. Aided by the ongoing war in Ukraine and a European fear of Vladimir Putin, Trump managed to achieve what many thought impossible: convince our NATO allies to spend a whopping 5% of their GDPs on defense!
In the economic space, the White House has similarly persuaded other nations to live up to past obligations when it comes to trade, using tariffs and other means where necessary to do so. This should be more apparent when it comes to futuretrade talks with China.
The communist state has violated its obligations and reneged on numerous agreements for decades, from the theft of intellectual property to currency manipulation and the unfair subsidization of Chinese companies. During Trump’s first term, for example, the PRC notably never purchased the $200 billion in additional U.S. exports it had promised.
China may be the most notorious country when it comes to reneging on commitments, but it’s not the only one. Many of America’s friends are also culpable, especially when it comes to deals made with U.S. companies. I have seen this during my own time in the private sector.
This is enough of a problem that the House Appropriations Committee recently wrote in the August report of their FY2026spending bill for national security, Department of State and related programs that it ""continues to be concerned by reports of commercial disputes between United States entities and host governments….""
The committee noted ""particular concern"" about ""disputes over real property seized, held or expropriated by foreign governments."" The report went as far as to call out the governments of the ""Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Honduras, Kuwait, and Mexico.""
Allegedly, Mexico’s state-owned oil company Permex owes American contractors $1.2 billion. Kuwait is purportedly accused of not paying the U.S. for its financial obligations – including for its Al Zour refinery, one of the largest oil refinery projects in the Middle East – where it reportedly has left U.S. and other contractors unpaid.
And, per theState Department, many U.S. companies operating in Honduras have ""voiced concerns regarding politically motivated threats of criminal prosecution and expropriation of private assets.""

The committee concluded its report by directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio ""to utilize the various tools of diplomatic engagement to…. facilitate the timely resolution of such disputes."" Such action, of course, begins with America’s diplomats abroad.

U.S. ambassadorswho are already on station in foreign capitals facing such matters should press their host governments on all levels. As should those persons being put forward to the Senate for such assignments – beginning with Amer Ghalib, who testified Thursday at a hearing to be America’s next ambassador to Kuwait (currently the only vacant post in the House Committee’s call out list).
Further, a separate congressional hearing on the broader issue of foreign governments allegedly backpedaling on their agreements with U.S. companies would also be quite helpful.
The administration has appropriately spoken about protecting U.S. jobs, preserving American innovation, and ensuring fairness when it comes to global trade and business. We have seen the president’s team act on these instincts. And given the business backgrounds of many in the administration, they surely appreciate the challenges that American companies face when addressing business disputes with foreign governments.

Just as the president did this year by getting ourNATO alliesto live up to their spending commitments when it comes to bolstering the alliance, applying this same focus and energy to help U.S. firms resolve their disputes with foreign governments would go a long way to helping American companies and workers.
If our allies and friends want the benefits of partnership with the United States, they must also honor their commitments – to our country, our businesses and our workers. That’s another good way to put America first and promoteU.S. economic growthand prosperity.

Unleash Prosperity's Vote With Your Feet campaign tracks data from the IRS and other agencies to createinteractive mapsshowing how population and wealth are moving across the country. The campaign site has interactive maps depicting the movement of people and money, as well as their politics.
Moore said that while the first ""big wave"" of migration the group tracked in the U.S. occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, as residents of closed blue states moved to open red states, the pattern goes beyond that.
""Our study looks over the last 10 years. So, it's not just the COVID effect,"" he explained.
The former Trump administration economic advisor said ""there's no question"" that the country's politics will becomemore polarizedif the population shift continues. Moore said it used to be that New Yorkers going to Florida would vote for Democrats in the Sunshine State. But now, he said, those moving out of New York and New Jersey are doing so for ideological reasons as well as economic ones. He also noted that Florida and Texas have become more red, not more purple, as people flee blue states.

Moore declined to comment on specific candidates running for New York City mayor or New Jersey governor, but he said that politicians looking to hold those offices should know that ""raising taxes in New Jersey or New York would be a disaster.""
""I believe if New York were to raise its income taxes — [like] some of the politicians are talking about — that Wall Street would no longer be located in New York City. It would move out,"" he said. Moore touched on New Jersey as well, saying that many residents are fleeing the state because of its high taxes.
""New Jersey is the third highest taxed state in the country — one of the highest income taxes, one of highest business taxes — and small businesses and big businesses can't do business there anymore. So, the policies need to be reversed,"" he told Fox News Digital.
The four states that have lost the most people and the most income are New York, California, New Jersey and Illinois, according to Moore. He pointed to a common denominator that all four states share —""very, very high taxes.""
In addition to taxes and politics, Moore said crime and bad schools are other factors pushing blue state residents to flee. He said he sees crime as another kind of tax.
Billboards launched by Unleash Prosperity Oct. 23, 2025, warn New York and New Jersey residents about the mass exodus from their states.(Unleash Prosperity)
""I think crime is a tax. And if you can't feel safe walking down the streets of your neighborhood, you're going to want to leave,"" he said.
Moore also said that if blue states were to allowschool choice— a move that some say would allow low-income families to give their children better educational opportunities — they would see fewer residents leaving.
Moore said red state lawmakers, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, have handled crime control well and have kept taxes low, something he said are the keys to their success. He said lawmakers in blue states should aim to be more pro-business, to fight crime and to get rid of ""all of the things that make cities today unlivable."" He pointed to the example former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani set when the Republican cleaned up the country's most populated city.

While he had criticisms of lawmakers in blue cities and states, Moore pointed to examples of Democrats who were doing well with population retention: San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and Houston Mayor John Whitmire.
Moore described Lurie as a ""very pro-business, moderate Democrat"" and said he is ""cleaning up"" the city and that people are returning. Moore said Whitmire was a ""no-nonsense"" lawmaker who is fighting crime, cutting expenses and keeping taxes low.
""That's what Democratic mayors and governors should be doing if they want to save their cities and states,"" Moore said.

Americans in some cities are spending nearly four times more of their incomeon groceriesthan others, a new analysis shows, with the hardest-hit households mainly in the Midwest and South.
Residents of Detroit spend the largest share of their income on groceries — nearly 3.8% — followed closely by Cleveland and Birmingham, Alabama, according to anew reportfrom personal finance website WalletHub. At the other end of the spectrum, residents in Fremont, California, spend less than 1%.
""In the cities where people spend the most money on groceries, residents often have low incomes on top of seeing high sticker prices on common grocery items,"" said Chip Lupo, WalletHub writer and analyst.

Detroit and Cleveland have some of the lowest median household incomes in the country — $39,575 and $39,187, respectively, according to Data USA.
Cities with higher living costs such as San Francisco and San Jose, California, meanwhile, typically have higher incomes that balance out expenses.

The top five cities where residents spend the most on groceries are Detroit; Cleveland; Birmingham, Alabama; Newark, New Jersey; and Toledo, Ohio.
The five cities where residents spend the least are Fremont, California; San Jose, California; San Francisco; Irvine, California; and Gilbert, Arizona.
Grocery prices have climbed nearly 30% since beforethe COVID pandemic, according to federal data, and rose by as much as 0.6% between July and August, marking one of the largest monthly increases in the past three years.

To conduct its survey, WalletHub selected 26 grocery items covering a broad range of common household items, including meat, dairy, vegetables and fruits,frozen foodand cleaning products, Lupo told Fox News Digital.
Meat and dairy prices drive most of the grocery cost gaps nationwide, with items like chicken, milk and eggs varying sharply by region, Lupo said. Produce tends to fluctuate less, he said.
Meat prices are fueling the biggest differences in grocery costs across the country, a WalletHub analyst said.(iStock)
Those in lower-income cities like Detroit and Cleveland, said Lupo, feel a bigger squeeze because even modest grocery bills eat up a larger share of limited paychecks, while people in high-income cities such as San Francisco and Washington, D.C., can better absorb inflated prices.

Lupo said grocery prices have also risen more sharply in the Midwest and parts of the South than in many coastal cities.
""Midwest cities like Detroit and Cleveland and southern cities such as Birmingham show some of the highest grocery costs relative to income.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/boston-eyes-city-run-groceries-fight-food-insecurity-skeptics-remain-doubtful,"Boston eyes city-run groceries to fight food insecurity, but skeptics remain doubtful","New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani unpacks his plans to reshape the Big Apple and make the city affordable, addresses his relationship with the NYPD and more on 'The Story.'
Boston officials are weighing whether the city should open government-owned grocery stores to make fresh, affordable food more accessible — an idea that’s gaining traction inNew York City.
After holding a hearing earlier this month, city councilors agreed to study how other cities have implemented municipal markets to close gaps in food access.
Councilors Ruthzee Louijeune and Liz Breadon,who called for the hearing, did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital.
ATLANTA’S CITY-RUN GROCERY SEES EARLY SUCCESS, SPARKING DEBATE OVER GOVERNMENT’S ROLE
While Boston leaders are still exploring the idea,Atlantahas already put the concept into practice, opening its first city-run grocery store earlier this year.
Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens told Fox News Digital that Azalea Fresh Market has served more than 20,000 customers since it opened its doors on Aug. 28.

""In its first month, fresh produce made up 11.6% of total sales, exceeding the national average of 10% and highlighting a community demand for healthier food options,"" Dickens said, adding that the turnout shows how strong the need was in a neighborhood ""long underserved by grocers.""
""Azalea Fresh Market is proof that when we work together as a city, we can deliver real solutions that change lives,"" he added.
The early success in Atlanta comes as similar ideas gain momentum elsewhere, including in New York City, where Democratic mayoral candidateZohran Mamdanihas championed city-owned grocery stores as part of his controversial campaign platform.
Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist upstart, has placed affordability at the center of his agenda tolead America’s largest city. He has campaigned on free buses, rent freezes for tenants in rent-stabilized apartments and city-owned grocery stores.

But not everyone is convinced city-run grocery stores are the right solution.
Ryan Bourne, a top economist at the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute think tank, told Fox News Digital that ""Boston’s flirtation with city-run supermarkets is a bad idea.""
""Government doesn’t become Costco by proclamation,"" he said. ""Private stores have specialized knowledge about their sector and a profit incentive that encourages them to be efficient. Without those things, a public grocer would likely run things badly, it would only ‘work’ to deliver low-priced food through extensive permanent subsidies.""
Bourne warned that taxpayer-backed subsidies or tax breaks could turn a public grocery into ""a badly targeted, in-kind welfare scheme,"" adding that heavier subsidies to cut prices could lead to ""in-store queues, empty shelves from shortages, and products being resold on black markets.""

Judge Glock, director of research and a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital that ""city-run grocery stores, like most city-run businesses, tend to do poorly."" He pointed to a government-backed store in Kansas City that shut down despite a nearly $20 million investment.
""There is little justification for the government competing with for-profit grocery stores,"" Glock said, noting that supermarkets already operate on some of the slimmest profit margins of any major business. ""Further eroding those profits through subsidized competition would only make it harder for regular grocery stores to provide food for their customers.""
John Peluso, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, told Fox News Digital that government-run grocery stores are ""ineffective at reducing the overall price of groceries.""

""They require taxpayer subsidization to operate at low margins in areas of low profitability — and those costs are ultimately passed on to the taxpayer,"" he said.
He added that if cities truly want to improve food access, they could achieve more by easing taxes and regulations for all grocers. ""If municipalities reduced or eliminated taxation and regulations for everyone, free-market entrepreneurs would flood into cities like Boston, eliminating the issue at its source,"" Peluso added.

Peluso also argued that community-based organizations, not governments, are better equipped to help low-income families.

https://www.foxnews.com/weather/drought-conditions-leave-pumpkin-farmers-empty-fields-smaller-crops,Drought conditions leave pumpkin farmers with empty fields and smaller crops,"Many pumpkin patches won't look the same this year as drought conditions across the United States leave farmers with empty fields. Farmers said they have harvested at least 15% fewer pumpkins this year.
CROSS PLAINS, Tenn. – Many pumpkin patches won’t look the same this year as drought conditions across the United States leave farmers with empty fields.
The National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska estimates around 38% of the United States is experiencing a ‘moderate drought,’ which the National Weather Service defines by damaged crops, low water wells and developing water shortages.
Pumpkin farmers — including those in Cross Plains, Tennessee – are dealing with drought conditions for a second straight year. Stephen Freeland’s pumpkins are growing in 14 acres of bone-dry soil. He said the pumpkins are trying to adapt to dry conditions, but many of them aren’t surviving.
""Because of the drought. I don't know. We probably dropped 15 to 20 percent,"" Freelanad said.""It's just a roulette of the rain. Who gets the rain and when?""

Freeland plants pumpkin seeds in June and July. He said the first set of pumpkins harvested received adequate water and came out normal. However, the seeds he planted later endured weeks of heat — but with no rain.
""The thing with pumpkins, when it gets 95, 98 degrees, the pumpkin plant wants to abort the fruit that it just pollinated,"" Freeland said.
When it gets too hot, Freeland said pumpkin plants start to wilt, and their flowers fall off more easily. On a warm day, the flowers stay open for shorter periods of time, which affects pollination.
Farmers say long periods of heat with no rain can cause pumpkin plants to wilt, which affects pollination.(Fox News)
Farmers have found ways to alleviate the stress caused by the drought. Freeland added drip irrigation lines to his pumpkin field by pumping water from his well. A water line then allows smaller amounts of water to drip directly onto a plant's roots.
Agricultural adaptation can be costly and force farmers toraise their prices, although their pumpkins are smaller.
""The downside is if you need to raise prices, but your size is not there, that makes it a little more difficult,"" Freeland said. ""They're just smaller, less marketable.""
Some farmers installed drip irrigation lines to slowly drip water directly onto the pumpkin's roots.(Fox News)
COSTCO SHOPPERS RAVE OVER SEASONAL PIE THAT'S NEARLY 4 POUNDS AND LESS THAN $6
Katie Osborne’s family farm includes 20 acres of pumpkins and 70 head of cattle. Osborne doesn’t run an irrigation line through her farm, because she said the cows need water from the ponds to stay hydrated.
""We pray a lot, for rain at those critical times,"" Osborne said. ""We don't want to irrigate the ponds, because we don't want to take away the water source from the cattle.""
Osbourn said her farm produced about 30% fewer pumpkins than usual this year. She said timing is key to staying on top of next year’s weather, but it’s too late to do anything about this year’s harvest.
""We also need to be strategic. We know that we will get more rain in late May, early June,"" Osborne said. ""Some of our prize-winners and larger jacks, we need to go ahead and plant them at that time.""

Freeland and Osborne said an abundance of rain could do more harm than good, especially as the ground is dry and hard. They're hoping for a gentle rain that the ground can soak up before they begin planting their winter crops.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/farmageddon-trumps-trade-war-shutdown-crushing-heartland,Farmageddon: Trump’s trade war and shutdown are crushing the heartland,"Farmers in southern Illinois say drought, high costs, and China’s trade freeze are driving soybean profits below break even this season.
I warned in May thatAmerica’s farm economywas under attack — that tariffs, Agriculture Department program cuts and political posturing in Washington were hammering farmers from the farm gate to the dinner plate. Four months later, that picture has only grown worse.
Across the Midwest, combines sit idle and bins overflow with unsold grain. Corn prices are down nearly 50% since 2022. Soybeans have dropped 40%. Fertilizer and equipmentcosts are up double digits. And 8 in 10 farmers now say they believe the U.S. is on the brink of another farm crisis reminiscent of the 1980s. They’ve even given it a name: Farmageddon.
This time, the crisis isn’t a result of macroeconomic conditions — it’s a direct result of decisions made by the White House. PresidentDonald Trump’s reckless tariff war is crushing America’s farmers.

Take soybeans.China has retaliatedon U.S. tariffs with a total boycott of U.S. soybeans, leaving bumper crops rotting in silos across Ohio, Iowa and Illinois. Meanwhile, new tariffs on fertilizer, steel and equipment have driven up production costs for nearly every crop and commodity.
TRUMP'S TARIFFS FORCE CHINA TO FEEL THE HEAT
The math doesn’t pencil out: higher costs on the front end, lower prices and fewer markets on the back end. It’s a squeeze no amount of wishful thinking can fix.
And while U.S. farmers struggle to move their grain, the administration just finalized a bailout for Argentina — a country that turned around and cut a deal with China to buy its soybeans instead of ours. Think about that: Washington is bailing out a competitor to our farmers on the brink of crisis.
Unfortunately, we saw this same movie during Trump’s last trade war. Farm bankruptcies soared to record highs, andBrazil walked awaywith our export markets. Now Argentina is lining up to do the same. And everyone knows that once you lose market share, you rarely get it back.
This isn’t just economics. It’s deeply personal. It’s the difference between keeping the family farm for another generation and auctioning off the tractor. It’s the creases across anOhio farmer’s faceas he struggles to tell me he’s not sure whether he wants his children to have this way of life.
TRUMP IS USING THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN TO DO SOMETHING NO PRESIDENT HAS EVER DONE
And the White House is only making it harder. Despite total control of Washington, the president’s party has shut down the government rather than extend enhanced premium tax credits that keep healthcare affordable. Finding affordable healthcare as a farmer is difficult enough as it stands. But now, premiums are set to skyrocket. In fact, in rural countries, they are set to increase an average of 107%, a larger increase than in our cities.
Moreover, when USDA shuts down, farmers get shut out. That means delays to critical farm loans, conservation payments and disaster relief. For farmers, it’s a double whammy: no markets, no safety net, and now, no one to pick up the phone.
What is the solution? Well, the president is floating a $14 billion bailout for farmers — a temporary fix for a self-inflicted wound. We saw how this went in the first trade war, when payments were mismanaged and failed to help the farmers who were the hardest hit.
Even the president’s allies are skeptical. I agree with Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va., who said funding bailouts with tariff revenue is ""like putting a Band-Aid on cancer."" Farmers don’t want bailouts; they want a fair shake. They want open markets, stable policy and a government that has their back.
So let’s be clear: There is a way out of this mess.
ARE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S TARIFFS ACTUALLY WORKING?
First, reopen the government and extend the enhanced premium tax credits that a quarter of all farmers rely on. It’s time to get the USDA back to full strength and ensure that rural families can afford their health coverage.
Second, end the trade war that’s hollowing out American agriculture. Stop punishing the very people who feed and fuel this country.
Third, if the president won’t endhis reckless trade war, Congress must step in to reclaim our constitutional authority over tariff policy. I plan to introduce legislation soon that would require USDA to report on the impact of any proposed tariffs on farm country, giving farmers an extra tool to plan for the future. I welcome my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join.
And finally, let’s expand domestic markets by authorizing year-round E15 fuel. This is a commonsense, bipartisan step that would boost corn demand, lower gas prices and strengthen our energy independence.

This is only a start, but our farmers need a real plan.
Because what’s happening in farm country isn’t some distant problem. It’s America’s problem. When farms go under, towns go quiet. When farmers stop buying seed, tractors and feed, the hardware store closes, the diner empties, and the local school loses its tax base. The ripple effects reach every kitchen table in America — in the cost of food and in thestrength of our economy.
President Trump can end this crisis today byreopening the governmentand ending the trade war that’s driving farm country to the brink. And if he won’t, Congress should step up and do it for him.

Because this isn’t just about crops or commodities. It’s about a way of life that feeds our nation, fuels our economy and defines who we are.

CBS News staffers will not be disciplined if they fail to informtheir new bossabout what they do all day, according to an internal memo the Writers Guild of America East sent to its members.
Last week, CBS News employees were told they had until Tuesday to outline their daily duties for new editor-in-chiefBari Weiss, but the Writers Guild of America East — which represents some CBS staffers — urged them to hold off until the network addressed a list of union questions.
""The company responded today and informed us that you will not be disciplined if you do not respond to the email, indicating that a response is optional. The company further stated that if you choose to respond, it will not be a basis for discipline, discharge, or layoff,"" the Guild wrote in a memo that has been obtained byFox News Digital.

""We intend to hold the company to these responses. The company's complete response to our questions is below,"" the Guild continued. ""As a union, it's important that we continue to exercise our right to make sure that management provides necessary information, sets clear expectations, and follows the contract that you have all worked so hard to win.""
Weiss, who began serving as CBS News' new editor-in-chief last week after Paramount CEO David Ellison officially purchased her outlet, The Free Press, said she plans to hold ""both American political parties to equal scrutiny."" She asked staffers to outline their roles and what they believe is or isn’t working — a move that prompted union concern and a detailed inquiry to management.
The Guild requested a list of everyone who received the email from Weiss, who will have access to responses provided by employees, whether responses will be the basis for ""discipline, discharge or layoffs,"" what consequences, if any, would stem from not responding, an explanation of what CBS plans to do with the responses, details on whether CBS will use artificial intelligence to review emails and an outline of steps taken to prove the results will be ""non-discriminatory.""

CBS told the Guild that the entire news division received the request, and the ""intention is that only Bari Weiss and her chief of staff will see the responses, though they may have an obligation to share with other senior executives.""
The media company insisted that nobody would be disciplined or laid off because of their answers, and it was simply requested so that Weiss could ""get to know the employees and use it as a discussion guide as she meets with employees in the coming weeks and months as time permits.""
CBS also said it would not use A.I. to review responses.

A segment on CBS’ ""60 Minutes"" Sunday night suggested record-high stock market levels under PresidentDonald Trumpcould be a precursor to another crash similar to 1929.
Host Lesley Stahl spoke with CNBC’s Andrew Ross Sorkin about his upcoming book""1929,""which explores the economic and social buildup to the 1929 stock market crash.

Construction robots are no longer a far-off idea. They're already changing job sites by tackling repetitive, heavy, and often dangerous tasks. The latest robot comes from Australia, where a spider-like machine named Charlotte is making headlines.
Charlotte is designed to3D printan entire 2,150-sq-ft home in just one day. That's equivalent to the speed of more than 100 bricklayers working simultaneously. This offers a glimpse into how thefuture of housingmight be constructed.

AUSTRALIA DEBUTS FIRST MULTI-STORY 3D PRINTED HOME – BUILT IN JUST 5 MONTHS
Charlotte the robot 3D prints homes in just 24 hours using eco-friendly materials.(Crest Robotics)
Charlotte is a collaboration between Crest Robotics and Earthbuilt Technology. The robot doesn't simply stack bricks or tie rebar. Instead, it uses a giant extrusion system that lays down eco-friendly material in layers.
That material comes from sand, crushed brick and recycled glass, all locally sourced. The result? A structure that's fireproof, floodproof and created with a far smaller carbon footprint than traditional building methods.
SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BUILT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL
This 3D printing construction robot stands out for its unique mix of speed, strength, versatility and affordability.
While Charlotte is still in the development phase, a scaled-down prototype has already been showcased. Researchers believe it could help solve housing shortages where labor is scarce and construction costs are skyrocketing.
Its spider-like legs let it climb and build higher, cutting costs and saving time.(Crest Robotics)
Charlotte's creators also have their eyes set on the stars. They imagine future versions of therobot buildingmoon bases for research and exploration. With its compact design and autonomous operation, Charlotte could adapt to the extreme environments of space just as well as it can to the challenges on Earth.
THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST
If Charlotte delivers on its promise, it could reshape how homes are built worldwide. Faster construction means quicker housing availability. Lower costs and sustainable materials mean more affordable homes with a smaller environmental impact. For anyone facing rising housing prices or construction delays, technology like Charlotte may bring a ray of hope.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-america-needs-tax-incentivize-tradesmen-not-just-college-graduates,"Why America needs to tax-incentivize tradesmen, not just college graduates","FOX Business’ Mike Rowe and Jeff Flock join 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss why a growing number of high school graduates are skipping college and moving into the workforce.
Walk onto anyconstruction site in America, and you’ll hear the same story: We can’t find enough skilled workers. Electricians, welders, HVAC technicians, plumbers and heavy-equipment operators are in dangerously short supply, and the gap is widening.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently warned that building America’sartificial intelligence infrastructurewill require an army of electricians.The demand for data centers — both cloud and AI — is expected to double year over year. Mike Rowe has been sounding the alarm for years: The most ""essential"" jobs are the ones our culture stopped celebrating.
Here’s the truth: Without skilled tradesmen, America grinds to a halt. No power. No housing. No data centers. No cloud. No AI.
Welder Cedric Smith from the documentary ""Skilled.""(Photo courtesy of 3M)
Yet we keep pushing young people toward four-year degrees, often leaving them with six-figure debt, while treating the trades as a second-class option. Meanwhile, a ""silver tsunami"" is coming as baby boomers and Gen X tradesmen are retiring faster than replacements are entering the field.
HELP WANTED: US MUST FILL LOTS OF SHIPS-AND-CHIPS JOBS TO BEAT CHINA
According to Rewiring America, we’ll need 1 million additional electricians in the next decade, on top of today’s workforce of about 800,000.
Failing to emphasize andincentivize skilled workisn’t just a cultural mistake. It’s an economic time bomb.
Fixing the Imbalance: Use the Tax Code
The quickest, fairest way to reverse course is through thetax code.
Here’s our proposal: Create aggressive tax breaks for tradesmen themselves, not just the companies that employ them.
If you choose to become an electrician, welder or plumber, you should enjoy the same level of government support that college graduates receive.
TRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND
If we can make tips non-taxable for service industry workers, we can certainly extend that logic to the men and women literally rebuildingAmerica’s infrastructure. And, frankly, it’s absurd that our active-duty service members or full-time first responders pay federal income taxes at all.
Want to attract a new generation into these professions? Incentivize the behavior that sustains the nation’s backbone.
By their late 20s, these tradesmen could be debt-free, earning solid middle- to upper-class wages, buying homes and raising families; not just chasing the American Dream, but rebuilding it.
Compare that with manycollege gradstoday who are burdened by debt, underemployed and watching automation threaten their jobs.
We should reward the work America’s future depends on, not funnel kids into a path that may not exist a decade from now.
This is also about national security
This isn’t only an economic issue, it’s a national-security one.
AMERICA HAS THE POWER TO LEAD THE AI REVOLUTION – AND THE LEADERSHIP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN
The Pentagon already warns of labor shortages in shipbuilding and mission-critical infrastructure. Data centers — the central nervous system of AI and national defense — are desperate for electricians and cooling technicians.
Without a robust pipeline of skilled tradesmen, our ability to compete with China in the AI race collapses before it begins.
Our national security depends as much on the American welder and HVAC tech as it does on the fighter pilot. It’s time our policies reflected that truth.
This isn’t a subsidy; it’s an investment
Critics will call this a giveaway. They’re wrong.
Tax incentives aren’t handouts. They’re investments in the backbone of America, in the men and women who keep the lights on, the water running and the servers cool.
If Washington can shovel billions into green-energy dreams and Ivy League programs producing fragile, perpetually offended graduates, then it can certainly afford tax relief for the Americans who actually build, wire and power this country.

The conservative answer is clear: Reward hard work, build self-reliance and restore dignity to the trades.
Congress should act now
Year after year, calls for reform fall on deaf ears in Washington, especially among Democrats more interested in partisan shutdown theatrics than solving the real problems facing working Americans. It’s time to stop putting politics above people and startrebuilding the middle classthat keeps this country running.
Congress can start by:

This is simple, fair and fiscally sound. The alternative is to watch American growth and resilience grind to a halt.

Nearly half of the IRS workforce — nearly 34,000 employees — faces furloughs as thegovernment shutdownenters its second week, with the agency rolling out a contingency plan to keep key tax enforcement, data security, and filing-season operations running despite the lapse in congressional funding.
In a letter to staff Wednesday, the agency said most operations would shut down. The contingency plan, which takes effect Wednesday and runs through April 30, 2026, details how the IRS will operate without new congressional funding.
As of July 24, 2025, the IRS employed 74,299 people. During the shutdown, only 39,870 — about 54% — will stay on duty, though it’s unclear which positions will be retained.
Key operations that will continue to includetax processingto safeguard government revenue, IT and data-protection systems, criminal investigations, case work involving bankruptcies and liens, and disaster-relief support. However, taxpayer services — including call centers and most administrative functions not tied to life or property protection — will be suspended.

The IRS’s Lapse Appropriations Contingency Plan outlined operations for the first five business days of the shutdown and said the agency would continue limited operations using Inflation Reduction Act funding.
The furloughs stem from afunding impasse between President Donald Trump and Congressthat has forced a government shutdown with no clear resolution.

National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwaldsaid the shutdown has cut off Americans from vital IRS services.
""Expect increased wait times, backlogs and delays implementingtax law changesas the shutdown continues,"" she said. ""Taxpayers around the country will now have a much harder time getting the assistance they need, just as they get ready to file their extension returns due next week. Every day these employees are locked out of work is another day of frustration for taxpayers and a growing backlog of work that sits and waits for the shutdown to end.

""For frontline employees, the complete lack of planning left them in the dark about their work status until their supervisor informed them today,"" Greenwald added. ""This is not the way our government should treat its dedicated, nonpartisan public servants. We urge the administration and Congress to reach an agreement that reopens government and restores the services that Americans need and deserve.""
According to The Associated Press, the IRS told employees they would receive back pay once the shutdown ends. The Trump administration warned Tuesday that back pay for furloughed federal employees is not guaranteed.

Oren Cass, founder of the Washington-based think tank American Compass, has built a reputation as one of the right’s most outspoken advocates for economic nationalism and ""strategic decoupling"" from Beijing.
Yet recent details about the group’s corporate partnerships and staff affiliations raise questions about consistency between its rhetoric and its operations.
In essays and media appearances, Cass has argued that the United States must take a tougher stance towardChinaand prioritize domestic manufacturing and independence from Chinese supply chains.
In a 2023 Foreign Affairsessay, Cass and a colleague warned that the U.S. ""must break from China or else become irrevocably corrupted by it,"" arguing that economic interdependence had already ""weakened America’s industrial base and constrained its political will.""
MAJOR COLLEGES FACE HEAT OVER CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP TIES AS ESPIONAGE CONCERNS MOUNT

In the same essay, Cass and his co-author argued that China’s influence extended deep into U.S. research and policy institutions.
""China has long targeted U.S. universities, think tanks and research institutes to extract economic gain and advance its own ideological agenda,"" they wrote, adding that such organizations ""must accept processes and controls designed to ensure the integrity and security of their work.""
They went further, calling for legal restrictions. ""U.S. law should be changed to prohibit these institutions from entering into any partnerships with China-based and affiliated entities. Any funding flowing from one nation's institutions to the other's must be stopped.""
Lawmakers from both parties have long raised concerns that theChinese governmentexploits educational exchanges, research partnerships and business investments in the U.S. as cover for espionage activities. These warnings have intensified in recent years amid growing scrutiny of Beijing’s influence operations on U.S. soil.

On July 28, 2025, Cass joined a group of policymakers and national security experts in aletterto Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick expressing ""deep concern"" over the decision to resume exports of Nvidia’s H20 chips to China.
The group warned that the Trump administration’s move ""represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States’ economic and military edge inartificial intelligence."" He reiterated his stance during aconversationon Steve Bannon’s ""War Room"" podcast where he argued against lifting export restrictions on advanced computer chips bound for China.
CHINA'S MALIGN INFLUENCE TOUCHES EVERY ASPECT OF US LIFE. WE ALL NEED TO HELP STOP THEM
And yet, Cass’s uncompromising rhetoric on China appears at odds with the realities of operating a Washington think tank in a globalized economy.
In June 2025, American Compass hosted a lavish fifth-anniversary gala at Washington’s National Building Museum, an event underwritten in part by Qualcomm, BlackRock, and Google — companies whose global operations remain deeply intertwined with China’s economy.

China is the world’s second-largesteconomyand a key trading partner for U.S. companies, making such financial entanglements common across Washington’s policy landscape.
Fox News Digital reached out to Qualcomm, BlackRock and Google for comment; none responded before publication.

What's more, American Compass’s staffing and advisory relationships have also prompted questions. The organization’s director of events and operations previously worked for Alibaba Group, one of China’s largesttechcompanies.
Additionally, an economist on the group’s advisory board is also a professor at Peking University’s Guanghua School of Management, a leading business institution with close ties to China's Communist Party.
Cass and American Compass did not return multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital.
While none of these associations are illegal or unusual in Washington, they complicate Cass’ image as a champion of economic separation from China and highlight the difficulty of pursuing that ideal while relying on corporate sponsors.

At 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday, the federal government entered its firstshutdownsince 2018, after two competing funding proposals, one from Democrats and another from Republicans, failed in the Senate. The setback deepened the stalemate, with neither side showing willingness to concede.
Though once uncommon,government shutdownshave grown more frequent in recent decades as political brinkmanship has become a hallmark of budget negotiations.
Since 1976, the U.S. government has experienced 20 shutdowns. The most recent one, the longest in U.S. history, occurred when a dispute over funding for PresidentDonald Trump'sborder wall halted government operations for 34 days, spanning from December 2018 into January 2019.
HOPES DIM IN PREDICTION MARKETS AS TRADERS BET GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN WILL DRAG ON FOR WEEKS
Trump on Monday evening blamed Democratic lawmakers for the shutdown, saying he’d be ""happy to work with the Democrats on their failed healthcare policies"" once the government reopens.
""Democrats have SHUT DOWN the United States government right in the midst of one of the most successful economies, including a record stock market, that our country has ever had,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""This has sadly affected so many programs, services, and other elements of society that Americans rely on — and it should not have happened.""
""I am happy to work with theDemocratson their failed healthcare policies, or anything else, but first they must allow our government to re-open,"" he added.

Previous government shutdowns have tended to be more about political drama than economic disruption, with markets and jobs recovering quickly afterward.
However, this shutdown, stretching into its first week, comes as the Trump administration warns that furloughs across the federal government could become permanent. Typically, furloughs are temporary; onceCongressresolves the standoff, employees return to work and receive back pay.

Government regulations have been largely responsible for causing the shortage.
Studies from the National Association of Home Builders show that federal, state and local regulations account for nearly 24% of the price of a new single-family home and more than 40% of the cost of new multifamily housing. Zoning limitations that restrict density, lengthy permitting programs that draw out projects over years, and building codes that differ significantly from one jurisdiction to another all create unnecessary costs and lost time. For some metro regions, it takes over a decade to transition a project from conceptualization through completion.
If the Trump administration does indeed choose to declare anational housing emergency, its resulting emergency plan should not seek to micromanage local housing markets or build new federal bureaucracies. Instead, it should focus on clearing away the obstacles that make it harder for the private sector to meet today’s growing demand for housing.
HOUSE PRICES SKYROCKETED UNDER BIDEN. NOW, GUESS WHO DEMOCRATS WANT TO BLAME?
Wherever stringent restrictions have been imposed upon developers or landlords, housing availability has contracted and affordability has gotten further out of reach. Conversely, where markets are freed to act – when permitting is streamlined, financing is accessible and development is allowed to respond to demand – housing has become more plentiful and prices have stabilized.
California shows how this plays out. For decades, stringent zoning and environmental vetting brought building close to a halt, leaving the state short almost 1.3 million units , according one recent estimate. By contrast,states like Texas, which moved more quickly on permitting and allowed higher-density development, have seen faster growth in supply and more moderate price increases even as their populations expanded. In fact, home prices are declining faster in Texas than any other state.
Instead of following states like Texas’ lead and tackling the root causes of the housing shortage, Washington, D.C., continues to scapegoat the private sector.
Take, for example, the trend of blaming rent pricing software.
CON MAN ZOHRAN MAMDANI WANTS TO IGNORE REAL CAUSES OF NYC'S AFFORDABILITY CRISIS
Launched under PresidentJoe Biden, this effort wrongly blames technology tools that give real-time housing pricing. Targeting AI may make for nice sounding press releases, but it’s no different than blaming the weatherman for the rain. This technology just reports on what the market is bearing and regulating it away does nothing to put more homes on the market or reduce costs for families.
Or how about the federal and state lawmakers who have chosen to point fingers at housing investors? A study led by New York University’s Joshua Coven found that markets with greater institutional investment saw both an increase in available rental housing and a measurable drop in rents. This is because large-scale investors add to the pool of available rentals, which can ease competition and moderate costs.
In other words, when investment is welcomed and new units are built, families benefit directly through lower costs and more options.
What does this all mean?

Well, instead of seeing its role as one of restricting market activity, the Trump administration should view its job as one of increasing it. Because the only way to solve an affordable housing shortage is to build and invest more.
One approach could be to catalyze reform at the state and local level by making some programs and grants conditional on removing artificial limitations on construction, such as outdated zoning restrictions that prohibit multifamily development in high-demand areas.
Another could be to streamline federal permitting for infrastructure projects that support housing, such as roads, utilities and transit. These projects frequently get delayed and become more costly or less likely to get constructed as they languish, and streamlining would encourage builders to construct more.

The White House has already prioritized enactingeconomic policiesthat have freed workers and businesses from unnecessary burdens – ending taxes on tips and overtime, reducing red tape, and promoting growth through opportunity. Housing deserves the same treatment: less government interference and more room for private investment.
This approach has worked before. Federal leaders just need to let it work again.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/five-ways-trump-administration-can-save-american-dream-prevent-socialism,Five ways the Trump administration can save the American Dream and prevent socialism,"Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram and Fox News contributor Kim Strassel join 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the government shutdown and the escalating tensions between parties.
Young people are demoralized and are turning to the promises of socialism. While socialism is entirely decoupled from reality, young Americans are frustrated, believing that the American Dream is out of reach. In a recent survey, almost a third of Millennials and nearly 40% of Gen Z said they believe they will never own a home.
While wrongly identifying capitalism as the culprit for the ills of cronyism and central planning, including monetary and fiscal policy that has increased the cost of living, their concerns are real and valid. Whereas in the past, there have been periods with high interest rates with reasonable home prices, and periods with low interest rates and high home prices, would-be homebuyers today are contending with both.
If a home is the physical embodiment of theAmerican Dream, it shouldn’t feel out of reach. Here are some suggestions to once again make the American Dream attainable.
FAITH IN AMERICAN DREAM DWINDLES AMID SOUR ECONOMIC SENTIMENTS, POLL FINDS
Lower mortgage rates through more assumable loans
It is estimated that less than a quarter of mortgages in the US are assumable. Many homebuyers financed or refinanced their homes during the Fed’s 15-year low-interest rate bonanza and therefore, don’t want to sell their homes and give up their low mortgage interest rates. This has clogged up the housing market.
Furthermore, today’s mortgage rates, coupled with high housing costs, are making the homes that are available too costly.
Thegovernment should workwith the banks to make more mortgages assumable (of course, making sure the assuming party is creditworthy, and perhaps limiting that to homes that will be primary residences).
While banks generate sizable fees from loan originations, right now, the clogged market is limiting their business anyway. If loan assumability came with a right of first refusal for the lending institution to refinance the remainder needed for the mortgage, it would be a win-win. Banks would increase originations and the blended rate would be lower for homebuyers.
Plus, taxpayers have helped the banks out a lot, to put it mildly, over the past few decades, sogetting some concessionson their side is quite fair.
Create incentives for smaller footprint housing
One of the reasons that housing is so expensive is that we have had square footage creep. Homes today, on average, are more than double the size they were in the 1950s. Per US Census Bureau data, new construction homes averaged 983 square feet in the 1950s, 1,200 square feet in the 1960s, around 1,500 square feet in the 1970s and are between 2,200 and 2,300 square feet on average today, even though the household size has shrunk. Note that median data for the period was similar.
It's acomplicated matter. Why would a homebuilder choose to build a smaller home when they could make a bigger profit on a larger one for an incremental amount of extra work?
This is where tax incentives, both locally and federally, could help prompt builders to build smaller footprint housing that would also be more affordable, particularly for young people.
Fix balance sheets by solving the student loan burden
Even if a house is in range of a potential homebuyer’s earnings, if they are saddled with debt, making a home purchase becomes a non-starter.
TheUS governmentis the largest predatory lender in the country, saddling teenagers and young adults with tens of thousands of dollars in debt and delaying their ability to make investments, while enriching colleges and their administrators. Getting the government out of student lending and thereby making colleges and universities right-size education costs to the value the education provides will clean up young people’s personal balance sheets and help make homeownership more attainable.
You can read more of my thoughts onhow to do that here.
Address rising property taxes and insurance
It’s one thing to be able to afford buying a house. It’s quite another thing to afford the ongoing carrying costs. Property taxes and insurance have become incredibly cumbersome. It is reported that, on average, taxes and insurance make up almost a third of single-family mortgage payments, and for 9% of single-family homeowners, taxes and insurance comprise more than half of the mortgage payment.
There should be an effort, even if undertaken at the local level, to dial back these costs, or fewer Americans will never be able to afford a house (not to mention the overall questionable moral framework for property taxes).

Address corporations buying single family homes
This is an area that I wrote about extensively in my last bestselling book, You Will Own Nothing. Before 2010, there was effectively no institutional money buying single-family homes. But, in Q1 2025, nearly 27% of single-family homes purchased were bought by investors, with some portion of that being institutional buyers.
Many of the institutionally-backed companies convert single-family homes they purchase torental properties, taking those dwellings out of the buyable supply and renting Americans back a shadow of the American Dream.

While I hate central planning and prefer free markets, there has been nothing free market about the advantages that give these companies the ability to get cheap capital and go in and compete for single-family homes. Additional fees, taxes or limitations, at least until the market is normalized, could be a good way to level the playing field for average Americans.
The housing problem may be temporary, as baby boomers will eventually age out and sell their homes. However, it is still worthwhile to come up with solutions today, even if short-term, to make owning a home a realistic, attainable, goal for hardworking Americans.

Here's why losing your job might be the best break of your life,"Mike Rowe Works Foundation founder Mike Rowe discusses how AI is impacting new college grads and how he’s working to help people get into more trade jobs on ‘The Story.’
No economy is immune to layoffs, and with the increased implementation of artificial intelligence and the unprecedented adjustment of last year's employment numbers, it seems likely that we've entered a period where RIFs are common. Lufthansa Airlines announced its plan tocut 4,000 administrative jobs by 2030, and Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JPMorgan Chase, just said the world’s largest bank will be ""fundamentally rewired"" for the new AI era.
These are two of many examples that represent massive, disruptive changes to oureconomyand our way of life. And while most of us will eventually be affected in one way or another, we don't have to flounder without hope. Whether you’ve already been let go or worry that you might be next, the key is to change the way you see yourself, making the prospect of transition less frightening and possibly even liberating.
The core problem for many who lose theirjobsis that they define themselves too narrowly, limiting their identity to a single role or industry. When layoffs hit, they feel boxed in and unable to pursue work beyond their last position. That often leaves them afraid, depressed and even victimized.
WHITE HOUSE PREPARES FOR 'IMMINENT' FEDERAL LAYOFFS AFTER DEMOCRATS FORCE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN
Without denying the challenge of being laid off, I'd encourage employees going through the process to take a more complete, insightful view of who they are and what they are meant to do. To do that, they need to see themselves in terms of the unique, transferable gifts they've been given, which can be applied to a wide variety of jobs in just about any industry.
One of the best ways I know to identify those gifts is through the idea of ""Working Genius."" There are six types of work that show up in every job, in every industry:
The truth is, none of us is good at all six. Every person in any industry has two types of work that give them energy and joy; this is where your Working Geniuses lie.
JOBS THAT ARE MOST AT RISK FROM AI, ACCORDING TO MICROSOFT
On the other hand, everyone has two types that drain them and that they don’t do well. We call those Working Frustrations.
The remaining two types of work fall somewhere in the middle, neither particularly energizing nor draining. We call those Working Competencies.
Here's a question that everyone going through a layoff needs to consider: How much harder will it be to find a job if you don’t understand your geniuses and frustrations — and if you don’t realize those gifts aren’t tied to one role or one industry?
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
To answer that question, let's consider an example. Let’s say you’re a computer programmer, and your company decidesAIcan do the bulk of your work. If you only see yourself as a programmer, your job hunt is going to feel desperate and discouraging because you’ll be competing with a flood of other programmers for fewer positions.

But if you look instead at your natural, transferable geniuses, everything changes. Let's say that your geniuses are Invention and Tenacity. That means you enjoy developing novel ideas and then pursuing solutions diligently until they are finished.
As you look for a job, you can now look far beyond programming and even technology, exploring a much broader spectrum of job opportunities that need someone with your geniuses. In doing this, you’ll realize that there are plenty of roles in a wide variety of industries that need someone like you, and that your prospects of success and job satisfaction will be much higher in a job that fits your talents.
Ironically, you might find that your previous job didn't exactly allow you to use your geniuses. Many people get jobs in fields they studied in school, and many just fall into a job by circumstance. But intentionally pursuing acareerthat aligns better with their geniuses can lead to them realizing that getting laid off, as hard as it may have been, was exactly what they needed.

Of course, no job is perfect. We all must do things that don’t perfectly align with our strengths. But when we spend most of our time working in our geniuses, we find meaning and fulfillment. When we don’t, we feel stuck.

What we need is a paradigm shift, to move from thinking purely about our role and industry and instead focus on our God-given abilities. The world needs those gifts. And when you find a job that lets you use them, you might just look back and see the layoff not as a curse but as a blessing.

A startling trend sweepingcollege campusesacross the country is causing concern as students turn to untraditional ways to turn quick cash while in school.
Shayna Loren, 21, is in her senior year as an advertising major at Boston University. When she was 18, Loren approached her parents with a business proposal – she wanted to start posting content on OnlyFans.
OnlyFans – a website that allows adults to produce and monetize sexually explicit content – has become increasingly popular for college students looking to make a quick buck tocover tuition costs.

""I talked to my parents, wrote up a business plan and was like, ‘Hear me out, I know this is crazy, but just give this a chance.’""
Loren’s parents agreed to what she viewed as a ""research project,"" and she began posting.
""I blew up,"" Loren said. ""And I haven’t stopped since.""

Three years later, Loren has leaned into her status as a student, looking to market herself to viewers wanting to consume explicit content specifically from the college category.
""Pretty much everyone relates to having a crush, whether they were in high school or college, and being able to look across the classroom and see them,"" Loren said. ""And so for me, I just pushed that fantasy by showing it on social media – that I am that college dream girl.""
The soon-to-be college graduate has cemented herself as a popular creator on the platform, boasting over 700,000 followers just on Instagram. Loren was able to use the money she made from posting content to cover the cost of her college tuition and help her parents retire – solidifying an attractive sales pitch to fellow students looking to do the same.

However, experts warn the temptation of making fast cash comes with significant safety risks for college students surrounding posting explicit content online, especially if they reveal personal details about themselves to their subscribers.
""They are putting themselves in danger because some men start to believe that the girl is putting on this act for them personally,"" Dr. Carole Lieberman, a forensic psychiatrist, told Fox News Digital.

""[Their viewers] believe that they are the ‘Only Fan’ who she really cares about, even loves, and that she wants to have sex with them. They develop a fixation on the girl and want to find her in real life to ‘consummate’ the relationship.""
OnlyFans did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
Members of law enforcementhave also voiced their concerns regarding the potential for stalkers seeking out young girls posting to the platform who may be more focused on the funds over their own security.
""Today’s youth is living in two worlds, the cyber world and the real one,"" Bill Stanton, retired NYPD officer and author of the book ""Prepared, Not Scared,"" told Fox News Digital. ""What I see happening is that for some those lines become blurred, sometimes with dire outcomes. Creating a fantasy for those paying into an OnlyFans account may not be enough for some wanting to take a perceived online relationship into the real world.""

The risk of online interactions spilling into real-life threats for OnlyFans creators is nothing new for Rock Jacobs, director of a documentary series about the online platform infiltrating college campuses called ""Lonely Fans,"" who recalled a disturbing secondhand account he was told while filming.
""There’s one guy that literally drove five hours to a girl’s house,"" Jacobs told Fox News Digital. ""[He] broke into her house and was living in her attic.""
""The stalkers can be digital, but it can actually turn physical and real – and in some cases, it can get violent.""

Jacobs also pointed to another woman’s testimonial featured in the documentary.
""She’s done really well [and] she’s made over a couple million dollars,"" Jacobs said. ""She’s been able to change her entire life and set herself up. But she admitted that every night when she goes to sleep, she feels like someone’s going to break into her house and murder her. She said she’s come to terms that she’s not going to have a peaceful death.""
The startling reality is not lost on Loren, who is careful not to walk alone on campus at night and insists she keeps her personal safety top-of-mind while creating content on OnlyFans. However, she believes that the risk of stalkers may be more prevalent among smaller creators who monetize the illusion of a personal relationship with their subscribers – and are often everyday students looking to have an extra stream of income while studying.

""Once you reach a certain level, people realize that this is a job, and there is more of a boundary between work and their personal life,"" Loren told Fox News Digital.

They want the most money, and so they want guys to be in love with them. And that’s where it starts to get scary, and people can become very attached.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/agency-targets-individual-americans-small-businesses-must-reformed,This agency targets individual Americans and small businesses — it must be reformed,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on where things stand as the government shuts down for the first time since 2019 on ‘Fox News @ Night.’
As someone whose life’s work is helping small businesses navigate our nation’scomplex tax system, I have witnessed firsthand how the Internal Revenue Service has become an outsized force that too often targets those least equipped to fight back. While the agency has long maintained that its enforcement efforts are focused on large corporations and the ultra-wealthy, the truth is that small businesses and middle-class families bear the brunt of its actions.
The IRS often investigates businesses that take advantage of legal tax breaks, and it's a lot easier for them to go after the little guy than to take on the armies of lawyers and accountants that big businesses have at their disposal. This imbalance is not only unfair, but it is also damaging our economy, killing jobs and undermining the entrepreneurial spirit that defines America.
In March, former IRS whistleblowers Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler were promoted to leadership positions at the Treasury Department with the mandate of reforming the IRS. This is a welcome development. Shapley and Ziegler certainly have their work cut out for them.
SEN RICK SCOTT, REP BYRON DONALDS: TRUMP AND BESSENT'S IRS REFORM: LET’S END JOB-KILLING POLICIES
Time and again, IRS audits fall disproportionately on small businesses and individuals making less than $400,000 a year.Larger corporationscan afford to absorb the burden of lengthy audits, but for a small business, an audit can be devastating. The process is time-consuming, expensive and distracting, often forcing business owners to divert resources away from serving customers, paying employees and growing their companies.
A 2023 Government Accountability Office report revealed that more than 90 percent of audits are against middle-class families and small businesses under the $400,000 threshold. It is clear that major corporations and billionaire tax cheats are not the primary targets in the IRS’s crosshairs.
Thankfully, the previous administration’s desire toexpand the IRSby tens of thousands of new agents was thwarted by President Donald Trump, who announced a hiring freeze in January to protect small businesses and middle-class families from being swept into an audit dragnet. But, Trump’s action also underscored a critical truth: the IRS still wields immense power with far too little accountability, and without serious reform, that power will continue to be abused.
The broader economic consequences of this imbalance are enormous. Small businesses are the backbone of job creation in America, yet they are being discouraged from investing, hiring and expanding because they fear the IRS will punish them for success.
I have spoken with countless entrepreneurs who quietly hold back on growth because they don’t want the extra scrutiny. Thischilling effectis invisible to most policymakers, but it is real. When entrepreneurs choose caution over expansion, jobs are not created, innovation is stifled and communities miss out on economic opportunity.
Meanwhile, the compliance burden gives large corporations a competitive advantage, because they can hire teams of professionals to handle audits and disputes while smaller firms are left exposed. The result is a system that entrenches big business and suppresses competition, the exact opposite of what a healthy free-market economy should promote.
We can and must do better.Reforming the IRSshould begin with rebalancing its priorities. Enforcement is important, but it should not come at the expense of fairness and service. Congress should establish clear limits on how many small business returns can be audited each year and require the IRS to justify its audit selections with transparent metrics. Independent appeals processes must be strengthened so that small businesses can contest government overreach without going bankrupt in the process.

Any new IRS funding should be redirected toward improving taxpayer services, simplifying compliance, and providing timely guidance. The IRS should also be required to publicly report audit outcomes, including how many audits end with no changes or in favor of taxpayers, so Americans can see for themselves whether enforcement is being carried out fairly.

Small businesses are not asking for special treatment; they are asking for a level playing field. They are willing to pay their fair share, but they should not be disproportionately burdened simply because they lack the resources to fight back. America’s prosperity has always been built on the backs of entrepreneurs willing to take risks and create opportunities. If those individuals believe every step forward might trigger a costly audit, many will hesitate and our economy will suffer.
For the sake of fairness, for the sake of growth and for the sake of America’s entrepreneurial spirit, we need toreform the IRSnow. An agency that punishes the vulnerable while letting the powerful escape scrutiny is not serving the people. A tax system that discourages job creation is failing the nation. If we want small businesses to thrive and the economy to grow, we must put the little guy back on an equal footing and make the IRS accountable to the people it is meant to serve.

CORNYN TAKES SWING AT JAMES, SCHIFF WITH NEW LETITIA ACT TARGETING 'CROOKED POLITICIANS'
The anticipated shuttering of Fannie and Freddie in New York comes after the Department of Justice opened an investigation into James' personal mortgages in May, when Federal Housing Finance Agency chief Bill Pulte sent a criminal referral to the department back in April over claims James falsified mortgage records to obtain more favorable loans.
A Norfolk, Virginia, home James purchased in 2023 is at the heart of the investigation. James identified the home on mortgage documents and a Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac form as a property that would serve as her primary residence, according to the criminal referral Pulte sent the Department of Justice in April.
James is legally required to live in New York as a statewide elected official in the Empire State.

The criminal referral also cited past reported issues with James' properties, including a 2001 purchase of a Brooklyn, New York, property. The certificate of occupancy lists the property as a five-unit residence, while James' mortgages list the property as four units, which could affect mortgage agreements.
James has denied wrongdoing, including her office telling theNew York Timesin April that a separate loan application for the 2023 Norfolk, Virginia, home purchase reportedly indicated she would not live at the property full-time, and that her mortgage agreement did not require her to occupy the property as her primary residence.

TheU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development(HUD) accused congressional Democrats on Tuesday of forcing a government shutdown, warning that the ""Radical Left"" is putting vulnerable families at risk while pledging to keep critical housing services operating.
""The Far Left is barreling our country toward a shutdown, which will hurt all Americans,"" a HUD spokesperson told Fox News Digital.
""At HUD, we are working to keep critical services online and support our most vulnerable. Why is the media more focused on a banner than reporting on the impact of a shutdown on the American people?""

In a memorandum circulated to all federal agencies late Tuesday, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought confirmed that government funding expires at 11:59 p.m. and instructed departments to execute their plans for an orderly shutdown.
""President Trump supports passage ofH.R. 5371, but it is now clear that Democrats will prevent passage of this clean CR prior to 11:59 p.m. tonight and force a government shutdown,"" Vought wrote.
The OMB director said Democrats were blocking theHouse-passed measureover ""insane policy demands,"" including $1 trillion in new spending, and warned that the length of the shutdown is ""difficult to predict.""
Employees were told to report for duty to begin shutdown activities until a new appropriations bill is signed into law.

Brad Knott, R-N.C., joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the latest on bipartisan negotiations amid a looming government shutdown as Sen. Chuck Schumer says he will not support a short-term stopgap bill.
Past government shutdowns have been more political theater than economic shock, with markets and jobs bouncing back quickly.
This time, though, PresidentDonald Trump's warning that some furloughed workers may not return to their jobs raises the stakes, turning a routine disruption into a threat to an already fragile labor market.
If Trump carries out that threat, it would almost certainly face an immediate court challenge. But if it stands, a shutdown usually dismissed as partisan brinkmanship rather than financial disruption could deliver lasting economic consequences.
SHUTDOWN EXPLAINED: WHO WORKS, WHO DOESN'T AND HOW MUCH IT COSTS
Robert Conzo, CEO and managing director at The Wealth Alliance, a financial advisory firm, said that such a move would mark uncharted territory.
""If the U.S. federal government dismisses workers instead of furloughing them, I believe the labor market may see a shock with a higher unemployment rate and initial jobless claims,"" Conzo told Fox News Digital.

""The big question to me is whether Trump is using this as a headline negotiation tactic or as a turning point to lower federal spending in the future. I believe using a government shutdown to dismiss federal workers would be unprecedented and face a myriad of questions. Federal workers typically are covered by civil service protections, as such, they need to be dismissed with cause,"" he added.
The government is set to shut down at 12:01 a.m. ET on Wednesday ifCongressfails to approve a funding extension. A shutdown requires federal agencies to send home workers in roles that are not considered essential. These furloughs are temporary; once Congress resolves the standoff, employees are brought back and receive back pay.
Each week of a shutdown trims about 0.2% from U.S. economic growth, though that loss is typically recouped once federal workers return and agencies reopen.
PARTISAN STANDOFF THREATENS CRUCIAL ECONOMIC DATA, LEAVING FED — AND FAMILIES — IN THE DARK
The job market is already on shaky ground. The Washington, D.C., home to a large share of federal workers, has been hit especially hard after Elon Musk’sDepartment of Government Efficiency(DOGE) advisory board pushed for layoffs earlier this year.
Asked how many federal workers could be laid off, Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday, ""We may do a lot,"" placing the blame squarely on Democrats for the stalemate.

The Trump administration is preparing to oversee what could be the largest mass resignation in U.S. history, with more than 100,000 federal employees scheduled to leave under its deferred resignation program.
At the same time, federal agencies have drafted plans for sweeping layoffs if lawmakers fail to strike a deal, raising the stakes for a workforce already bracing for upheaval.
And the timing couldn't be worse: those workers are stepping into a job market that has been losing momentum, withunemploymentrising to 4.3% in August — the highest since 2021.
The weak August report came on the heels of another soft reading in July, which prompted Trump to fire the Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)Erika McEntarfer. Her removal came hours after the agency released new data showing that job growth had been significantly overstated. The bureau revised its May and June figures downward by 258,000 jobs, marking an unusually large correction that drew sharp criticism from Trump.
WHITE HOUSE SLAMS 911K JOBS REVISION, THE LARGEST ON RECORD, DEMANDS FED RATE CUT
The latest BLS revisions now suggest earlier reports overstated employment by more than 900,000 jobs. The adjustment, the largest correction on record and at the higher end of Wall Street forecasts, comes as Trump intensifies pressure on theFederal Reserveto cut interest rates to prop up growth.

Brian Mulberry, senior client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management, told Fox News Digital as many as 100,000 jobs could be at risk if a shutdown occurs, with Washington-area workers hit hardest.
Still, he noted the broader economic effect may be muted:
""Would losing 100,000 federal workers move the unemployment rate higher? The answer is no,"" Mulberry said, estimating that it would add just 0.06 percentage points if private-sector hiring failed to offset the losses.

I was continuing onmy Walk Across Americawhen I stopped on a cracked sidewalk in Trenton,New Jersey, and stared up at a bridge that’s seen better days. Its steel spine carries a motto that still packs a punch: Trenton Makes, the World Takes.
Those words aren’t just a slogan. They’re a battle cry from a time when this city’s pulse was the bustle of factories, the hum of machines and the sweat of men and women who built something real— something that mattered. From here, steel, rubber and ceramic material flowed out, shaping the world beyond the river. That was Trenton’s pride, its soul.
Walk these streets now, and you feel the weight of what’s been lost. The factories are gone — hollow ghosts, like the dreams of the people left behind. Where industry once stood, poverty now sits. Wherejobs gave life, drugs and gunfire, now write the story. Boarded-up houses stare back like empty eyes. The bridge still proclaims its motto, but it feels like a cruel reminder of a city that used to be.
WITHOUT GOD, NEW YORK'S DREAM TURNS HOLLOW. MY WALK ACROSS AMERICA PROVES IT
I know this story. I live it on theSouth Side of Chicago. Same script, different stage. Industry packed up, left town and took hope with it. Families splintered. Streets turned mean. Kids who should be dreaming of college are dodging bullets instead. Trenton, Chicago—pick your city. Too many carry this scar.
But I’m not here to mourn what’s gone. I’m here to fight for what’s possible. Standing in Trenton’s shadow, I see more than ruin. I see a spark that refuses to die. This city, like so many others, isn’t just a graveyard of theAmerican Dream— it’s a battlefield for its revival.
CHICAGO'S 'ROOFTOP PASTOR' TO EMBARK ON EPIC CROSS-COUNTRY JOURNEY TO BENEFIT AMERICA'S TROUBLED YOUTH
Think about it: If America could forge steel to build bridges, why can’t we forge opportunity to build lives? If we could raise factories to churn out goods, why not raise up centers where kids learn to thrive in the modern world, where hope gets a second chance? We didn’t just make things in this country — we made futures. We can do it again.
This isn’t just about Trenton. It’s about every corner of America where despair has settled in like dust.
This isn’t just about Trenton. It’s about every corner of America where despair has settled in like dust. It’s about the kids who’ve never seen a clear path to something better, only the haze of violence and want.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced on Sept. 29 agovernment-led initiative to boost coaluse and production in the U.S. As he told Fox News anchor Maria Bartiromo in an interview: this will not sit well with the Chardonnay set.
As electricity prices soar across the U.S., thanks in part to dogged efforts by blue-state officials to dump fossil fuels, those climate-obsessed voices will be drowned out by those of struggling consumers.
Over the two decades from January 1985 through January 2005,electricity prices in the U.S.climbed by only 19%; in the following 20 years until January of this year, electricity prices exploded by more than 90%. Just this year, the price per kilowatt-hour has jumped another 6%.
TRUMP'S UN SPEECH REVEALS INCONVENIENT TRUTH OF MASSIVE GREEN ENERGY COSTS
In California, the trends are even worse as Golden State residents pay almost double the average charge in the U.S. People living in New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts are similarly paying much higher prices than the national average. Why the disparity? Because Democrat-run states have purposefully shifted to high-cost and unreliable renewable energy.

In New York, as governor, Andrew Cuomo banned fracking and banned new pipelines from bringing much-needed and cheaper natural gas into his state. New Jersey and other blue states promoted similar measures, while embracing renewables like offshore wind and solar that are intermittent and therefore need backup, usually provided by natural gas. This is not efficient, and it is costly.
Unlike the Biden administration, theTrump White House understandsthat the demand for energy over the next few years, thanks in particular to AI and other new technologies, will expand at a pace that will truly demand an ""all of the above"" approach. That means not just increased oil and natural gas production, investments in solar and other renewables, but alsomore reliance on nuclear powerand — yes — on coal.
TRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS
PresidentBarack Obama,Biden and other climate warriors have, for years, waged war against coal, which today accounts for 15% of electricity production, down from half as recently as 2000. In 2016, then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton proudly claimed her cleanenergypolicies would ""put a lot ofcoal minersand coal companies out of business,"" a boneheaded remark that showed how out of touch the former first lady was with the needs of working-class Americans. At the time, there were some 70,000 coal miners in the U.S.; today, that has shrunk to 40,000.
PresidentDonald Trumprecognizes that one of the greatest assets of the United States, enhancing our ability to compete in next-generation technology, is our abundant cheap energy, and especially coal. The government’s Energy Information Administration wrote last year, ""In the United States, coal resources are larger than remaining natural gas and oil resources."" In addition, it reported that, ""As of Jan. 1, 2024, the demonstrated reserve base (DRB) was estimated to contain 469 billion short tons of coal.""
The 2024 production was just above 500 million short tons, or less than half of the amount produced in 2008. Roughly speaking, we could double current coal output and produce at that level for hundreds of years. That is not an asset any government should ignore.
The Chinese certainly would not let such a reserve go to waste. While the U.S. and Europe sacrifice using cheap coal in favor of higher-cost renewables in their quest to cut carbon emissions, theChinese are building coal-fired power plantsas rapidly as they can, the environmental consequences be damned.
TRUMP ADMIN PUTS $625M TOWARD KEEPING COAL PLANTS OPEN, LOWER ENERGY COSTS
While China is opening coal plants, the U.S. has been shutting ours down. The White House will change that. The government is planning tospend $625 million,including $350 million to modernize coal plants, $175 million for coal projects that will target rural communities and some $100 million to make existing plants cleaner and more efficient. Overall, the objective is to keep more plants running, including dozens that were slated to close.
This is not the first move made by the Trump White House to expand coal’s role in our energy system. In spring, the president signed an executive order instructing the head of the National Energy Dominance Council to designate coal as a ""mineral""; the purpose was to ""streamline permitting,"" which would allow more leasing and ultimately more production overall, and, specifically, on federal lands. The president also demanded that agencies reduce ""barriers"" to coal mining and ""rescind any agency policies that seek to transition the nation away from coal production.""

Wright told Bartiromo that,""We’re going to export more of that coal, we’re going to use it for American industry, particularly as we reindustrialize, and it’s going to continue to provide 15%-16% of our electricity and enable us to reindustrialize and win the AI race.""

The Trump administration is not just focused on coal. It is also pushing for higher oil and natural gas production, reversing Biden’s slow-walking of drilling permits and leasing. Oil production is up about 3% this year, but that is just the beginning.
TRUMP ADMIN TACKLES URGENT ELECTRICAL GRID CRISIS AS AI SET TO DOUBLE DEMAND
In August, the Department of the Interior proposed a new oil and gas offshore leasing plan that includes 30 auctions in the Gulf of America through 2040 and six auctions in Alaska’s Cook Inlet through 2032. That’s a far cry from the Biden administration’s plan, which scheduled a total of only three oil and gas lease sales — the minimum required by the Inflation Reduction Act. Biden leased fewer federal acres for oil and gas than any president since World War II.
While China is opening coal plants, the U.S. has been shutting ours down. The White House will change that.

Nuclear, too, is getting a boost from the Trump White House. In May, Trump initiated a ""nuclear energy renaissance,"" directing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to streamline the approval process for new reactors, including setting a new 18-month deadline for licensing decisions. The goal? Increase U.S. nuclear energy capacity from around 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts by 2050.
This ""all of the above"" energy renewal program — exploiting this country’s vast energy resources — may well become President Trump’s greatest legacy. We need energy to compete … and to make America great again.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-h-1b-visa-reform-plan-needs-put-americans-first,Trump’s H-1B visa reform plan needs to put Americans first,"NSI Deputy Executive Director Martha Miller joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the State Department’s warning to foreigners not to glorify the assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk.
PresidentDonald Trump’s executive order just put a$100,000 fee on new petitionsfor H-1B temporary workers. The rollout suffered from muddled communication, and the order does not stop the H-1B from being used to replace American workers — but it’s a sorely needed first step.
Created more than 30 years ago to fill a temporary labor shortage, the H-1B has ballooned beyond its intended scope. It needs to be reformed to put American workers first.
Explaining how the H-1B went so far off the rails would take a whole report — which is why I’ve written one, coming out soon. Meanwhile, here are some of the problems.
TRUMP’S $100K H-1B VISA OVERHAUL COULD HIT TECH GIANTS LIKE AMAZON AND MICROSOFT HARDEST
H-1Bs allow companies to replace American workers with cheap foreign labor and suppress wages for Americans. Exceptions to the original H-1B annual cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year have expanded the number far beyond statutory limits.

First, 20,000 more were set aside for applicants with a master's degree or higher degree. Then, H-1Bs for universities and government research organizations were made cap-exempt. Then DHS allowed the spouses of H-1B holders to work.
Fraud, nepotism and corruption have long compromised the H-1B process. Outsourcing firms and ""body shops"" rig the labor market to hire foreign workers over Americans.
FOREIGN TRAVELERS SOON TO PAY 'VISA INTEGRITY FEE' TO VISIT THE U.S. COSTING $250
Yet there is no shortage of domestic science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) graduates. Every year, the U.S. produces more graduates with bachelor's degrees in computer science and engineering than the economy demands, and overall, only 28% of workers with a STEM degree actually work in a STEM job.
There are some high-talent H-1Bs, but as Howard University Political Science Professor Ron Hira says, the typical H-1B recipients ""are ordinary skilled workers"" who could be supplied domestically.
Amazon, Intel, Google, Microsoft and many other companies have let American workers go while they continued to hire thousands of H-1Bs. Companies predictably deny any connection between the two phenomena, but laid-off U.S. workers insist otherwise. In 2020, the site White Collar Workers of America ranked the ""Misfortune 500"" body shops most-abusive of H-1Bs. In some cases, companies even require Americans they are sacking to train their foreign replacements.
On Sept. 25, Iowa Republican Sen.Chuck Grassleyand Illinois Democrat Sen. Dick Durbin wrote to the CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft and other large American companies asking for specific information about their hiring of H-1Bs, saying ""we find it hard to believe that [you] cannot find qualified American tech workers to fill these positions.""
DOJ CALLS FOR TIPS ON EMPLOYERS FAVORING FOREIGN WORKERS IN HIRING PRACTICES
H-1Bs were supposed to be limited to three years, but holders can renew up to six years. And if an alien can’t get a green card because of the cap (no one country is allowed more than 7% of the annual visas), he can get three-year extensions indefinitely.
Many of the top employers of H-1B workers are foreign-based outsourcers who hire thousands of low-wage H-1Bs and farm them out to U.S. industry. More than 70% of new H-1B workers are from India, with China a distant second at 11%.
H-1Bs allow companies to replace American workers with cheap foreign labor and suppress wages for Americans. Exceptions to the original H-1B annual cap of 65,000 visas each fiscal year have expanded the number far beyond statutory limits.
By going through an outsourcing firm, U.S. companies can pay less and avoid negative publicity when replacing Americans. In 2024, hundreds of subcontractors filed for H-1Bs on behalf of Verizon, Wells Fargo, and Walmart. From 2020 to 2024, Citigroup hired more than 3,000 new H-1B workers via outsourcers, who paid them less than those Citi hired directly.
Many H-1B subcontractors commit unscrupulous or illegal practices. In 2024, Kishore Dattapuram and Kumar Aswapathi, owners of Nanosemantics in San Jose, California, pled guilty in an H-1B visa case. According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, ""In pleading guilty, Dattapuram admitted to working with Aswapathi and Giri to submit fraudulent H-1B applications that falsely represented that foreign workers had specific jobs waiting for them at designated end-client companies when, in fact, the jobs did not exist.""

Outsourcing giant Cognizant has successfully petitioned for over 52,000 new H-1B workers since 2009, the highest of any company. In 2024, Cognizant was found liable for intentionally discriminating against more than 2,000 non-Indian employees between 2013 and 2022.
American workers at Cognizant were twice as likely to be fired or resign than workers on visas, and, ""Black employees were let go at a rate 23 times that of Asian workers."" According to Bloomberg, ""each of the five largest outsourcing companies has either settled, lost or is currently fighting a discrimination lawsuit"" within the last four years."" Yet they are allowed to continue petitioning for new workers.
TheH-1B salary minimumwas set at $60,000 in the 1990s but has not been adjusted for inflation. Employers must attest that they will pay new H-1Bs at least the prevailing wage, but a July 2025 Heritage Foundation report showed most H-1B positions pay below-average salaries.
Microsoft reportedly pays 82% of its foreign workers less than the market wage. Accounting giant Deloitte paid H-1B workers 10% less than Americans in similar roles. Many universities use their cap-exempt status to recruit foreign workers over their own graduates.

The most corrupt element in the H-1B pipeline is when they convert to permanent residence. This ""PERM process,"" according to a 2020 Department of Labor report, ""relentlessly has employers not complying with the qualifying criteria"" — because it is a hoop which they must reluctantly jump through before they can hire their preferred, foreign candidate into a job.
The law requires PERMjobsto be advertised, but companies try to hide them. They try to minimally advertise open positions while avoiding qualified American applicants.
H-1Bs were supposed to be limited to three years, but holders can renew up to six years. And if an alien can’t get a green card because of the cap (no one country is allowed more than 7% of the annual visas), he can get three-year extensions indefinitely.
In 2021,Facebook (Meta) was fined $4.75 millionfor intentionally denying qualified U.S. workers a fair opportunity to apply for jobs that it had reserved for H-1Bs. In 2023, Apple paid $25 million for similar discrimination. But these fines are minuscule compared with the profits from bringing in cheap labor.
In 2025, a group of veteran tech workers set up the site www.jobs.now. They find deliberately obscure job advertisements and post them, advising applicants to file complaints with the Department of Justice if they believe they were unfairly rejected.

At a time when 6.1% of recent college graduates with computer science majors are unemployed, allowing thousands of foreign workers to compete against them on unfair terms makes no sense.
Charging new H-1B petitioners $100,000 will be a body blow to body shops. But it will leave open many other side doors to unfair competition. Let’s hope this is the beginning of more reform to put the H-1B back in its box and give Americans first crack at their own labor market.

For most of American history, having children was considered part of the dream: a family, a house, and the hope of building something better for the next generation. But askGeneration Z, and you’ll hear a different story.
At the dinner table the other evening, all three of my children in their 20s talked about the possibility of not having kids and why. It broke my heart. But, more young adults are saying, ""I don’t want kids."" And their reasons tell us something very important about where America is headed and the real financial realities of today’s world.
It’s the Money, Plain and Simple
Raising kids has becomebrutally expensivein this country. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates it now costs over $300,000 to raise a child to age 18 – not countingcollege, which can easily tack on another six figures.
More young adults are saying, ""I don’t want kids."" And their reasons tell us something very important about where America is headed.(Wodicka/ullstein bild via Getty Images)
At the same time, themedian home pricehas climbed above $411,000, making the dream of homeownership – a traditional foundation for starting a family – out of reach for many.
AMERICA'S OBSESSION WITH POLITICIZING OUR CHILDREN HAS GOT TO STOP
Layer on student loan debt averaging $37,000 per borrower, rising child care costs, and a shaky job market filled with gig and contract work, and it’s no surprise that Gen Z feels priced out of parenthood.
A Generation Redefining Happiness
For past generations, family and climbing the corporate ladder was the ultimate marker of success. Gen Z is rewriting the rules. Many value personal freedom, career growth and travel over traditional milestones like marriage and children. Happiness doesn’t have to mean a spouse and two kids in the suburbs anymore – it can mean financial independence,meaningful workor even online communities.
And then there’s mental health. This generation reports the highest levels ofanxiety and depressionof any living age group. For some, the idea of managing their own mental well-being is enough of a challenge, let alone taking on the responsibility of raising children.
Gen Z is also the first generation to grow up with climate change drilled into their heads from childhood. Polls show nearly 40% cite environmental concerns as a reason to delay or avoid having children altogether. Add in constant headlines about inflation, wars and pandemics, and many feel like the future is too unstable to responsibly bring a child into the world.

The Gender Equation
For women, the calculation is even sharper. Despite decades of progress, women still shoulder most child care responsibilities. Many in Gen Z simply don’t see motherhood as compatible with their career ambitions or the lifestyle they want. With more opportunities than ever before for women in corporate American and entrepreneurial ventures, some women are unwilling to pay the price – in time, money and freedom – that comes with raising a child.
The Bigger Problem for America
Here’s the issue: America needs babies. In 1960, the average woman had 3.6 children. Today, it’s just 1.6 – well below the replacement rate needed to sustain a healthy population. If these trends continue, we’ll face shrinking tax bases, fewer workers to support Social Security and an aging population that strains the system.
This isn’t just a lifestyle choice by Gen Z – it’s a looming demographic crisis for the country.  And a looming problem for Gen X parents hoping their kids will give them a bunch of grandchildren.

As a financial advisor, I understand the hesitation. As a parent, it’s tough to swallow. Raising a family has never been more expensive or more uncertain. But if we want to preserve America’s vitality, we mustmake family life more affordableand attractive again – through lower housing costs, tackling inflation on day-to-day items and addressing the staggering price of child care in this country.
If Generation Zopts out of parenthood, the personal choice of millions could shape the destiny of our nation. The question is no longer why they don’t want kids – it’s whether America can afford a future without them.

Like most Trump appointees,Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldinhas been called a lot of things since taking the job, but ""champion of the Black community"" is probably not one of them. However, he is earning that title now that his agency is taking on costlyBiden-era car regulationsthat would have disproportionately hurt those most in need of affordable transportation.
Specifically, theEPAhas proposed therepeal of new tailpipe standardsthat would have tacked on an agency-estimated $2,100 to the already-rising sticker prices for new gasoline-powered vehicles. The rule was a major part of the previous administration’s aggressive agenda to force a transition away from gasoline toelectric vehicles (EVs).The agency is also reconsidering the underlying 2009 Obama administration finding that opened the door to this new crackdown on tailpipe emissions by allowing climate change considerations to play a role.
The environmental benefits are highly questionable — even proponents shy away from saying that compliant vehicles would have a measurable impact in reducing future temperatures — but the costs are real and hurt some much more than others.
TRUMP ADMIN SCORES LEGAL WIN IN $16B CLIMATE FIGHT AS FEDERAL APPEALS COURT LIFTS BLOCK ON GRANT TERMINATIONS
Affordable personal transportation is absolutely essential for those still climbing the economic ladder. Putting aside the near worship by some of public transit, the reality is that buses and trains can only take you to a subset of the job choices available if you can drive door to door. This is especially true of those who live in relatively poor neighborhoods far from the most promising employers in town. A vehicle also opens up opportunities in the gig economy. Not surprisingly, studies identify vehicle ownership as an important factor in reducing the racial wage gap.

But these gains are threatened by rising new car prices, which would only worsen as these Biden-era regulations continue to get more stringent in the years ahead. And used car prices generally rise in tandem with new ones.
Beyond making vehicles prohibitively expensive for some, higher prices also create financing challenges for others, including reliance on high-interest sub-prime loans. Not surprisingly, vehicle loan delinquency rates are at a 30-year high.
TRUMP ADMIN EYES OVERTURNING BIDEN'S GREEN ENERGY LEGACY TO TUNE OF $7B
Nor are EVs a viable option for those not yet in the middle class. Their average price, around $57,000 according to Kelley Blue Book, is around $8,000 more than a gasoline vehicle and exceeds the annual incomes of more than half of Black households. In addition, EV charging is particularly inconvenient for urban apartment dwellers.  And, realistically, an EV is not practical as a family’s one all-purpose vehicle — which is all most lower-income households can afford.

As expected, the proposed repeal is getting plenty of harsh criticism from the multi-billion-dollar environmental activist community, including more than a fewenvironmental justice activistswho could hardly be any more out of touch when it comes to affordable transportation and the real needs of low-income and minority communities.
To be sure, Zeldin need not bother clearing any mantel space for an NAACP or Urban League award. But his efforts to make cars more affordable, if successful, will accomplish more for the Black community than most of the actual winners.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-un-speech-reveals-inconvenient-truth-massive-green-energy-costs,Trump's UN speech reveals inconvenient truth of massive green energy costs,"EPA administrator Lee Zeldin joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss President Donald Trump's remarks on climate change, Hillary Clinton's dismissal of his claims and more.
At the Sept. 23, 2025, U.N. General Assembly, PresidentDonald Trumpdrew global headlines by blasting what he called the ""extreme cost"" of thegreen transition,arguing that climate alarmism is impoverishing ordinary people while enriching elites. Whatever one thinks of Trump’s rhetoric, he touched on an inconvenient truth: despite endless assurances from campaigners and institutions like the U.N., World Bank, and World Economic Forum,wind and solarare still not delivering cheap energy. In fact, they are making electricity more expensive.
For years, media and green advocates have insisted that solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity. This claim is central to the idea that a green transition is inevitable and beneficial — even under a second Trump administration. But two decades of evidence shows the opposite. The countries that have added the most solar and wind also have the highest power costs.
The claim of ""cheap"" solar and wind is built on a sleight of hand. These sources are indeed often competitive when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. But modern societies need power 24/7. When the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing, countries must rely on costly backup — mostly fossil fuels. Factoring in these costs reveals that renewables are far from cheap.
WORLD LEADERS LAUGH, SQUIRM AS TRUMP BLASTS UN ON CLIMATE, UKRAINE, GAZA AT GENERAL ASSEMBLY
A study of China found solar’s real cost was twice that of coal. Research about Germany and Texas showed that once backup costs are included, solar and wind go from appearing slightly cheaper to many times more expensive.

We see this in consumer prices. Germany, Spain, Denmark and the U.K. have some of the world’s highest electricity costs alongside massive investments in renewables. Last year, households and industries in the EU paid more than 26 cents per kilowatt-hour, more than double the U.S. price of 13 cents and triple the price in China. The U.K., with its even greener ambition, paid an eye-watering 36 cents per kilowatt-hour, nearly three times the U.S. price and more than four times the price in China.
Across 70 countries, International Energy Agency data shows a clear pattern: more renewables, higher costs. Every 10% increase in the share of wind and solar raises average power costs by over four cents per kilowatt-hour.
Headlines often tout how Germany and other nations and states generate most of their electricity from renewables. But these stories never mention the dark, windless days when solar and wind provide almost nothing. Last winter, renewables repeatedly delivered less than 4% of Germany’s power for an entire day.
TRUMP'S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS
Advocates say batteries will fix this problem. But all of Germany’s storage would last less than 20 minutes. The reality:fossil fuelsremain essential, but because they now run less frequently, costs soar. Last November, when solar and wind provided almost nothing, wholesale German prices spiked to $1 per kilowatt-hour
As conventional plants shut down, the risks rise. A German utility CEO warned the country narrowly avoided blackouts only because the weather wasn’t colder.
If solar and wind were truly cheaper, poor countries would leapfrog to them. Yet the opposite is happening. Across developing nations, electricity demand rose almost 5% last year — mostly met by fossil fuels. China used more additional coal than it used additional solar and wind combined. Bangladesh used 13 times more additional coal than additional renewables.
'WEB OF DARK MONEY' TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN
India, praised for ambitious solar goals, still added three times more coal than solar and wind. Billionaire Gautam Adani, struggling to find buyers for a $6 billion solar project, allegedly resorted to a $265 million bribery scheme — because most Indian states refuse to rely on unreliable renewables.
Poor nations know reliability matters. Rich nations can indulge the solar-and-wind illusion only because they already have fossil backups and lavish subsidies.

Europe’s high prices at least reflect the true costs of renewables. The U.S. disguises them through subsidies. Federal tax credits for wind and solar alone cost nearly $18 billion in 2024, with states adding billions more. In Texas alone, total subsidies may have reached nearly $20 billion in 2023 — 10 times the federal subsidies.

Across the U.S., hidden subsidies may exceed $60 billion annually, meaning real power costs are about 25% higher than official bills suggest.
GARGANTUAN ‘BIRD CEMETERIES’ IN BURGUM’S CROSSHAIRS AS DOI LOOKS TO CURB GREEN WIND PROJECTS
The myth of cheap renewables is comforting but destructive. It sustains a system of rising bills and endless subsidies, hitting the poorest hardest.
Advocates say batteries will fix this problem. But all of Germany’s storage would last less than 20 minutes.
Trump is right to call out the economic damage of today’s climate policies. But the solution is not to ignoreclimate change— it is to pursue smarter ones. We should focus on innovation that can genuinely make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels. This means dramatically more investment in research and development: from advanced nuclear to more reliable renewables with storage to geothermal breakthroughs.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Such investments would cost far less than today’s climate spending and deliver real benefits. Until then, fossil fuels will remain indispensable. Pretending otherwise onlymakes energy more costlyand less secure.
The world needs honesty: solar and wind are not yet cheap because they need backup, and forcing them onto power grids only raises prices. If rich countries concerned with climate change prioritize innovation over illusion, they could lead a real green revolution — one built not on slogans, but on affordable, reliable energy for all.

GOOGLE TURNS CO2 INTO BATTERY POWER FOR CLEAN ENERGY
The Paris Solar farm began producing power in December 2024 and generates 200 megawatts of renewable electricity during the day. That amount is enough to supply about 55,000 homes each year.
Wisconsin’s first large-scale solar battery park combines solar power with storage, providing reliable clean energy day and night.(We Energies)
Now, a 110-megawatt battery storage system has been added. These batteries capture excess energy from the solar panels and release it at night, during cloudy weather, or when demand suddenly rises. The battery system can power about 130,000 homes for up to four hours.
By combining solar generation with battery storage, Wisconsin is addressing one of renewable energy's most significant challenges: ensuring a steady and reliable power supply at all times.
NEW TESLA SOLAR-POWERED CHARGING STATION OPENS
Energy useis climbing, and nearly 79 percent of electricity in the United States still comes from fossil fuels. That dependence contributes to increased carbon pollution, higher costs and leaves the grid vulnerable during extreme conditions.
The Paris Solar-Battery Park reduces reliance on fossil fuels while strengthening Wisconsin's grid. It also provides a model other states can follow.
Mike Hooper, president of project partner We Energies, called the project ""historic"" and stressed that customers can count on dependable and affordable power in any weather. That level of reliability is especially crucial as storms, heatwaves and cold snaps put additional pressure on power systems.
Massive battery storage units at the Paris Solar-Battery Park capture solar energy for use during nights and peak demand.(We Energies)
Battery storage is becoming a cornerstone of the clean energy movement. Without storage, solar power only helps while the sun is shining. With it, renewable energy becomes flexible, consistent and available around the clock.
This shift benefits both the environment and consumers. Solar farms have been shown to cut electric bills by 5 to 20 percent. Additionally, the Paris Solar-Battery Park is eligible forfederal tax credits, which can pass on savings to residents.
Recent policy changes may reduce some of those incentives in the future. Even so, pairing solar with battery storage remains one of the most effective ways to lower costs and reduce emissions.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/china-weaponized-science-against-us-weve-figured-out-key-element-missed,China weaponized science against the US. We've figured out a key element they missed,"National security and military analyst Dr. Rebecca Grant discusses Russia, China and North Korea's alliance and President Donald Trump's crackdown on cartels.
In April,China imposed export restrictionson seven rare earth elements, crippling American manufacturing across dozens of critical sectors.Ford temporarily shuttered productionlines while European suppliers closed entire factories. In one calculated move, Beijing demonstrated its power to hobble the West.
This economic warfare represents decades of strategic planning. While America slept,Chinacornered the market on materials essential to modern civilization. By controlling 90% of rare-earth processing capacity, it dictates prices and decides who receives supplies. The periodic table became their ultimate economic weapon.
But weapons can be rendered obsolete through superior innovation. American scientists discovered that combining iron, the planet's fourth-most abundant element, with atmospheric nitrogen makes a compound more magnetic than anything produced by China. This breakthrough doesn't just match Chinese materials; it surpasses them.
US ‘ABSOLUTELY’ HAS ENOUGH RESOURCES TO BE RARE-EARTH INDEPENDENT AND DOMINANT, CLAIMS CEO
China's rare-earth monopoly began formingin the 1980s. Beijing flooded global markets with below-cost magnets. When Western companies surrendered market share, China tightened control, consolidating processing facilities and mining operations. By 2024, virtually every electric vehicle motor, wind turbine generator and advanced electronic device depended on materials Beijing could shut off at will.

The April export restrictions exposed this vulnerability with surgical precision. Ford's Chicago assembly plant felt the impact first. Explorer production was halted for seven days in May while executives scrambled to obtain export licenses from Chinese officials. European manufacturers suffered even worse disruptions.

Soon, the crisis had spread beyond cars. Aerospace manufacturers, semiconductor companies and defense contractors all discovered their dependence on materials that Beijing could weaponize without warning. This represented the culmination of China's three-decade strategy to corner critical mineral markets while American companies chased quarterly profits and policymakers prioritized cheap consumer goods over strategic independence.
CHINA'S RARE EARTH TECH OBSESSION ENSNARES US RESIDENT AS CCP LOOKS TO MAINTAIN STRANGLEHOLD
Yet, while China was tightening its grip,American researchersat the University of Minnesota had been solving a puzzle that had frustrated scientists since the 1950s. Professor Jian-Ping Wang spent nearly a decade perfecting techniques to synthesize iron nitride magnets from the most abundant elements on Earth. His breakthrough, published in 2010, finally explained how combining iron with nitrogen can create a material with magnetization exceeding anything China produces from rare earths.
The physics is remarkable. Iron nitride retains full magnetization at 200 degrees Celsius, exceeding the temperature capability of all magnet compounds except those made from the scarcest and most expensive critical elements. Most importantly, the raw materials come from sources no nation can monopolize: Minnesota's iron ore deposits and atmospheric nitrogen. Iron nitride represents something China cannot replicate — American innovation driven by scientific curiosity rather than stateindustrial policy —and reduces ournational securityand economic vulnerabilities while strengthening domestic manufacturing capacity.
Yet commercializing this breakthrough requires the same strategic commitment China demonstrated while building rare-earth dominance.Beijing spent hundreds of billions of dollarsover three decades, accepting losses to achieve market control. America needs comparable federal action to deploy iron nitridetechnologybefore China recognizes the threat and floods markets with below-cost rare earths to kill American innovation in its cradle.

The question is whether policymakers will act with the same strategic patience China demonstrated while building rare-earth dominance, or whether they will allow another generation of American industrial capacity to migrate overseas in pursuit of cheap imports that mask dangerous dependencies.
The periodic table need not remain China's weapon. American science has found the antidote. The only remaining question is whether America possesses the strategic will to deploy it.

We came to Washington with a similar mission: fight for Florida families, for freedom and for the kind of economic opportunity that lets every American chase their dream. PresidentDonald Trumpcame here for the same reason.
But a threat to this mission continues to exist in the IRS, a bloated, unaccountable agency that, underJoe Biden, turned into a weapon against working Americans.
That’s changing now.

President Trump made a smart move by puttingScott Bessentin charge at the IRS. He’s a businessman, not a bureaucrat. He knows how to get things done and understands what matters: getting results, protecting taxpayers and getting the IRS out of the business of harassing Americans. That’s a win for every American who’s ever tried to follow the rules and still ended up under audit.
TRUMP'S 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' AND ITS PERMANENT TAX CUT WILL CHANGE THE WORLD
Bessent has already started clearing out the Biden-era holdovers who turned the agency into a tool for their political agenda. That’s great news. But it’s only step one.
A recent report from the Treasury inspector general found that audits targeting taxpayers skyrocketed in 2024, and that the agency is on track to fulfill its obligations under Biden’s 2022 agency directive.
Here’s what we need next: end thejob-killing tax policiesthe Biden administration forced onto Florida families and small businesses that are still occurring today. The focus needs to be on reducing the size and increasing the efficiency of the IRS, improving transparency, protecting Americans' private information and strengthening customer service.
The first place to start is ending Revenue Ruling 2014-14, a nightmare policy that has created total confusion for Americans across the country. It forced business owners into a corner, making them choose between conflicting rules and risking IRS audits either way. That’s not how you grow jobs. That’s how you shut down small businesses.
TRUMP’S ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ COULD CEMENT ECONOMIC LEGACY FOR DECADES
And this isn’t just theory. We hear fromFloridians across the state, from businesses small and large, that Biden’s IRS made it harder to hire, invest and grow. Biden approved $70 billion for 87,000 new IRS agents to make sure they squeeze every penny possible out of American families. Because of that, Floridians don’t trust that their government has their back. They’re doing the right thing, and still, they’re looking over their shoulders, waiting for the IRS to come knocking.
That fear kills jobs. It limits opportunity. And it hits Florida harder than most, because we’re a state built on entrepreneurship, where anything is possible.
Secretary Bessent gets it. He’s pledged to bring the IRS back to basics: collect revenue, protect privacy andserve the taxpayer. No politics, no games, no harassment.

With Trump leading and Bessent executing, we finally have a shot to fix this broken agency. But we’ve got to finish the job.
That means scrapping Revenue Ruling 2014-14 and any Biden policy that punishes job creators. It means ending selective enforcement that targets conservatives and lets liberals off the hook.
These are quick actions the IRS can take to give families, retirees and business owners the certainty they need to build and grow.

In Florida, we don’t want handouts, we want freedom. The freedom to work hard, create jobs and live out the American Dream without the IRS breathing down our necks.
President Trump and Scott Bessent are delivering real results. Now Congress needs to back them up and make these reforms permanent. The IRS should work for the people, not against them.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-your-parents-could-afford-house-one-salary-you-cant-two,Why your parents could afford a house on one salary – but you can’t on two,"But what can the federal government do to bring home prices down?
Imagine yourparents or grandparentsbuying a house, raising a family, and living comfortably – all on a single paycheck. Today, even with two full-time incomes, many Americans barely scrape by. What happened?
The truth, as exposed in ""1971: How All of America’s Problems Can Be Traced to a Singular Date in History,"" is far more explosive than you’ve been told. This isn’t about inflation or changing lifestyles. It’s about a deliberate, top-down policy pivot that sabotaged the financial security of millions.
In August 1971, President Richard Nixon didn’t just make a routineeconomic decision– he pulled the rug out from under the middle class. By severing the dollar’s link to gold, the government unshackled itself from fiscal discipline, and Americans lost their last safeguard against runaway inflation. Overnight, your family’s savings became vulnerable, and the future was mortgaged for short-term political gain.
A single, calculated act in 1971 destroyed the financial foundation of the American middle class.(iStock)
Before this seismic shift, a single breadwinner’s salary was enough to buy a home and provide for a family. After 1971, the rules changed – and not by accident. Wages stagnated, the cost of living soared and the price of housing shot skyward. Families were forced into the ""two-income trap,"" where even double the pay couldn’t keep pace with the artificially inflated costs of essentials.
GOLD MIGHT GLITTER, BUT IT’S STILL MONEY. TAXES SHOULD TREAT IT THAT WAY
Today’s dual-income households are a symptom, not a solution. The system is set up so that, despite working harder and longer, American families are poorer than previous generations. The post-1971 era unleashed banks to flood the market with easy credit,driving home pricesto ludicrous heights while real incomes froze.
The result? The American dream was transformed into a cruel joke – a game rigged so only the wealthy win.

Politicians and pundits will tell you, ""That’s just progress."" But the numbers expose the betrayal. A median home cost just $23,000 – four times the average household income – in 1970. Now, that ratio has exploded, with homes costing eight times what most families earn. You’re not failing; you’re being failed by a system that was reengineered to profit the few at the expense of the many.
The uncomfortable truth: A single, calculated act in 1971 destroyed the financial foundation of the American middle class. And unless the rigged rules are confronted, thedream of homeownership– and a secure future – will remain a relic of your parents’ generation.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hitchhikers-guide-gambits-avoid-government-shutdown-next-few-days,The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the gambits to avoid a government shutdown over the next few days,"Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss Congress' plans after returning from August recess amid shutdown concerns.
Gaming out what might happen over the next couple of days on an effort to avert a government shutdown…
The newest wrinkle today is that Democrats intend to release their version of an interim spending bill soon. The question is when? One senior source said it may not come until Friday.
The Houseis now expected to vote on the GOP’s ""clean"" CR to simply renew all funding at the present levels through November 21 on Friday. First of all, the House must pass the bill. That could be tough because Democrats believe all of their members will vote no. It’s about the math: Republicans can only lose two votes on their side and still pass a bill without assistance from across the aisle. But let’s just operate under the presumption that the House can approve the bill Friday.
Then the measure goes to the Senate.
HOUSE PLANS THURSDAY VOTE ON GOVERNMENT FUNDING BILL TO EXTEND SPENDING THROUGH NOVEMBER

Getting to final approval of this bill would require two rounds of ""cloture"" to break a filibuster. By the book, this process could take days and certainly bleed into the weekend for the initial round.
However, Senate Republicans want to attendCharlie Kirk’sfuneral on Sunday. And both sides are anxious to blame the other for blowing up an interim spending bill.

So, staring into the crystal ball – and speaking with senior sources from both sides – the following could happen in the Senate:
The Senate gets the interim spending bill from the House on Friday afternoon. Both sides waive all of the rules and clocks in order to have two ""show"" votes sometime on Friday or Friday night.
Republicans will insist on having a vote to break a filibuster on the motion to proceed to the House-passed bill. That needs 60 yeas. There are 53 Senate Republicans. Fox is told thatSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is expected to be a no on the procedural vote.
That means eight Democrats would have to join Republicans to vote to break the filibuster to hit the 60-vote threshold. That is not going to happen.

The Senate would then vote in similar fashion on starting debate on the Democrats’ still-unwritten plan. The Senate would subject that vote to a 60 threshold. That too will fall short, since there are only 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats.
That produces an impasse.
""It’s good to have a logjam this early in the process,"" said one seniorSenate Democratto Fox. ""It shows that nothing can pass yet.""
That gambit allows both sides to make their points and get the other side on the record.

Such a scenario would prevent a weekend session in the Senate. Both the House and Senate are scheduled to be out of session next week. Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown Monday. However, the House and Senate could come back to session after Rosh Hashanah (Wednesday at nightfall) if necessary. The House and Senate have until 11:59:59 p.m. ET on September 30 to both pass a Band-Aid bill and send it to the President to avoid a shutdown.

https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/charlie-kirk-delivered-message-about-lifes-ups-downs-restaurant-leaders-hours-before-shooting-death,Charlie Kirk delivered message about life's ups and downs to restaurant leaders hours before shooting death,"'The Charlie Kirk Show' executive producer Andrew Kolvet joins ‘Sunday Morning Futures’ to discuss the global response to political activist Charlie Kirk’s assassination and his legacy.
Just hours before he was fatally shot on a college campus in Utah, Turning Point USA founderCharlie Kirkdelivered a message to hundreds of restaurant leaders gathered in Salt Lake City last week.
Wade Allen, president of Costa Vida, a fast-casual Mexicanrestaurant chainthat started in Utah, was in the room when Kirk spoke at the annual Restaurantology summit, hosted by the Savory Fund, he told Fox News Digital.
He recalls Kirk's words not as political, but as deeply personal.

""There was nothing political about the conversation [with Savory Fund co-founder and managing director Andrew K. Smith],"" Allen said.
""In fact, the totality of the conversation was about entrepreneurship – the risks that you take being an entrepreneur and the hard work it takes and the dedication and the commitment.""

Kirk, known nationally for his political activism, may have surprised those in the audience by instead focusing onthe entrepreneurial journey.
Drawing from his own experiences, Kirk underscored the highs and lows that define life in both politics and business, Allen said.

""But the undercurrent of that whole message for me, and what I took away in a very big way — which I think most of the other audience took away — was that entrepreneurship is a journey, and there are good days and there are bad days,"" Allen said.
""But he quoted something specifically that, in time, this too will pass. And, so, when you're having those bad days, remember that this will pass, and then when you're having really good days and great days and great times, remember that, too, the time will pass as well.""

Allen described the message as ""very powerful"" when it was delivered – and then ""surreal"" as the news ofKirk's shootingbegan to spread after the conference broke for lunch.
""To say that Charlie was shot, I'm like, 'It's impossible. He just left here,'"" Allen recalled. ""And then I recognized, 'Wait a second, he left here before we got on stage, which would have been an hour and 15 minutes ago.' And then it all started to come out.""
The mood among attendees turned quickly as Smith returned to the stage to announce the news.

Then it got ""as quiet as a church,"" Allen said.
""I do know that a lot of people were just, kind of, almost in disbelief and the remainder of that event was really somber.""

""The restaurant industry, in general, is full of a lot of entrepreneurs,"" Allen said — so Kirk's message that it takes hard work and ""you have to listen and engage with people"" rang familiar.
""His message resonated so well,"" Allen said.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americans-ready-reality-socialism,Are Americans ready for the reality of socialism?,"‘The Faulkner Focus’ panelists Julian Epstein and Jeremy Hunt discusses a new Gallup poll on the popularity of socialism and capitalism in America.
The recent New York primary win by Democrat Zohran Mamdani, a self-proclaimed socialist, raises the question that has been simmering for years: Is America ready for socialism?
Our nationwide survey of 2,067 college and university students across the U.S. suggests the answer starts with another question: What constitutes socialism? Only 34% of students define socialism as state ownership and central planning, the classic definition. Almost half instead define it as active government and redistribution, and many admit they are unsure. This confusion shapes how people talk about socialism and why it polls well with young voters.
Politicians have helped blur the lines by pointing to places such as Nordic countries like Sweden as models of""democratic socialism,""claiming they are successful models of what it could look like in the U.S. But Sweden is not a socialist economy. The policies endorsed by Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, New York Democrat Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,Mamdani and others — like implementing awealth tax,increasing inheritance taxes, corporate taxes and income taxes to pay for a large welfare state — are not the policies of Sweden. It is a market-based system with high taxes that fund a generous welfare state.
US SUPPORT FOR CAPITALISM SINKS TO NEW LOW IN GALLUP POLL
While the tax burden for individuals is relatively high in Sweden, the Swedish government notes that itswelfare systemis built on the principle that everyone pays, not just the rich. The top marginal income tax rate is higher in Sweden than in the U.S. But these higher taxes aren’t just being paid by the rich in Sweden. The top rate applies to everyone earning barely above the national average in Sweden, compared to the U.S. where the highest rate is paid by those earning 800% higher than the national average.

Moreover,Swedenimposes a 25% consumption tax on goods and services, versus state and local sales taxes in the U.S. that average 7.7%. Sweden also has no wealth tax, no inheritance tax and a lower corporate tax rate than in the U.S.
Sweden learned the hard way what happens when it moved toward the kind of policies advocated for by""democratic socialists.""As highlighted by Johan Norberg and others, for almost 100 years, the country had a small government and an open economy until the country experimented withsocialismin the ’70s and ’80s. During that time, they expanded the size of government, increased income taxes, introduced a wealth tax and an inheritance tax. Iconic companies like IKEA left the country, growth stalled and the country experienced a financial crisis that forced major reforms in the early 1990s. Today, Sweden is one of the most economically free countries in the world.
FETTERMAN RIPS ‘LEFTIES’ IN DEM PARTY, SAYING PEOPLE IN EX-COMMUNIST NATION TOLD HIM ‘YOU ARE MORONS'
So, what do young Americans want? When we asked students whether they are in favor of universal healthcare and free higher education, 78% said yes if it is funded by a wealth tax on the top 1%. Seventy-one percent said yes if funded by higher incometaxeson the top 10%. When asked whether they were in favor of these things if funded by a universal consumption tax, support dropped to half. When funded by a higher income tax on most people, only 38% were in favor. Clearly, college students (and presumably other Americans who are in favor of these things) are much more in favor of a larger welfare state if somebody else foots the bill.

History and economics show that the systems built on ever-expanding government eventually hit a wall. As the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously said, ""The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people’s money.""
Before America decides it is ready for socialism, it’s clear we need to get educated on what it actually means and what it really costs. Only then can we truly debate whether socialism is ""a commitment to dignity,"" as Mamdani says, or whether it is a prescription for ruin.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/5-things-explain-hyundai-immigration-debacle,5 things that explain the Hyundai immigration debacle,"Former Dallas Fed advisor Danielle DiMartino Booth discusses the I.C.E. raid at a Hyundai plant and the heated exchange between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and FHFA Director Bill Pulte on 'The Will Cain Show.'
When ICE visited a new battery plant run by theKorean firm Hyundailast week, they went to find several aliens working there illegally – from Latin America. They were probably not expecting to roll up hundreds of illegal South Korean workers at the same time.
This came as a surprise to the national media and even some immigration experts. But the problems underlying ICE’s haul ofillegal Korean laborare no secret.
First, the B visitor’s visa. The B-1 is for business trips, the B-2 is for personal reasons like tourism or visiting relatives. There are so many different things an alien can do on a B that they are normally issued as one B1/B2 visa to keep it simple.
Federal agents detain workers during an immigration raid at the Hyundai battery plant construction site in Ellabell, Georgia.(ATF)
The B visa only allows a foreigner to apply for entry to the U.S. at an air or land port. There, Customs and Border Protection lets them in for a certain period. Most often, that is six months.
TRUMP COULD SECURE HIS PLACE IN AMERICAN HISTORY WITH THIS BOLD IMMIGRATION REFORM STRATEGY
Although an alien can’t work full-time on a B visa for an extended period, they are permitted to have meetings, repair or install complex, proprietary machinery, and carry out specialist training forAmerican workers. So, some of the Koreans could have applied for B visas and have come to Georgia to work on machinery or train Americans to do it. So far, so legal.
But Koreans are also allowed to enter the U.S. under the Visa Waiver Program (VWP) for up to 90 days for business or pleasure. Under the VWP, they are expressly not allowed to work. Still, visitors from many countries have abused the VWP, for example Israeli youth coming on VWP and selling Dead Sea salts in shopping malls for the summer, or Chileans coming to commit organized burglary.
It seems that some of the Koreans came under the VWP and were working illegally. Most probably, they were working for subcontractors that Hyundai hired for labor. Hyundai may have done so in good faith, assuming that the subcontractors were doing due diligence. But using subcontractors to avoid scrutiny and bring in cheap labor is a common tactic among big and small American and foreign companies.
FLORIDA TRAGEDY SHOWS WHY TRUMP’S TRUCKING LICENSE CRACKDOWN IS NEEDED
Then there is the H-1B. Despite their statutory purpose, and several attempts to fix loopholes, H-1Bs have been abused to replace American workers and as a source of cheap labor for a generation. U.S. companies from Alphabet to Walmart employ hundreds of thousands ofH-1B foreign workers, sometimes directly but often through outsourcing companies like Cognizant, HCL or Tata Consultancy Services. Most of the big ones are based in India or owned by Indians, and India is the source of nearly all their workers.
In addition to the H-1B, companies also misuse the L visa, which is for intra-company transfers. In theory, this should be for a foreign company, like Volvo or Toshiba, to bring in an executive for a few years to work in their U.S. branch then go home. However, the L has been abused by mom-and-pop motels and restaurants to bring in relatives, and as a back door when the H-1B annual numerical caps are reached.
ABOUT THOSE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN THE UNITED STATES
When I was issuing visas in India 25 years ago, large Indian out-sourcing/consultancy firms would hire young people out of college. After the minimum 12 months that they had to work for the company before being eligible for an L visa, they would send them to work for their U.S. subsidiary. They would farm them out as ""consultants"" to American companies, taking a fat cut.
Apart from thevisa fraud and abuse, the Hyundai debacle sheds light on one other question: if Hyundai wants to hire Americans, can they? In the skilled technical areas, yes – there are plenty of U.S. STEM graduates not working in that field, and unemployment for recent graduates is twice that of older workers. But factories need skilled blue-collar labor too. In Georgia, only half of eighth graders scored ""at or above basic"" and only a quarter ""at or above proficient"" in math.
As I write in my book, ""The Ten Woke Commandments (You Must Not Obey),"" U.S. K-12 education has gone from world-beating to self-defeating, thanks to a combination of bad teaching methods, low standards and individual failure.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Marxist educational ideology looks at every failing grade as evidence of systemic racism, rather than lack of application or poor teaching. Instead of doing what works – banning phones, keeping discipline, maintaining grade and test standards, and working longer and harder – they look to fads like ""culturally-responsive"" teaching, ""living mathematx"" (""a new form of mathematics where humans are no longer centered""), and ""Nepantla."" That, ""employed in a ‘mathematx’ context,"" means a kid can get the answer wrong and the teacher can grade it right.
Foreign investment in the U.S. can be a win/win, but only on fair terms. To avoid moreHyundaidebacles, we need two things.
First, we should not let American or foreign companies import cheap labor to compete with our own graduates and workers. Other than perhaps a few managers, technical specialists and native language speakers, companies like Hyundai can recruit most of their American workforce here in the U.S.

Second, U.S. states have to get serious about fixing theireducation systemsand train kids for the jobs of today and tomorrow.
No more excuses, nonsense and Nepantla – just the basics, and fast.

SUSTAINABLE 3D-PRINTED HOME BUILT PRIMARILY FROM SOIL
Contec's project isn't just a prototype. It demonstrates how 3D concrete printing can bring major benefits to everyday housing. Compared to traditional masonry construction, the Tapping home achieved:

And it doesn't cut corners on durability. The walls are fire-resistant, water-resistant, termite-proof and cyclone rated, features U.S. regions facing hurricanes, floods and wildfires could find especially appealing.
AMERICA'S LESSONS FROM WORLD’S LARGEST 3D-PRINTED SCHOOLS

Instead of stacking bricks, Contec's robotic printer extrudes a specialized concrete mix based on a digital 3D model. The mix sets in under three minutes, allowing new layers to be stacked without scaffolding or formwork.
The walls are printed in precise layers over the course of 18 hours of active machine time. Once the structural shell is complete, traditional crews step in to add the roof, wiring, windows, flooring and finishing touches.

Speed:Structural walls finished in 18 hours; full build completed in five months.Cost efficiency:22% cheaper than comparable masonry builds in WA.Design freedom:Complex shapes, curves and openings without added expense.Sustainability:30% lower CO₂ emissions than conventional concrete and minimal waste.Durability:More than three times stronger than brick, fire- and water-resistant and able to withstand harsh weather.

You may have already heard of Icon, the Texas-based startup that has been pioneering 3D printed homes. Icon's builds include entire neighborhoods of single-story housesin Austin, as well as experimental multi-level projects. However, most of Icon's multi-story designs rely on a hybrid approach, with 3D printing for the ground floor and timber or steel frames for the upper levels.
That's what makes the Tapping project stand out. Contec printed the structural walls for both stories in just 18 hours of active printing time, something not yet widely seen in the U.S. This could signal the next step for American 3D printing: scaling beyond single-story housing into more complex multi-story designs.
BRICKS MADE FROM RECYCLED COFFEE GROUNDS REDUCE EMISSIONS AND COSTS
Bedroom of a multi-story 3D concrete printed home located in Tapping, Australia.(Contec Australia)
One of the biggest questions people have is price. Contec hasn't shared the exact cost of the Tapping home, but the company says it delivered the structural walls 22% cheaper than a standard masonry build. That saving adds up when you consider how much of a home's budget goes toward labor and materials.
In the U.S., companies like Icon have priced 3D printed homes starting around $100,000 to $150,000, depending on size and finishes. While final costs vary by region, land and design, the potential savings from reduced labor and faster timelines make3D printingan attractive option as housing costs continue to rise.
VERTICAL TINY HOMES REDEFINE COMPACT LIVING

For American homeowners, builders and communities, the Tapping project shows how 3D concrete printing could offer faster, cheaper and more resilient housing. Imagine moving into a new home months earlier, with walls that are stronger, more sustainable and better able to handle extreme conditions.

3D printed housing is moving from concept to reality. This home shows that walls can go up in just 18 hours, and a full build can be finished in only a few months. That kind of speed changes the way we think about construction.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-rumored-housing-emergency-would-game-changer-key-gop-lawmaker-says,"Trump's rumored housing emergency would be a 'game-changer,' key GOP lawmaker says","HUD Secretary Scott Turner discusses President Donald Trump's plan to combat sky-high home prices on 'Fox & Friends.'
EXCLUSIVE:One of the House GOP's staunchest housing affordability advocates is calling PresidentDonald Trump'srumored emergency order on the issue a ""game-changer.""
House Main Street Caucus Chair Mike Flood, R-Neb., who also chairs the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee on the House Financial Services Committee, told Fox News Digital that he is hoping Trump ultimately follows through on declaring an emergency on housing affordability.
""When you have a housing shortage and a supply issue, it pushes up valuations, which pushes up your property taxes, because your valuation goes up. It pushes up home insurance premiums because the value of your home is more expensive if there was some kind of a claim,"" Flood explained.
""So the president of the United States putting his thumb on the scale and saying that housing is in a crisis situation, and it's an emergency – that changes the entire conversation.""

Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner told FOX Business on Tuesday that talks were ongoing on the issue but declined to make any firm declarations ahead of Trump.
""Those discussions are being had, not just from an emergency declaration standpoint, but what can we do in order to bring the costs down… and bring the supply up,"" Turner said.
Home priceshave skyrocketedin recent years, outpacing wage growth and making small houses that were once considered ""starters"" for young families out of reach for millions of Americans.
Zoning restrictions, high building costs, regulatory issues and insufficient levels of new construction have all been named as reasons for the current crisis.
Additionally, new tariffs on materials like steel, aluminum and lumber are projected to add about $10,900 to the cost of building a new single-family home, according to theNational Association of Home Builders.

""It's going to take the federal government, the state governments and the municipalities, most notably, to fix this,"" Flood said.
He added that his panel was also working on bipartisan legislation, expected in October or November, to make housingmore affordablenationwide.
""We have been working in our subcommittee and on Financial Services on our effort that will, I think, take a few steps forward, and hope to mark that up later this year in maybe October, November,"" Flood said. ""But the president coming in and making this a priority is what's going to push this at light speed across the finish line.""
He added: ""I truly think we can get something done by June of next year.""

Flood also stressed that housing affordability is a key election issue for Americans.
""Since 2020, we've seen 20% inflation, home insurance premiums are more expensive, mortgage rates are higher. You know, you've got all these rules in the federal programs that make it nearly impossible to be really effective with the assistance that HUD provides,"" Flood said.
""And with the president doubling down on an issue that I am very passionate about, I think that this is going to resonate with Americans, because this is what people are talking about.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dei-is-real-cause-of-americas-housing-crisis,DEI is the real cause of America’s housing crisis,"But what can the federal government do to bring home prices down?
Why doesn’t Hermes just produce more bags and then everyone can have a Birkin? That’s basically the argument of people pressing PresidentDonald Trumpto declare a housing emergency.
The fact is there’splenty of housing, just not in the most desirable neighborhoods. Population growth is slowing, deportations are increasing and new home construction already outpaces family creation. The shortage is a myth created by activists so they can force residential living patterns to conform to DEI dogma.
A simple calculation proves it. The Census Bureau collects annual data on both the number of households and the available housing stock. The latest data shows 131.3 million households and 146.5 million housing units, an excess supply of over 15 million units.
The housing shortage is a myth created by activists so they can force residential living patterns to conform to DEI dogma. (Jordan Vonderhaar/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
Activists cannot deny the excess so instead, they argue that it is not enough.
BLAME DRUGS AND MENTAL ILLNESS, NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR THE CHAOS GRIPPING OUR STREETS
A well-functioninghousing markethas a natural vacancy rate. Just as labor markets need unemployment for efficient job matching, housing markets need vacancies for buyer-seller alignment, renovations and seasonal use.
Activists say that rate should be 12% instead of the current 10%, and to hit that target an additional 1 million units are needed. But they are cherry-picking the baseline rate. Census data tracked since 1965 shows vacancy rates have fluctuated wildly, ranging from 8.3% to 14.5%. There is no stable ""natural rate."" Today’s 10% rate falls well within this historical range. When you stop using artificially high assumptions, the shortage disappears entirely.
Perhaps anticipating this, activists also argue that demand is higher than census data shows. First, they claim construction has fallen behind historical trends, from 1.5 million units annually in 1968-2000 to 1.23 million since 2001, creating a cumulative deficit. Second, they argue for massive pent-up demand, claiming millions of people would form separate households if housing were cheaper, using statistical models to estimate 3-5 million ""missing"" households.
HERE'S WHY HELPING THE HOMELESS REBUILD THEIR LIVES IS KEY TO AMERICA’S FUTURE SUCCESS
Both arguments assumedemographic conditionsthat no longer exist. America has transitioned from rapid population growth of over 1% annually before 2000 to a more stable 0.5% today, projected to reach 0.1% by 2055. The next 30 years will add 23 million people versus 70 million in the prior 30 years, reflecting lower birth rates and longer lifespans. Deaths will exceed births by 2038 as the population matures. Meanwhile, the current administration targets deporting one million people annually, a figure not included in Census projections that assumestable immigration.
Like Birkin bags, the real problem isn’t supply, it’s that people want exclusive neighborhoods, and no amount of construction changes that reality. What’s really going on here is that activists are manufacturing a housing crisis in order to impose a DEI regime on where people choose to live.
This is a corruption of the Fair Housing Act (FHA), which was focused on equality of opportunity not results. The bill did aim to disrupt segregated living patterns but only through the narrow mechanism of eliminating overt housing discrimination. In particular, restrictive covenants, redlining and explicit racial barriers.
TRUMP IS TRYING TO SAVE 100,000 AMERICAN LIVES WHILE DEMOCRATS LET CITIES SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL
As the legislative history records, the goal was to ensure families could live ""where they wishand where they can afford,"" acknowledging that financial capacity remained a valid constraint on housing choice.
Today’s activists have abandoned that sensible framework. Instead, they want to eliminate disparities in living patterns by lowering community standards through government coercion. Their chief target is local zoning laws, which serve the important function of maintaining community character. It’s why Washington, D.C., which bans skyscrapers, doesn’t look like Manhattan.
New York City’s Economic Development Corporation exemplifies this approach, scolding neighborhoods like the Upper East Side, SoHo and the West Village for ""restrictive land use regulations"" that limit density. They explicitly note that ""Community Districts producing the least affordable housing are disproportionately white."" Their demographic focus reveals the true agenda.

The Obama administration weaponized this logic through HUD’s Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule, forcing towns that accepted federal funding to eliminate zoning laws and to provide detailed reports on racial demographics. The effort had an important political dimension. By forcing high-density, low-income housing into suburban communities, activists aimed to flip red areas blue.
President Trump recognized the stakes in his first term, and tasked a White House team led by John McEntee to eliminate the rule, which they did in 14 days. Biden reinstated it, but HUD SecretaryScott Turnerwisely eliminated it again soon after taking office.
Unfortunately, some Republicans and Libertarians have fallen for the housing shortage hoax and still don’t realize that eliminating sensible neighborhood standards like zoning are a stalking horse for imposing DEI quotas. This is a problem because housing activists continue to push their radical agenda aggressively at the state level.

In 2021, Massachusetts passed a controversial law forcing the 177 towns along the commuter rail line to change their suburban zoning laws to permit high-density low-income housing. The bill was drafted to look optional and incentive-based, but officials are enforcing it as mandatory. Similar efforts are afoot nationwide, amplified by liberal columnists like Paul Krugman calling for ""increasing population density,"" meaning eliminating suburban single-family zoning.
Democrats have broughtDEI quotasto every institution in America. Your neighborhood is next. That’s the real housing crisis.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/us-support-capitalism-sinks-new-low-gallup-poll,US support for capitalism sinks to new low in Gallup poll,"A new Gallup poll shows only 54% have a positive opinion of capitalism while positivity surrounding socialism rises to 39%.
A Gallup poll published Tuesday found Americans' view of capitalism has fallen to its lowest level since the company began tracking the public's views on variouseconomic systemsin 2010.
According tothe poll, 54% of Americans held a positive view of capitalism in 2025, down from 60% in 2021. By contrast, favorability toward socialism has remained steady at 39%.
Despite capitalism's decline in support, it is still viewed more positively than socialism, with about 57% of Americans expressing a negative view of the latter.
FAITH IN AMERICAN DREAM DWINDLES AMID SOUR ECONOMIC SENTIMENTS, POLL FINDS
Favorable views among both Democrats and independents toward capitalism have dropped eight points since 2021. For the first time, fewer than half of Democrats (42%) viewed capitalism positively, while only a slim majority of independents (51%) did.
A new Gallup poll revealed that Americans' support for capitalism fell to 54% in 2025.(Fox News Digital )
Republicans’ views of capitalism have remained relatively unchanged, with three-quarters maintaining a positive opinion of the system.
Since 2010, Democrats’ favorability toward socialism has climbed from 50% to about two-thirds in 2025, while Republicans’ and independents’ views have generally remained steady.
FOX NEWS POLL: ECONOMIC PESSIMISM ABATES SLIGHTLY AS VOTERS REFLECT ON THE ECONOMY
As noted by Gallup, ""Democrats are the only partisan group of the three that views socialism more positively than capitalism — 66% to 42%, respectively. Independents are modestly more pro-capitalism than pro-socialism (51% vs. 38%), while Republicans are overwhelmingly so (74% vs. 14%).""
With support for capitalism declining, Americans’ view of big business has also soured. Just 37% currently have a favorable view, while 62% hold an unfavorable one.

Perceptions of big business have sharply declined in recent years, including a 9-point drop this year and a 6-point drop in 2021. Americans’ positive view peaked at 58% in 2012 and has declined every year since, except in 2019 when it gained two points before resuming its slide.

""Democrats’ more positive views of socialism occur at a time when many high-profile Democratic officials — most notably, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/chinas-currency-coup-how-beijing-targeting-americas-wallet-future,China's Currency Coup: How Beijing is targeting America's wallet and future,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich reports on China hosting North Korea's Kim Jong Un during a military parade and President Trump warning Vladimir Putin of consequences if he holds no meeting with Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
Last week, China showcased its military might and growing alliance with U.S. adversaries including Russia,North Koreaand, at least for now, India. But that show of force is not the only threat posed by today’s axis of evil.
Equally alarming is the insidious attack by China and its allies on theU.S. dollar, ringing alarms across global financial markets. China and other central banks have been stockpiling gold, diversifying their reserves away from U.S. government bonds, driving gold prices higher and Treasury yields up. Their allies have followed suit.
Does it matter to most Americans? Yes. A weaker dollar means traveling abroad and imported goods are more expensive, even without tariffs. Higher interest rates inflate borrowing costs.
GOLD MIGHT GLITTER, BUT IT'S STILL MONEY. TAXES SHOULD TREAT IT THAT WAY
Morgan Stanley reports, ""The value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies dropped about 11% in the first half of this year, the biggest decline in more than 50 years, ending a 15-year bull cycle."" The investment bank, writing last month, also noted that, ""The U.S. dollar ended the first half of 2025 with its biggest loss since 1973,"" and predicts more deterioration over the next 12 months.
While the dollar has been dropping, gold prices have surged. The Comex price for September delivery recently topped $3,600 per ounce, an all-time high. The price is up 45% over the past year.
In June, J.P. Morgan analysts predicted that gold prices would move higher in large part because of continued purchases by central banks. They wrote, ""Gold holdings by central banks amount to nearly 36,200 tonnes and account for almost 20% of official reserves, up from around 15% at the end of 2023, according to reported IMF data through the end of 2024.""
CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK CALLS ON STATE BANKS TO REDUCE US DOLLAR PURCHASES
""Diversification away from U.S. dollar reserve holdings, while still moderate, has been accelerating in recent years… The U.S. dollar share ended the year at around 57.8%, marking a 0.62 percentage point decline.""
Not all central banks have participated in the recent gold-buying spree. J.P. Morgan cited China, Poland, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan, Czechia and Iraq as the main players — not exactly a Who’s Who of U.S. allies.
Investors, too, have bought gold, especially in China. ""ETF inflows have sharply gained momentum, with year-to-date total inflows amounting to 310 tonnes — translating to around 10% in total global holdings. This has been fueled largely by a 9.5% increase in U.S. holdings and a 70% increase in Chinese ETF holdings.""
Why isChinaditching dollars and buying gold? To undermine the U.S. currency — and the U.S. itself. Beijing is pressing hard to dethrone the dollar and promote widespread adoption of the renminbi as the world’s reserve currency.
That is not going to happen any time soon, given Beijing’s currency manipulation, lack of reliable economic data and faltering economy. But raising doubts about the dollar’s strength serves China’s purpose, reducing investor appetite for dollar-denominated Treasuries. That forces the U.S. government to pay higher interest rates to attract buyers — a scenario already playing out.
COULD THE US DOLLAR LOSE ITS RESERVE CURRENCY STATUS TO CHINA?
The anti-Trump media has aided China’s cause with incessant alarmism about President Trump’s economic policies, especially his tariff program. Not surprisingly, the drumbeat of stories about tariffs, immigration enforcement, cuts to government agencies and high federal deficits has weighed on public optimism.
Optimism is important. People don’t buy homes, expand businesses or leave jobs for better opportunities unless they feel positive about the future.

A gloomy consumer could easily stall U.S. growth. Ironically, Bloomberg recently asked, ""The U.S. economy is still in pretty good shape. The unemployment rate is low and gross domestic product expanded at a 3.3% annualized pace in the second quarter. Yet Americans don’t exactly see it that way, and the nagging question is… why? Five years into an epic economic and stock market boom, why is everyone so negative?""
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Maybe Bloomberg should check its own headlines: ""U.S. Inflation to Rise as Higher Tariffs Feed Through"" and ""Trump Trade War Signals End of a Golden Era.""
Readers may have been surprised to see the Financial Times run a piece titled ""Bond investors count on Trump tariff revenues to rein in U.S. debt,"" suggesting that tariff income will ""bolster U.S. public finance in a sharp switch from earlier this year"" when investors had a uniformly negative view. When a lower court ruled Trump’s tariffs illegal last week, even critics admitted tariff revenues were substantial, valuable and would help reverse some of the damage from Joe Biden’s spending spree.
Neither China nor the liberal media will break the U.S. dollar or the economy. For the dollar to lose its reserve status, another currency would have to emerge — and that is not happening. Europe remains stagnant politically and economically, and Japan is in turmoil.

Meanwhile, investment incentives in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, combined with new White House trade deals, are already boosting U.S. investment. Jobs and tax revenues will follow.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessenttold NBC’s Kristen Welker over the weekend that we will see ""substantial acceleration"" in the economy by year’s end. If he is right, expect the dollar to rebound and China’s ambitions to be thwarted, at least for now.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/progressive-cities-face-billions-economic-losses-retail-crime-surges-93-since-2019,Progressive cities face billions in economic losses as retail crime surges 93% since 2019,"Chicago alderman Raymond Lopez joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the disconnect with crime statistics in the Windy City as Democrats resist federal help and the brutal killing of a Ukrainian refugee in Charlotte.
America’s great cities once stood as beacons of prosperity, culture and commerce. But today, many of them – especially those run by progressive, soft-on-crime leadership – are paying a staggering financial price for policies that putcriminals ahead of communities.
It’s not just about feeling unsafe when you walk to dinner or shop downtown. Crime has a balance sheet. In poorly led cities, that balance sheet is bleeding red ink by the day.
The Retail Exodus
Let’s start with the retail sector. According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), U.S. retailers lost $112 billion in 2022 due to theft, up from $94 billion the year before. In fact, in a recent study done by the NRF, retailers reported a 93% increase in the average number ofshoplifting incidentsper year in 2023 versus 2019 and a 90% increase in dollar loss due to shoplifting over the same time period.

That’s not just some rounding error – that’s the size of a medium country’s GDP wiped out because stores can’t keep merchandise on the shelves.
IRYNA ZARUTSKA FLED UKRAINE FOR SAFETY BUT DEMOCRATS' SOFT-ON-CRIME POLICIES FAILED HER
Big-box retailers aren’t standing still. Target alone projected $500 million in additional losses this year due to organized retail crime, much of it concentrated in blue-city hot spots likeSan Francisco, Portland and New York. Walgreens has closed dozens of stores in San Francisco. Nordstrom pulled out of downtown.
These aren’t ""mom-and-pop"" shops without resources. These are billion-dollar corporations deciding it’s better to retreat than to keep bleeding. Does it seem insane to you that so many of these retail stores have to lock up much of the merchandise in these cities so people don’t loot, knowing that they will never be arrested?
What follows the theft is a double hit: jobs vanish, and so does sales tax revenue. In San Francisco, commercial vacancies are now at a whopping 34.8% in downtown. Empty storefronts mean lost payrolls, lost foot traffic and declining city budgets.
BLAME DRUGS AND MENTAL ILLNESS, NOT PRESIDENT TRUMP, FOR THE CHAOS GRIPPING OUR STREETS
When leadership shrugs at rampant shoplifting, the real victim isn’t the corporation – it’s the local community that loses its economic engine.
High-End Property Values Are Declining
Crime doesn’t stop at the register. It seeps into neighborhoods and undermines the largest financial asset most Americans own: their homes. InChicago, blocks plagued by violent crime and open-air drug dealing are seeing higher-end condo and home values sink. Lower property values equal lower property taxes, which means less funding for schools, parks and infrastructure.
The Price Of Violence And Tourism
In New York, it costs $925 per day – or more than $337,000 per year – to incarcerate a single person. Yet instead of tackling the root causes of crime, city leaders continue to pump money into a cycle of arrest, release and repeat offenses. And overtime costs for the NYPD are spiraling as officers try to do more with less while politicians handcuff their ability to enforce the law.

Tourists aren’t stupid. If you don’t feel safe in Times Square or Union Square, you’ll take your vacation dollars elsewhere. Conventions are steering clear of cities with reputations for lawlessness. That meanslost hotel taxes, lost restaurant revenue, and lost brand value for cities that took decades to build their reputations.
Some 2 million fewer visitors from other countries are expected to make the trip toNew York Citythis year, which could cost the Big Apple $4 billion in foreign tourism dollars for 2025.
For New York City in particular, the stakes are enormous. And if individuals likeZohran Mamdani– who’s already argued for slashing police budgets – get their way, the costs will only grow. Defunding enforcement in the nation’s largest city would mean higher crime, lower investment and billions more drained from the budget. It’s a recipe for financial disaster.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
The Bottom Line
The cost of crime isn’t just what gets stolen from a store shelf. It’s measured in lost jobs, lower property values, higher taxes, ballooning public health costs and tarnished reputations. Poor leadership in blue cities is turning America’s once-great urban centers into cautionary tales of what happens when youstop enforcing the law.
If local leaders won’t prioritize public safety, they shouldn’t be surprised when businesses, families and capital walk away. Because, in the end, the real crime isn’t just happening on the streets – it’s in the budgets of poorly-led blue cities, where the cost of chaos is measured in billions.

A trend is sweepingcollege campusesnationwide as students head back to school while looking to make some extra cash.
Creating and selling content on OnlyFans – a website that allows adults to produce and post their own sexually explicit content in exchange for money from subscribers – has become a popular way for college students to earn extra income while in school.
""More and more people aren't getting married,"" Rock Jacobs, director of a documentary series about the online platform infiltrating college campuses called ""Lonely Fans,"" told Fox News Digital. ""More and more people aren’t having kids, and more and more people want to cut the line. And since the pandemic, there was this explosion of OnlyFans. The amount of money they're making is more than Google, more than Intel, more than the NBA.""

The platform has seen a sharp increase in traffic since the pandemic, with creators flocking to OnlyFans as a way to exchange virtual sex for money.
In 2019, the site featured approximately 350,000 creators from around the world on its platform, according to datafrom Statista. However, the number of creators has since skyrocketed to over 4.1 million in 2023 – signaling a staggering rise in users pushing content on the site.
""It's a payroll system,"" Jacobs told Fox News Digital. ""And what [creators] have been able to do is use sex to prey on lonely people, and because of technology anybody can have a payroll.""

In 2025, the average cost of college in the United States is roughly $38,270 a year, according to the Education Data Initiative. The cost has reportedly more than doubled in the 21st century, with student loan interest rates forcing students to pay as much as $500,000 for a bachelor’s degree.
""There's some people that really need money,"" Jacobs said. ""And this is such an easy way to do it. It comes quick, and you know [that] you will make money.""

Jacobs points to a notable shift in campus culture since he began filming his documentary series in 2023, with students initially remaining secretive about their online sexual endeavors.
""I think it’s become normalized,"" Jacobs told Fox News Digital. ""I’ve been working on [the film] since 2023, and at the beginning, I didn't think it was something that people were trying to hide. Now it’s something that people are proud about.""

In what could signify a startling cultural shift in career aspirations, Jacobs recounted overhearing a group of girls under 18 expressing interest in joining OnlyFans while filming a protest outside a California high school.
""There were girls coming out of the high school that said, ‘Oh, what's wrong with OnlyFans? We're going to do that as soon as we turn 18,’"" Jacobs said. ""It has turned itself into being something that people want to do right out of school instead of picking a real career.""
While the consequences of launching an OnlyFans account while in college could remain strictly social, Jacobs warns creators could also face life-threatening repercussions stemming from posting explicit content online.

""There’s one guy that literally drove five hours to a girl’s house,"" Jacobs said. ""[He] broke into her house and was living in her attic.""
""The stalkers can be digital, but it can actually turn physical and real – and in some cases, it can get violent.""
Jacobs also pointed to another woman’s testimonial featured in the documentary.
""She’s done really well [and] she’s made over a couple million dollars,"" Jacobs said. ""She’s been able to change her entire life and set herself up. But she admitted that every night when she goes to sleep, she feels like someone’s going to break into her house and murder her.

""Psychologically, it offers instant gratification, attention, validation and income all at once,"" Alpert told Fox News Digital. ""Those same rewards can create dependency and affect self-worth. Students risk tying their identity and confidence to clicks and subscribers. What is framed as independence often masks a deeper vulnerability.""

Jacobs echoes the same concerns, whilewarning parentsthat the rise of college students turning to OnlyFans to achieve online fame and fortune is threatening the future of family values.
""If we keep moving and normalizing this type of behavior, then family values are going to be diminished,"" Jacobs said. ""And how are you going to have those deep roots when you send your child off into the world so that they are able to control themselves and restrain themselves from certain things?""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/social-media-firestorm-after-massive-georgia-immigration-raid-taking-bold-action,Social media firestorm erupts after massive Georgia immigration raid: 'Taking bold action',"Fox News correspondent Madison Scarpino discusses the immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia on ‘America Reports.’
Social media erupted across the political spectrum following Thursday's federal immigration raid at a Hyundai mega plant in Georgia that resulted in the arrests of about 475 suspects, most of whom wereKorean nationals.
The raid, about 20 miles outside of Savannah, was part of a long-term investigation and is one of many notable worksite operations that have occurred amid the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown. Hyundai officials said they do not believe any of their direct employees were arrested but said it would ""comply with all laws and regulations.""
LG Energy Solution, which also plays a role in the plant, also said it will work with authorities.
Some took aim at the fact that the factory was touted by former President Joe Biden, as both Democratic and Republican politicians have hailed the project as a win for American manufacturing. The EV manufacturing part of the facility is not believed to have been impacted, but the battery factory under construction was the focus of the multi-agency effort.

Others criticized the Trump administration, as the South Korean government also expressed concerns about the operation.
""Completely incredible. Lutnick and Trump brag about getting South Korea to invest billions in the U.S., then turn around and arrest South Koreans who were here temporarily in the U.S. to help Hyundai set up a factory in Georgia. The stupidity burns,"" writer James Surowiecki posted.
Rep. Nikema Williams, D-Ga., wrote that the raid was an ""act of cruelty and injustice"" by theTrump administration.
""Reportedly, U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents have also been wrongfully detained,"" she posted. ""This administration is actively working to instill fear and chaos within our most marginalized communities. Due process is not optional, it is the law. The administration needs to follow it and abide by the constitutional rights of every worker affected.""

A Hyundai factory under construction near Savannah, Georgia, that was the subject of a massive immigration raid was previously touted by former PresidentJoe Bidenand other politicians as a win for manufacturing jobs in the United States.
Homeland Security Investigations said 475 people who were in the country illegally, primarily from South Korea, were arrested as part of the operation at the under-construction battery plant. However, the car company claimed nobody detained was ""directly employed"" by Hyundai.
The incident brings renewed scrutiny on construction sites of large projects as the Trump administration continues to investigate illegal worksite practices.
""It’s great to be here to announce the more than $10 billion in new investment in American manufacturing. This new commitment of $5 billion for advanced automotive technology and $5.5 billion investment to open a new factory near Savannah, Georgia, is going to create more than 8,000 new American jobs,"" Biden said while visiting South Korea in May 2022.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, touted the project last February in anX postpraising the ""momentum"" of the project.
The effort is a partnership between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution to bolster EV development in the U.S.
HSI said some of the workers arrested were employed by subcontractors on the construction site, which has since been paused. An EV manufacturing plant on the campus was not affected. Fox News Digital reported that ICE and other law enforcement agencies were part of the operation.
""As of today, it is our understanding that none of those detained is directly employed by Hyundai Motor Company,""Hyundai told Fox News Digitalin a statement. ""We prioritize the safety and well-being of everyone working at the site and comply with all laws and regulations wherever we operate.""

FIRST ON FOX:Ohio Republican Sen.Bernie Morenois introducing legislation aimed at penalizing companies who outsource jobs and operations overseas while at the same time providing financial support to avenues that create American jobs.
The bill, introduced on Friday and known as the ""Halting International Relocation of Employment Act"" or ""HIRE Act,"" creates a 25% tax on ""outsourcing payments"" which are defined as any money paid by a U.S. company or taxpayer to a foreign person whose work benefits U.S. consumers.
The bill also includes anti-abuse language to prevent tax avoidance via U.S. territories and requires U.S. firms to fully disclose all outsourcing payments and contracts. Companies will also be prohibited from deducting any outsourcing payments.
Money raised by the penalty on spending on overseas workers will be used to support apprenticeship programs in the United States as well as workforce development programs.

Additionally, the legislation, if passed through Republican-controlled Congress and signed by the Republican president, would prohibit companies from treating outsourcing payments as base erosion payments when they calculate their Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax.
""While college grads in America struggle to find work, globalist politicians and C-Suite executives have spent decades shipping good-paying jobs overseas in pursuit of slave wages and immense profits—those days are over,"" Moreno told Fox News Digital in a statement.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/texas-congressman-unveils-new-plan-tackle-37t-national-debt-tariff-windfall-revenues,Texas congressman unveils new plan to tackle $37T national debt with tariff windfall revenues,"Associate White House counsel Graziella Pastor relays the urgency of the looming Supreme Court decision on President Donald Trump's authority to impose tariffs under a state of emergency.
FIRST ON FOX:Texas Rep. Nathaniel Moran is turning tariffs into a debt-cutting tool, unveiling legislation that would funnel billions in new trade revenues into a trust fund aimed solely at shrinking America’s staggering $37 trillionnational debt.
The Tariff Revenue Used to Secure Tomorrow (TRUST) Act would establish a special account at the Treasury Department called the Tariff Trust Fund. Starting in fiscal year 2026, any tariff money collected above the 2025 baseline level would automatically go into this fund. By law, that money could only be spent in one way: to shrink the federal deficit whenever the government is running in the red.
""President Trump’s bold use of tariffs has already proven effective in bringing foreign nations back to the negotiating table and securing better trade deals for America. That short-term success has produced record-high revenues, and now we need to make sure Washington doesn’t squander them,"" Moran told Fox News Digital.
TRUMP SAYS US WOULD BE 'DESTROYED' WITHOUT TARIFF REVENUE
""The TRUST Act ensures those dollars go where they are needed most—toward reducing our national debt and protecting the financial future of our nation.""
Moran's legislation comes after the U.S. collected more than $31 billion intariff revenuesin August, the highest monthly total so far for 2025. Total tariff revenue for 2025 has reached more than $183.6 billion, according to the ""Customs and Certain Excise Taxes"" data released on Aug. 29 by the Treasury Department.
Tariff revenues rose steadily from $17.4 billion in April to $23.9 billion in May, before climbing to $28 billion in June and reaching $29 billion in July. At the current pace, the U.S. could collect as much tariff revenue in just four months to five months as it did during the entire previous year. At this point in fiscal year 2024, tariff revenues were at $86.5 billion.

TRUMP CALLS TARIFF WINDFALL 'SO BEAUTIFUL TO SEE' AS CASH SAILS IN
The surge in revenue coincides with a federal appeals court ruling that PresidentDonald Trumpoverstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose sweeping global tariffs.
In its Aug. 29 decision, the court said the power to set such tariffs rests squarely with Congress or within existing trade policy frameworks. The ruling does not affect tariffs imposed by other legal authorities, such as Trump’s levies on steel and aluminum imports.
Attorney GeneralPam Bondiannounced the Justice Department will appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. In the meantime, the court allowed the tariffs to remain in place through Oct. 14.

Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentpreviously said that the Trump administration could apply part of the tariff revenue toward lowering the national debt.
The nation's debt, which is the amount of money the U.S. owes its creditors, is nearing$37.4 trillionas of Sept. 3, according to the Treasury Department.
The staggering figure has intensified the long-standing debate in Washington over government spending, taxation and efforts to rein in the ballooning deficit.

""Complacency is no longer an option. We must act with urgency and begin to bring down our national debt immediately,"" Moran added in a statement.
Bessent has also previously said that tariffs could generate more than $500 billion in revenue for the federal government. U.S. businesses pay these import taxes to the federal government, but the cost often falls on consumers, as companies raise prices to offset the economic burden.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sec-scott-turner-blame-drugs-mental-illness-not-president-trump-chaos-gripping-our-streets,"SEC SCOTT TURNER: Blame drugs and mental illness, not President Trump, for the chaos gripping our streets","HUD Secretary Scott Turner says the Trump administration is collecting data to make sure illegal aliens do not live in HUD housing on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'
PresidentDonald Trumpis bringing peace and stability back to D.C.’s crime-ridden streets. He is ending the chaos in our capital, restoring beauty to the city and making the district safer for all Americans.
The president’s commonsense policy has also exposed the depth of misguided anger toward our men and women in uniform, with the most recent example being the bitterness shown by activists against theNational Guard. Unfortunately, this hostility toward those who defend against lawlessness goes beyond street mobs harassing the brave men and women fighting crime.
In 2024, the Biden administration published a Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Continuum of Care (CoC) program, which was designed to fund organizations working to address homelessness. We quickly found that, like many department programs, this one had strayed from its original intent, becoming a mismanaged slush fund that enabled endless government-supported homelessness rather than delivering real solutions.

What we uncovered exposes the severity of the waste, fraud and abuse under the Biden administration, as well as its disdain forlaw enforcement. The NOFO revealed an administration that prioritized awarding HUD funds to groups that refused to helpfully cooperate with law enforcement.
HERE'S WHY HELPING THE HOMELESS REBUILD THEIR LIVES IS KEY TO AMERICA’S FUTURE SUCCESS
Biden’s HUD rewarded groups that ""…minimize(d) use of law enforcement to enforce bans on public sleeping, public camping, or carrying out basic life functions in public places.""
That policy was rooted in a worldview that treats law enforcement as the enemy. From the ""defund the police"" rhetoric to ""don’t work with the police"" policies, this animosity toward those who enforce the law has become deeply embedded in the Democratic Party.
But let’s be clear: the real enemy when it comes to helping Americans living on the street is not those who risk their lives to uphold law and order, it is the cycle of endless government handouts thatbankroll homelessnesswhile ignoring its root causes.
Those root causes are addiction and untreated mental illness. And they’re on full display in our cities. Sprawling encampments, public drug use andrandom violent attackswreak havoc in the major cities Americans call home. Every day, overdoses claim lives and the most vulnerable fall victim to violence.
THE LEFT'S HOMELESS PLANS WRECKED OUR CITIES. NOW HELP MAY COME FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE
This status quo is unacceptable. That’s why HUD is driving a paradigm shift to end this crisis.
At HUD, our responsibility is both to the most vulnerable Americans and to taxpayers whose hard-earned dollars we’re entrusted to steward. No one should suffer on our streets, and no one should walk them in fear.
The Biden administration spent four years denying the commonsense reality that street-level homelessness is a public safety crisis driven by addiction and mental illness. During that time, more than $12 billion of working Americans’ taxpayer dollars was funneled into the CoC program with nothing but record high rates of homelessness to show. In cities like Los Angeles and New York, billions more in local resources have been wasted.
How did we get here? Through failed leadership that demanded blind fealty to ""Housing First"" – an ideology that promotes fully subsidized housing, forever, with zero strings attached.
I’M A BLUE STATE MAYOR AND THE FUTURE OF HOMELESSNESS SCARES ME
But our goal is to let HUD use real, proven effective strategies, and there is no evidence that giving free apartments to the homeless without preconditions or participation requirements – like job training or treatment – leads to good outcomes.
There isevidence, however, that countless lives have been lost to overdoses in HUD-funded housing because of this failed ideology.
According to HUD’s most recent data, residents were twice as likely to die in ""permanent supportive housing"" for the homeless than to move into unsubsidized housing, and the death rate of heads of households in these units went up by almost a third from 2019-2022. Local governments report that they’re more likely to lose people to overdoses in isolatedsubsidized housingand hotel rooms than outside on the streets.

Another tragic failure of progressivism’s response to homelessness has been the systematic exclusion of faith-based organizations. That policy changed when Americans elected President Trump, because this administration recognizes that the very first organizations to serve the homeless in this nation were Christian ministries – and that they continue to be core partners in this mission to this day.
I’ve walked the halls of shelter programs, transitional housing, and recovery centers where life transformation happens every day because of the faith of the men and women who serve there, who clothe, feed and care for those made in God’s image. These faithful servants empower the vulnerable to take steps to recover and become self-sufficient.
I’ve witnessed the power of faith firsthand, and HUD will continue to support this vital work as a key part of our campaign to tackle homelessness.

The paradigm has shifted, and my message is this: to the organizations restoring self-sufficiency to broken lives, HUD wants to partner with you. To the working Americans who have entrusted us with your resources, HUD is wisely stewarding every dollar. To the law enforcement officers protecting our communities, HUD recognizes you as critical in making our streets safer. To the men and women who have come out of addiction and homelessness, HUD sees you as proof that recovery is possible.
And to everyone caught in the throes of addiction on our streets, recovery is possible for you too.

The Free Press editor Bari Weiss joins Americas Newsroom to discuss the threat of Iran.
CBS News could be headed for a major editorial shakeup, with reports indicating that The Free Press founderBari Weissis set to join the network, and insiders are reacting with a mix of curiosity, caution and optimism.
New Paramount CEODavid Ellisonhas long been rumored to covet Weiss and The Free Press, which she founded after dramatically leaving The New York Times in 2020. Puck’s Dylan Byers reported Wednesday that ""the two sides have agreed in principle to a deal"" with a price tag between $100 million and $200 million, and Weiss would take on a role guiding ""the editorial direction"" of CBS News.
Weiss, who built her brand around the notion that legacy outlets suffer from liberal groupthink, is sure to shake things up. Puck reported the move ""would inevitably inspire blowback from various corners of the newsroom,"" but not everyone at CBS News is alarmed.
""Maybe more free thought, free expression is on the way. Nothing to fear here,"" one CBS News staffer toldFox News Digital.

A second CBS News employee said people have been sharing the Puck report internally but ""nobody knows what it will mean or look like"" once Weiss actually joins the network. They noted CBS News has ""dozens"" of middle managers and other editorial executives, and everyone is in the dark about how Weiss would work with them.
The employee did note, however, that CBS desperately needs to climb out of third place after years of its evening and morning newscasts finishing behind both ABC and NBC.
""I don’t know much about her, but I think if she can bring more eyes to us or more revenue, I don’t see how that’s a bad thing,"" the staffer told Fox News Digital.
CBS News declined comment. Paramount and The Free Press did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Weissfamously ditched the Timeswith a scathing resignation letter in which she detailed bullying by then colleagues in an ""illiberal environment."" Her resignation letter addressed directly to Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger sent shock waves across the media industry as she detailed a toxic work environment.
""Showing up for work as a centrist at an American newspaper should not require bravery,"" she wrote.
Weiss launched the ""Common Sense"" newsletter in 2021 before rebranding it as The Free Press and expanding it into a full-fledged media company in 2022. Earlier this year, The Free Press touted having more than155,000 payingsubscribers, and Puck reported it was recently valued at $100 million.
A third CBS News staffer, before the recent reports that the Ellison-Weiss deal was on the ""one-yard line,"" praised Weiss for having ""done something amazing"" with The Free Press and said her critiques of legacy media had resonated with them. They said Weiss would bring ""a very strong critique of legacy media as it is"" into the halls of CBS News.

Not everyone is optimistic, as the liberal Status newsletter spoke to other CBS staffers and believes hiring the staunchly pro-Israel Weiss would ""set off a firestorm inside the newsroom, especially over coverage of Israel and Gaza.""
""Not happy AT ALL,"" one staffer told Status. Another said staffers would be ""apoplectic"" if they had to take editorial directions from Weiss.
Restoring the reputation of CBS News appears to be a priority for Ellison, who visited CBS News’ New York City headquarters minutes after taking control of the newly merged company last month. He popped into an editorial meeting, toured the office and briefly met with CBS News executives, including ""60 Minutes"" executive producer Tanya Simon.
A longtime network news producer, who has worked at rival networks, believes Weiss should keep her head on a swivel because veteran CBS News staffers are ""very good"" at undermining new management.
""If Bari Weiss thinks the New York Times were bullies, wait until she shows up at CBS News,"" the producer told Fox News Digital.

""They will eat her alive, backstab her, destroy her reputation and humiliate her,"" they warned. ""Can you imagine her trying to tell Tanya Simon, whose father was held hostage in an Iraqi prison, how to cover Gaza?""
Ellison has not named a new long-term head of CBS News and has refused to comment on ""rumors,"" although employees say they enjoy working with current CBS News president Tom Cibrowski, who joined the company earlier this year.
Cibrowski was close with former CBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon, who was pushed out ahead of Ellison’s takeover. McMahon said, ""It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.""

American workers are front and center in the race to stay ahead of China. There just aren’t enough of them. Jobs are going unfilled from advanced semiconductor foundries to the drydocks where theU.S. Navy’s combat ships are built. Ships and chips are both in crisis.
And no,AI by itself isn’t the answer.
""We’ve spent the last 10 years teaching people how to code. We need to spend the next 10 years teaching people how to use their hands,"" Navy Secretary John Phelan said July 16 in Detroit.
TARIFF UNCERTAINTY THREATENS $490B IN US MANUFACTURING INVESTMENT, REPORT WARNS
It's shipfitters, blasters, superconducting process integration managers and semiconductor equipment technicians who will ensure the USA beats China. Both ships and chips rely on touch labor — albeit in very sophisticated factories and foundries.

President Donald Trump gets it. ""Every policy of the Trump administration is designed to lift up the American worker, promote great-paying, blue-collar jobs and to rebuild the industrial bedrock of our nation,"" he said Aug. 26.
Not that you’ll see just blue collars anymore: look for black T-shirts, plaid flannel, white clean room ""bunny suits"" and engineers in polos. But the essentials are the same. This critical workforce is made up of men and women who’ve built their technical expertise and thrive on getting the job done, whether with a crane or a lithography machine.
NEW STUDY REVEALS THREATS TO THE CLASS OF 2025. FIXING THEM SHOULD BE JOB NO. 1 FOR AMERICA
Here’s the stunning problem. Although both ships and chips sectors are booming with urgent programs and new opportunities, America as a nation has devalued the trades and is paying the price. Themanufacturing sector'sworkforce decline due to decades of globalism has been so sharp that U.S. national security and economic dominance are at risk.
Just 3% of the American population today work in manufacturing, versus 9% during the Cold War. COVID-19 hit hard. Texas, Florida and Georgia have added enough manufacturing jobs to surge ahead of their pre-pandemic employment levels, but almost half of U.S. states still have lower manufacturing totals than 2019.
Unless reversed, the decline in manufacturing labor could hurt America’s position.
NAVY RECRUITMENT 'SKYROCKETS' UNDER TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, OFFICIAL SAYS
You already know America’s Navy is smaller than China’s. TheNavy’s own shipyardsneed to hire 250,000 new workers over the next decade for maintenance, construction and repair. Add in the shipbuilders who are trying to accelerate new submarines, aircraft carriers and destroyers, and workforce shortages threaten maritime dominance over China.

Priority No. 1 is pay. Trump said that wages for blue-collar workers are rising at the fastest rate in 60 years. Wages for welders on nuclear submarines need to be much higher than fast food and delivery trucks. It’s not just entry-leveljobs.Shipyards must retain experienced shipfitters ready to step up as foremen and boost the talent pool for hundreds of major suppliers. The wider plan is ""the nation as a shipyard"" with a combination of investment and tapping new labor pools to make ship modules in locations where labor abounds.
TheU.S. share of global semiconductor manufacturingfell from 40% in 1990 to 12% in 2020. With a projected 33% growth in semiconductor jobs by 2030, the gap between job openings and qualified candidates will leave 146,000 positions unfilled. More workers are being sought for both commercial semiconductors, and for the advanced composite chips used in defense electronics.
Here’s the stunning problem. Although both ships and chips sectors are booming with urgent programs and new opportunities, America as a nation has devalued the trades and is paying the price.
These aren’t your day-to-day, mass-produced silicon chips; think multi-layered chips powering information systems for satellites, F-16 fighters, radars, Apache helicopters and more. And many are smaller than a grain of sand. Production at one advanced Linthicum, Maryland, foundry alone will quadruple by 2030 — if they can hire.

The good news is thatmanufacturingis starting a resurgence, according to the St. Louis Fed. Investment in new facilities has doubled since 2022.

Now, he should school them on education","Parents Defending Education researcher Rhyen Staley sounds off on a report finding that America's two largest teachers' unions have funneled nearly $50 million to left-wing groups since 2022.
PresidentDonald Trumpis driving clueless Democrats to embrace the losing side of many issues, like opposing his efforts to drive down crime, favoring open borders and encouraging biological men to compete in women’s sports.
There is another critical cause Trump should champion that will put Democrats even more on the defensive — our failing public schools. The time is right; parents are unhappy with their children’s schools and AI promises huge improvements, if we can get the teachersunionsout of the way.
In the coming days, America’s children will head back to the classroom. Many families will look forward with excitement to a new academic year of achievement and progress. For others, and especially those trapped in the failing schools of Democrat-run cities like New York and Chicago, the new year will bring defeat and disappointment.
TRUMP DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ROLLS OUT LATEST STEP TO EXPAND SCHOOL CHOICE NATIONWIDE
Far too many of our nation’s children — disproportionately Black and brown kids — will again be left behind. Excuses will be made, standards will be lowered and parents will wonder whether their children have any shot at the American dream.

Democratic politicians pretend to care about children, but every year that goes by confirms they care more about the tens of millions of dollars they harvest from the teachers' unions.
In this year’s annual Mood of the Nation survey, Gallup found only 24% of Americans satisfied with publiceducation,a record low and one of the least favorable readings posted on any issue. During the pandemic, when unions demanded that schools close and classes went online, parents saw firsthand the woke garbage being taught to their kids. Something broke.
LINDA MCMAHON PULLS BACK THE CURTAIN ON TRUMP'S PLAN TO DISMANTLE THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
With AI rocketing into reality and infusing every industry with the possibility of enormous productivity gains, the time has come to combat the rigid authoritarianism of the teachers unions.Trump should lead that charge.
In New York City, the nonprofit Citizens Budget Commission estimates that the Department of Education will spendmore than $42,000 per childthis year, more than any other big city in the country and one-third more than was spent just five years ago.
And what do families in the Big Apple get for that outrageous sum, which accounts for nearly one third of the city’s budget? As reported recently in the New York Post, just 33% of Big Apple fourth graders scored proficiency in math and 28% in reading on the National Assessment of Educational Progress last year. Older students’ results were worse – 23% of city eighth graders met the national standards in math and 29% in reading.""
Imagine, taxpayers are spending private-school-level sums and getting results that should shame the country and the city. To repeat, only 23 of 100 kids in eighth grade can do math at grade level and 29 can read, and those results benefit from ever-shifting goal posts. What about the other kids? Does anybody care?
LARGEST TEACHERS UNION SLAMS 'UNLAWFUL' CUTS TO DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AFTER SUPREME COURT RULING
InChicago, spending per student is nearly $20,000, which does not include some items thrown into the NYC totals, like debt service. Chicago’s school outlays have nearly doubled over the past decade, while scores and standards have fallen, as in New York. Last year, only some 29% of Chicago kids could read at grade level, and 18% — less than one in five — of kids were proficient at math.
As in New York, the failure rate among minorities is especially worrisome. While 29% of all Chicago eighth-grade students passed algebra, for instance, fewer than 17% of Black kids succeeded in doing so.

The poor performance of Chicago’s schools is not surprising, considering that, according to the Illinois Report Card, the system suffered chronic absenteeism of 41% in 2024. Worse, the chronic absenteeism rate for the city’s teachers was also about 41%.
Who is speaking up for those Black kids who are falling behind? It certainly isn’t theteachers unions.Recent contract negotiations with the Chicago Teachers Union started out with union bosses making 700 demands, estimated to cost $10 billion. Some of the demands had nothing to do with educating students, but focused on adding a ""restorative justice coordinator in every school,"" more holidays for teachers, establishing a ""scratch kitchen, so students can eat culturally relevant, nourishing lunches,"" less accountability, gender-affirming care and ""queer competent trained service providers.""

Teachers unions across the nation work to plump up their own salaries and benefits, which is their job, but they also spend millions electing politicians like Johnson that do their bidding, which has little to do with making sure our kids can compete in the 21st century.
Trump has taken a good first step in boosting our education system by dismantling much of theDepartment of Educationand sending more authority over our schools back to the states. He also issued an executive order overturning the disastrous Obama-Biden guidance mandating that disciplining of students must consider race and equity, which reduced safety in schools. And, he has encouraged widespread instruction in the use of AI.
But more can be done. For instance, the president must encourage the continued expansion ofschool choice.Since 2021, 11 GOP-led states controlled by Republican legislatures have adopted policies giving parents a choice of schooling, including public, private, charter or home-based education options. Increased competition will raise standards; public schools will no longer get a free pass.

The U.S. collected more than $30 billion intariff revenuesin August, already the highest monthly total so far for 2025 — and with more data still to be reported.
Total tariff revenue for 2025 has reached more than $183 billion, according to the latest ""Customs and Certain Excise Taxes"" data released Thursday by the Treasury Department. Tariff revenue for Friday through Sunday has not yet been reported.
TRUMP SAYS US WOULD BE 'DESTROYED' WITHOUT TARIFF REVENUE
Tariff revenues rose steadily from $17.4 billion in April to $23.9 billion in May, before climbing to $28 billion in June and reaching $29 billion in July.
At the current pace, the U.S. could collect as much tariff revenue in just four months to five months as it did during the entire previous year.
Compared to this time in 2025, tariff revenues were at $86.5 billion for the fiscal year.

The surge in revenue coincides with a federal appeals court ruling that PresidentDonald Trumpoverstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose sweeping global tariffs.
TRUMP CALLS TARIFF WINDFALL 'SO BEAUTIFUL TO SEE' AS CASH SAILS IN
In its Friday decision, the court said the power to set such tariffs rests squarely with Congress or within existing trade policy frameworks. The ruling does not affect tariffs imposed by other legal authorities, such as Trump’s levies on steel and aluminum imports.

Bellhops, concierges, hotel and motel desk clerks and housekeepers should all benefit in the hospitality business.
In home services, repair workers, landscapers, electricians, plumbers, heating and AC mechanics and installers, appliance installers or repairers, home cleaning workers, locksmiths and roadside assistanceworkers are all included.
For the personal services and wellness industries, event planners, event photographers and videographers, personal care and service workers, event officials, pet caretakers, tutors, nannies and babysitters, skincare specialists, massage therapists, shampooers, manicurists and pedicurists, eyebrow threading or waxing technicians, makeup artists, fitness trainers, tattoo artists and piercers, tailors and shoe repairers are also listed.

Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.

WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR
Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reducecarbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.
WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM

This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy productionwith agriculture. Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.
Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.
Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.
Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't justpower generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.

Sheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators.(REUTERS/Annie Rice)
This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.
At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.
Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.

If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.
For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fightclimate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.

Sheep-powered solar farms are transforming the way we manage clean energy sites. By replacing gas-powered machines with grazing animals, solar companies are cutting costs,reducing emissionsand creating new income opportunities for farmers. This approach blends sustainability with practicality. It supports healthier soil, boosts biodiversity and strengthens rural economies, all while helping solar farms operate more efficiently. With growing investment and proven results, solar grazing is emerging as a smart, scalable solution.

Though the Trump administration is confident it set the stage for such positive outcomes through deregulation and increased energy output, not everyone agrees on the cause.
Analysts in a CNN report on gas prices, including CIBC Private Wealth senior energy trader Rebecca Babin, pointed to Saudi Arabia-led OPEC’s willingness to ramp up production as a key factor.
At the same time, the White House is pushing its ""America First"" vision, framing gas prices, wage growth, and consumer confidence as proof that workers are better off under President Donald Trump's leadership.

PresidentDonald Trumprecently canceled public-employee union contracts for thousands of federal workers. The employees worked in agencies tied to national security, allowing Trump to invoke a national security exemption to the normal rules governing federal employees. Trump’s decision builds on his March executive order expanding the agencies covered by the exemption.
It is the latest step in a series of battles over public-sector unionism at the federal level that goes back more than a century — a debate that touches on key aspects of democratic governance.
In 1902, PresidentTheodore ""Teddy"" Rooseveltissued an order barring federal workers and postal employees from lobbying Congress. His successor, William Howard Taft, took a similar action in 1909 with Executive Order 1142, which focused on preventing lobbying by members of the military. Congress overturned these orders in 1912 with the Lloyd-La Follette Act, but the move did not lead to widespread public-sector unionism.

In 1919, Massachusetts Gov. Calvin Coolidge put himself on the political map when he fired striking Boston police officers. When he made this decision, Coolidge famously declared: ""There is no right to strike against the public safety, anywhere, anytime."" Coolidge’s action was an important factor in Warren Harding choosing Coolidge as his vice presidential nominee in 1920.
FEDERAL JUDGE RULES AGAINST TRUMP ADMIN IN LAWSUIT AGAINST GOVERNMENT LABOR UNIONS
The Harding-Coolidge ticket defeated Ohio Gov. James Cox and New York’s Franklin Roosevelt. Coolidge became president when Harding died in 1923. Roosevelt eventually made it to the White House in 1932. But as president, Roosevelt recognized the dangers of public-sector unionism and opposed it. The 1935 Wagner Act, which boosted the power of private-sector unions, specifically exempted public-sector unions from its protections, stating that federal, state and local governments were not to be considered ""employers"" with the same obligations Wagner imposed on the private sector.
In 1937, Roosevelt wrote a pivotal letter to the president of the Federation of Federal Employees. According to Roosevelt: ""All government employees should realize that the process of collective bargaining, as usually understood, cannot be transplanted into the public service.""

Roosevelt’s reasoning was crystal clear and has been frequently cited by conservatives — and conveniently ignored by liberals. He warned: ""The very nature and purposes of government make it impossible for administrative officials to represent fully or to bind the employer in mutual discussions with government employee organizations.""
TRUMP'S CONTROVERSIAL PLAN TO FIRE FEDERAL WORKERS FINDS FAVOR WITH SUPREME COURT
In 1939, the Hatch Act included language limiting political activity by public-sector workers. The act, passed by a Democratic Congress under a Democratic president, stemmed from concerns about political activity by employees at Roosevelt’s Works Progress Administration during the 1936 election. Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins, director of the WPA, had been accused of promising jobs for votes, leading to congressional outcry and the passage of the law.
A big change toward the acceptance of public-sector unions came during the John F. Kennedy administration. In 1962, Kennedy issued Executive Order 10988, explicitly allowing federal employees to form unions and bargain collectively. But as Ira Stoll points out in his book ""JFK, Conservative,"" Kennedy also recognized important limitations. His order did not include the words ""collective bargaining.""

He understood, like FDR, the inherent conflict of interest in granting those rights to government employees. In addition, the order said the government should not recognize any union ""which asserts the right to strike against the government of the United States or any agency thereof… or which advocates the overthrow of the constitutional form of the government in the United States.""
This language showed disapproval of strikes by public-sector unions and concerns about communist influence. Kennedy also exempted the FBI and CIA from public-sector unionism because of national security concerns — a precursor to Trump’s recent actions.
If there was one president who did the most to promote public-sector unionism in the federal government, it wasJimmy Carter. Public-sector unionism had already been rising at the local level when Carter was elected in 1976. Recognizing this trend, Victor Gotbaum, head of New York’s American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), bragged in 1975, ""We have the power, in a sense, to elect our own boss.""
President Jimmy Carter addressing a town meeting.
When Carter signed the 1978 Civil Service Reform Act, he expanded union power at the federal level. The law granted most federal employees the right to join unions and bargain over the ""conditions of [their] employment."" Even though it included a national security exemption, the CSRA was a major step toward the current era in which, according to Philip Howard’s 2023 book ""Not Accountable,"" ""the abuse of power by public employee unions is the main story of public failure in America — worse even, I believe, than polarization or red tape.""
Carter also created the Department of Education, long sought by teachers' unions. They have been paying back Democrats ever since. A new report shows the top two teachers' unions have given almost $50 million to left-wing groups since 2022.

Carter’s successor,Ronald Reagan, pushed back in August 1981 when he fired 11,345 illegally striking air traffic controllers. Reagan issued a statement he wrote himself: ""We cannot compare labor-management relations in the private sector with government. Government cannot close down the assembly line. It has to provide without interruption the protective services which are government’s reason for being.… Those who fail to report for duty… are in violation of the law, and if they do not report for work within 48 hours, they have forfeited their jobs and will be terminated.""
Reagan’s move had far-reaching implications. It showed the Soviets he was a man of his word, helped him maneuver more effectively on the world stage and boosted his political standing at home. Most importantly, it demonstrated that the federal government could limit the right of federal employees to strike. There had been two dozen strikes by federal workers in the two decades before Reagan’s action. There have been none since.

Since then, political organizing — not striking — has been the main battleground for public-sector unions. They overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates, using dues to fund campaigns.
In 1988, theSupreme Courtin Communications Workers v. Beck required unions to give workers the ability to opt out of the portion of mandatory dues spent on politics. In April 1992, in the midst of a tough re-election campaign, PresidentGeorge H.W. Bushissued an executive order implementing Beck by requiring federal contractors to notify employees of their Beck rights. Bush said: ""Full implementation… will guarantee that no American will have his job or livelihood threatened for refusing to contribute to political activities against his will.""
Bill Clinton, Bush’s Democratic opponent, denounced the order on the campaign trail. According to a Bush White House estimate, if every eligible worker requested a refund, union funds for campaign activities would be reduced by $2.4 billion — nearly all of it aiding Democrats. As president, Clinton revoked the order. When George W. Bush took office, he reinstated it, showing how partisan the issue had become.

Another key fight has been over the scope of public-sector union coverage. During the creation of the Department of Homeland Security after the 9/11 attacks, George W. Bush sought to exempt DHS employees from union requirements. He won legislatively, but court decisions later limited many of those exemptions. Trump’s recent actions echo that battle as he seeks to extend exemptions to agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs. Courts will decide whether his moves fall within the law.

Looking back, presidents as different as Theodore Roosevelt, Coolidge, Franklin Roosevelt, Kennedy, Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Trump all agreed on one thing: limiting the scope of public-sector unions, especially in national security. Unfortunately, today the issue is highly partisan, with Democrats staunchly in favor of public-sector unions and Republicans looking to curtail their power.
On this Labor Day, we should celebrate American workers while recognizing the difference between hardworking citizens and public-sector unions that use their power to elect their own bosses.

After the long holiday weekend, PresidentDonald Trumpwill begin contending with significant legal disputes unfolding on multiple fronts. From the Federal Reserve to trade policy to deportations of illegal immigrants, here's a look at the high-stakes legal showdowns shaping Trump’s week.
U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb, aBidenappointee, signaled on Friday she will seek to rule quickly on whether Trump acted unlawfully in moving to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over mortgage fraud allegations. She didn’t make a rulingduring the two-hour hearingbut told both sides to submit more filings by Sept 2. Only then will she decide whether to issue an order that temporarily protects Cook’s job while the case continues.
TRUMP SAYS HE’S ‘ALWAYS’ READY FOR LEGAL FIGHT AS OUSTED FED GOVERNOR PLANS LAWSUIT
Trump's unprecedented attempt to oust Cook sets the stage for a high-stakes legal battle likely bound for theSupreme Court.

Trump fired Cook on Aug. 25, which prompted her to sue him in federal court three days later. Her lawsuit names as defendants Trump, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and Federal Reserve ChairmanJerome Powell.
It is not clear if Cook has attempted to enter the Federal Reserve's main headquarters in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood in D.C. since Trump's letter terminating her. TheFederal Reservedeclined to say whether Cook has tried to work from her office, is working remotely, or retains access to the email and other resources she needs for her job.
Before Cook filed her suit, a Fed spokesperson acknowledged the potential legal feud and wrote in an Aug. 26 statement that the Fed will ""abide by any court decision.""
COOK’S POTENTIAL EXIT HANDS TRUMP GREATER SWAY OVER FED BOARD SHAPING US MONETARY POLICY
In a different legal case, Judge Cobb issued a temporary order preventing the Trump administration from carrying out expedited deportations of illegal immigrants. The policy would have allowed some to be deported without first going before an immigration judge.
In an Aug. 29 opinion, Cobb ruled that the Trump administration’s plan to quickly deportillegal immigrantswho had lived in the U.S. less than two years violated their right to due process.
""In defending this skimpy process, the government makes a truly startling argument: that those who entered the country illegally are entitled to no process under the Fifth Amendment,"" Cobb wrote, adding that the government could accuse ""not only noncitizens, but everyone.""
""The government could accuse you of entering unlawfully, relegate you to a bare-bones proceeding where it would ‘prove’ your unlawful entry, and then immediately remove you,"" Cobb added.
FEDERAL JUDGE BLOCKS TRUMP'S EXPANDED DEPORTATION PLAN OVER DUE PROCESS CONCERNS
Meanwhile, on the trade front, a federal appeals court said on Friday that Trump overstepped his authority by using emergency powers to impose newtariffson imported goods.
The court said that power lies squarely with Congress or within existing trade policy frameworks. Attorney GeneralPam Bondisaid the Justice Department will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, the court allowed the tariffs to remain in effect until mid-October.

The setback chips away at Trump’s trade policy, long a centerpiece of his economic agenda, which leans heavily on tariffs to raise revenue and exert pressure on foreign trading partners. Trump has previously said thattariff revenuecould offset the cost of his ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" and add hundreds of billions to the U.S. economy.

Tariff revenues rose steadily from approximately $17.4 billion in April to $23.9 billion in May, before climbing to $28 billion in June and peaking at $29.6 billion in July. According to the Treasury Department’s latest ""Customs and Certain Excise Taxes"" data, released on Aug. 28, total tariff revenues have reached $183.1 billion for the fiscal year.
At the current pace, the U.S. could collect as much tariff revenue in just four to five months as it did over the entire previous year.

As we say goodbye to the summer season by celebrating Labor Day, most Americans are eager to recognize the ingenuity and determination ofrank-and-file workers.
But not union bosses, who hijack the holiday every year to argue for more government-granted coercive powers. Instead of focusing on the workers they claim to represent, union officials wield political clout to protect and expand their privileged positions.
This is becausetoday’s unionsare built on the government-authorized ability to compel workers into their ranks. In the 24 states without right-to-work laws, union chiefs can legally extort private sector workers to ""pay up or be fired."" Even when union membership is voluntary, workers must accept the union bargaining collectively for their wages and working conditions.
NATION’S 2 LARGEST TEACHERS UNIONS FUNNELED NEARLY $50M TO LEFT-WING GROUPS, WATCHDOG REPORT SAYS
It doesn’t matter that you, as an individual employee, may not want the union’s so-called representation or a one-size-fits-all contract; union bureaucrats can forcibly take your dues money, then use it to buy political influence or advocate causes you oppose.
Workers do still have some limited rights guaranteed under federal law, such as the right to have union dues not pay for political activities (CWA v. Beck, 1988) or the right of public employees not to be forced to pay any money to a government union (Janus v. AFSCME, 2018). But, union political operatives are using their influence — bought with workers’ dues money collected under duress — to try to push through a legislative agenda that upends these rights.
For example, the Protecting the Right to Work Act (PRO Act), Big Labor’s top legislative priority in Congress, would repeal all current 26 state Right to Work laws by federal fiat. Even though Right to Work laws don’t stop a single worker from joining a union or paying dues voluntarily, they’ve made it their signature move to end this protection for good.
Why? Becauseunion bosseswant to strip rank-and-file workers of their choice. This becomes all the more obvious as you examine the PRO Act’s other provisions, which codify several suspect or downright illegal tactics union enforcers already use to get around workers’ rights.
One such tactic is the controversial ""card check"" method of organizing a union, which avoids the traditional secret ballot that lets workers have the final say. Instead, this process lets organizers submit union cards collected in person from workers, often using pressure or intimidation tactics. The AFL-CIO even admitted in its own organizing handbook that such cards don’t reflect workers’ actual wishes.
To protectexisting unionsfrom decertification (secret-ballot votes to remove an incumbent union), the PRO Act codifies another common Big Labor tactic. Through union-filed blocking charges — unproven allegations against the company of unfair practices — union officials can unilaterally block decertification votes for months or more.
In multiple cases, such tactics were used to block decertification votes from occurring even though 100% of workers signed the decertification petition. Workers can literally be unanimously opposed to the union, yet union officials can manipulate their special legal powers to trap workers against their will.
It’s the latest sign that today’s union officials have fully rejected the warnings of some early union officials who wanted to build their organizations without coercing workers into their ranks.

Take Samuel Gompers, the founder of the American Federation of Labor (now the AFL-CIO). In a 1924 speech to union delegates he forcefully rejected the coercion today’s union bosses rely on: ""I want to urge devotion to the fundamentals of human liberty — the principles of voluntarism. No lasting gain has ever come from compulsion.""
Gompers understood, as do the 8 in 10 Americans who oppose forced union dues and affiliation, that when union affiliation and financial support are voluntary, union officials must prove their worth to individual workers. But today, union bossesincreasingly reject this ideal, and undermine the liberty of those they claim to ""represent.""

So this Labor Day, remember that truly being ""pro-worker"" means rejecting the propaganda from union bosses and respecting a worker’s right to choose whether they want to join a union.
After all, it’s Labor Day, not Union Day.

For the last 250 years, ourblue-collar men and womenhave laid the foundations of our country. They’ve paved roads, built bridges and raised the skyscrapers that shape our landscape. Their tireless efforts continue to drive progress and prosperity.
This Labor Day, we celebrate theAmerican workerswho took a vast expanse of new frontier and carved a path for communities and industries to thrive. For two and a half centuries, these laborers have sustained our businesses and maintained the very basis of our success: the family.
As a mom of twin girls and a new grandmother, I understand that the reason behind our 9-to-5 is the people we gather with around the kitchen table. Our wage earners aren’t just punching the clock to stay busy. Their work has a purpose: supporting the next generation.

That’s why we applaud the work ethic and pride that the American worker applies to their job, because they’re not just growing the economy – they are proving the American Dream is alive and well for future generations.
TRUMP’S ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ COULD CEMENT ECONOMIC LEGACY FOR DECADES
At the Department of Labor, we are going to keep our foot on the gas, accelerating into the Golden Age of America. Prosperity is on the horizon, with real median weekly earnings at their highest level since the last time PresidentDonald Trumpwas in office.
We are doing what it takes to ensure that as new, mortgage-paying jobs are being created, skilled workers are ready and able to fill them. Putting native-born workers first in that effort, we’ve already witnessed an increase in native-born employment by 2,462,000 since January.
To keep driving this progress, President Trump tasked the Labor Department with a mission to Make America Skilled Again. That’s the drum I’m going to keep beating. It will require time and effort, but it’s going to yield dividends for our workers and their families.
As we create new opportunities for theAmerican worker, I’ve been on the ground, talking to folks around the country whose lives inform our policies. I’m finding out what they need at the federal level and how we can best serve them in Washington.
ARE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S TARIFFS ACTUALLY WORKING?
I’m over halfway through my 50-state America at Work tour, and a recurring theme has been workforce readiness – ensuring our labor force is prepared and trained for the challenges of tomorrow. From decades of political neglect, the American worker was placed on the back burner and their best interests were ignored.
Now, the Trump administration is turning that around, placing our workers at the pinnacle of oureconomic vision. We’re reigniting the Made in America spirit that defined the founding of our country.
At a little over 200 days into President Trump’s incredible second term, we’ve seen the economy rapidly responding to better trade deals and sound labor policy – especially in the private sector. There has been more than $8 trillion in domestic investments, which led to half a million private sector jobs being created since Inauguration Day.
Blue-collar wages have also increased 1.4% over last year – the second-fastest increase for the start of a new term on record. Even better, instead of inflation outpacing wages, as it did underPresident Joe Bidenfor 26 straight months, real wages have increased every single month since President Trump returned to office.
TRUMP'S MAJOR TRADE WINS COULD BE ROCKET FUEL TO US ECONOMY
And we’re just getting started.
With this expectation-shattering job and wage growth, I’m teaming up with my colleagues across the administration to keep the red-hot economy going strong. The Departments ofLabor, Commerce and Educationjoined together to create a five-pillar plan called America’s Talent Strategy. This comprehensive strategy will help us expand access to good-paying jobs, build skilled talent pipelines for critical industries, equip the workforce with artificial intelligence skills, and reposition the U.S. as the global economic leader.
To bring further relief to hardworking families, I’m determined to get heavy-handed government out of their pockets. At the Department of Labor, we announced a historic 63 deregulatory actions to do just that. We’re slashing red tape and making it easier for workers to keep more of their hard-earned money.
My team also announced $30 million in grant opportunities through the Industry-Driven Skills Training Fund. This money is going to accelerate workforce innovation and address critical labor needs across the country, giving a financial boost right to the people who need it.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL UNLEASH PARALLEL PROSPERITY
What’s more, our future will not be forged in the halls of woke universities, but by the grit of skilled workers, so I’m coordinating with the Department of Education and working with states to expose even more students to the trades and provide a springboard into the workforce that doesn’t rely on a traditional four-year degree. Trade school enrollment has already reached the highest level ever recorded, and we’re going to make sure it keeps going up.
In keeping with these goals, the president signed his One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, expanding Pell Grants to students pursuing technical education and skills training. Not only is this law of the land going to unlock even more opportunities for future tradesmen and women, but it will also add thousands of dollars to every single worker’s paycheck through historic tax cuts.
Between the unlocked Pell Grant opportunities and the president’s directive to recruit more apprentices, it’s crystal clear – we’re on our way to creating one million new active apprenticeships nationwide. Since January alone, the Department of Labor recorded 1,736 new registered apprenticeship programs launched nationally and over 183,000 new apprentices.

On this Labor Day, and every day, we recognize the impact of our apprentices, tradesmen, blue collar workers and small business owners. And there’s plenty to look forward to as the Department of Labor launches our officialcelebration of the 250th birthdayof our great nation.
With President Trump leading the way as the most pro-worker president in generations, labor will remain at the forefront of our America First agenda. Thanks to our negotiator-in-chief, the future is looking brighter and brighter for the American worker.

For more than 140 years,Labor Dayhas been a time to honor the contributions, achievements and sacrifices of workers in America. But this year, in the wake of growing economic inequality and a government increasingly catering to billionaires and special interests, Labor Day needs to be more than a long holiday weekend. It must be the impetus of a battle cry for workers everywhere to rise up, realize their collective strength and take their power back.
Hedge fund managers and tech moguls did not build this country or the American middle class. It was technicians, engineers, installers, teachers, caregivers, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, ironworkers, painters, laborers, operators, mechanics, drivers, farmworkers, clerks, grocers and so many others.
They went to work each day – often invisible and without fair pay, benefits, or even basic dignity. They risked their jobs, their safety and sometimes their lives tosecure better working conditionswe all enjoy today, like an eight-hour workday, overtime pay and the right to organize.

I’ve spent my career enforcing labor law and fighting to protect workers’ rights. I’ve seen how powerful working people can be when they come together. The bosses and billionaires see it, too – and it terrifies them. That’s why they’re working hard in Washington to rig the system, spending millions to weaken worker protections and make it harder for workers to exercise their rights to unionize, collectively bargain and mobilize to improve their working conditions, and to enjoy their freedoms of speech, assembly, association and expression.
ARE YOU BETTER OFF SINCE DONALD TRUMP TOOK OFFICE?
Today, we’re living through one of the largest transfers of wealth in modern history. Working people andfamilies juggle multiple jobswhile corporations pop champagne over record profits and billionaires buy second yachts. Recent estimates show the Republican budget bill will only deepen this disparity, by taking away Medicaid and SNAP assistance from millions of Americans to pay for tax cuts for the super wealthy that they really don’t need and didn’t earn. They’re profiting off the backs of so many hard-working people.
This is not an accident. It’s the direct result of a system where corporations and their donors have an outsized voice and direct influence on our democracy – and politicians showering them with loopholes and special treatment. For example, President Donald Trump’s Labor Department recently announced they were rolling back 60 workplace regulations, putting workers at greater risk of being hurt while making it easier for employers to get away with it.
Similarly, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) remains without a quorum, rendering it impossible to issue rulings or make decisions that hold corporations accountable for breaking the law. My fear is that, if this continues, we’ll find ourselves living in an environment reflective of what it was like before 1935’s National Labor Relations Act: lower wages, substandard working conditions and no real channels for workers to fight back.
DON'T BE FOOLED. MAMDANI ISN'T THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THESE TWO PATRIOTIC WOMEN ARE
Billionaires and corporations hope this will make workers feel defeated. We can’t let that happen because the truth is – workers aren’t powerless. To the contrary, they have tremendous power.
Let’s remember our history. From the Boston Tea Party to women’s suffrage to the Civil Rights Movement to the strikes at the turn of the 20th century, workers have always been a catalyst for change. Protests, boycotts, picketing, strikes, sit-ins, non-cooperation – these have never been signs of violence or dysfunction. They’reexpressions of democracy.
Our present moment in history is no different – and workers must realize they have tools to begin reclaiming this country and their power to demand changes to the way they’re governed and how they live their lives.
WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT OF BILLIONAIRES, BY BILLIONAIRES AND FOR BILLIONAIRES
Support for unions has skyrocketed to its highest point in generations, especially among young people. They’re organizing at coffee shops, warehouses, grocery stores, newspapers, universities, airlines, hospitals, tech campuses and many other locations because they realize the power they hold through standing together and bargaining collectively.
They’re rightfully demanding more than just survival – they’re demanding respect. They’re standing strong in the face of union-busting campaigns, retaliatory firings and illegal threats because they know what’s at stake – not just for themselves, but for their families and their communities. There’s strength in numbers.
That’s what gives me hope because collective power is stronger than individual power. We’re seeing agroundswell of organizingin places once thought impossible to organize, especially when people feel their elected representatives aren’t listening to them. This creates enormous opportunities for unions, advocates and allies to rally around workers, listen to their challenges, and build grassroots momentum to help workers obtain a more level playing field and safer, more just and inclusive workplaces.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
In my experience, billionaires and corporations don’t provide workers with a fair and equitable workplace through an act of goodwill. They will provide it, however, when workers demand it loudly, boldly, and persistently and show their collective power. This means withholding labor, engaging in non-cooperation, organizing sit-ins and taking other forms of collective action. It’s time for workers to use this power to protest about injustices and inequities, to make sure laws are fully enforced, and to vote out elected officials for not representing their interests.
Labor Day was bornout of strikes and marches from those who came before us. It exists because workers refused to be taken advantage of and exploited. That legacy is now in our hands – to honor, not just with celebration, but with resolve and action. Workers must never forget the power they have to fight together for the dignity, security and respect they’re entitled to and so richly deserve.

The Trump administration has ordered a nationwide review of public housing in an effort to root out residents who are in the country illegally, according to Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner.
Turner wrote that eachpublic housing authorityhas 30 days to conduct an audit to ensure that the existing orders are enforced. The department is asking for information about the public housing units and verifiable citizenship or ""eligible immigration status.""
""No longer will illegal aliens be able to leave citizenship boxes blank or take advantage of HUD-funded housing, riding the coattails of hardworking American citizens,"" Turner wrote.

""Currently, HUD only serves one out of four eligible families due, in part, to the lack of enforcement of prohibition against federally funded assistance to illegal aliens,"" he continued.
If a program does not comply with the request, it could risk ""examination"" of its ownfederal funding.
Turner told Fox News Channel's Charles Hurt on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" Friday that the DC Housing Authority was the first to be placed on notice, but over 3,000 other PHAs are being told the same requirements nationwide, stressing that ""American citizens will be prioritized.""

https://www.foxnews.com/media/former-obama-official-freaks-out-california-democrat-over-her-record-amid-housing-crisis-debate,Former Obama official freaks out at California Democrat over her record amid housing crisis debate,"Former Obama official Jon Lovett railed at a California councilwoman over her record amid a n debate about how California should address its housing affordability crisis driving people to other states.
Former Obama speechwriter Jon Lovett sparred with a Los Angeles city councilmember on Wednesday during a heated debate on California’s housing crisis.
California Democratic state Sen. Scott Wiener and Los Angeles Councilmember Imelda Padilla debated on the ""Pod Save America"" podcast about how California should handle its ongoing housing crisis. Wiener’s Abundant & Affordable Homes Near Transit Act, SB 79,according to his press release,""tackles the root causes of California’s affordability crisis by allowing more homes to be built near major public transportation stops and on land owned by transit agencies, bolstering transit use, slashing climate emissions, and supporting public transportation in the process.""
Opponents of such legislation argue that introducing large amounts of affordable housing threatens to irreversibly change the character of their local neighborhoods.Padilla said on the podcastthat a top responsibility of a council member is making land-use decisions that greatly impact the lives of constituents.
""People get elected for the conversations that they have with folks about what they're going to do to keep their neighborhood looking and growing the way that they want it to be,"" she said.

She added, ""So, for example, for the state to say, ‘Here's your opportunity to build something that is potentially seven stories high when nothing around it is seven stories because the state allows it,’ it's almost an insult to everyone who voted for the individual who they believe is going to help grow and clean and maintain their communities as they would like them to be.""
""But see, that to me gets to the core of the issue,"" Lovett responded.
""I really want to be fair to your point of view,"" he continued. ""But what I hear there, is what you're saying is, ‘Well, there weren't seven-story buildings here in the past, so there can't be seven-story buildings here in the future.' But that freezes California in a moment when there were far fewer people in this state. And my concern in what I'm hearing from you is there are legitimate issues that you're raising about what locals feel about the character of their neighborhood. I'm not saying that those aren't legitimate concerns, but it seems to lose the forest for the trees, which is we have an emergency.""
He noted the phenomenon ofCalifornians fleeing to Texasas people criticize California’s lack of new housing for the rising population.

Padilla noted that she has worked to negotiate a new building that would be three stories rather than six stories, one that would be a compromise between locals who want no development versus those who want more housing. She argued the compromise, designed to look better, would be preferable to a ""big ugly cement box in the middle of the neighborhood"" that would maximize density at all costs.
""Do you really think that all these young people that are seeking the Hollywood jobs that want to come to Los Angeles, want to live in a cement-looking building and find it to be dignified?"" she asked. ""I don't think so. But SB79 creates a situation where the developer can actually do that.""
Lovett turned to Wiener and asked, ""Is there a part of this where people just need to accept that if we're going to build the amount of housing we need in the speed that we need it, some of these concerns can't be addressed? That we just got to move fast and not everybody's going to like it?""
Wiener acknowledged that no plan will equally satisfy everyone, but he argued the bill will allow cities to preserve their own design standards.

Right now, many people are worried that artificial intelligence (AI) is coming for their jobs. If you're one of them, then therecent study by Microsoftwill shed some light on how AI's generative capabilities will impact your field of work. In short, some occupations are more susceptible to its influence than others.
This study is making waves because, unlike previous studies, it draws insight from real-world data. Microsoft looked at 200,000 anonymous Copilot conversations from 2024 and mapped them against the U.S. government's job classification system.
The study also identified entire occupational groups, like ""computer and mathematical occupations"" and ""office and administrative support,"" among those with the highest AI overlap. The results reveal exactly which careers AI is already touching and which ones it barely affects.

A man walking to his job in a financial district. Positions like advertising sales agents and market research analysts face the greatest likelihood of AI integration, according to a recent Microsoft study.(Ivan Alvarado)
The result of the study was the calculation of an ""AI applicability score."" It measures how closely certain job activities align with the capabilities of AI. To no one's surprise, knowledge-based and communication-heavy roles were at the top of thelist of jobsthat are most impacted. At the bottom of this list were jobs requiring physical labor or machine operation, showing minimal overlap.
This score reflects overlap, not guaranteed job loss. The researchers stressed that no occupation is fully performed by AI. The study focuses only on language-based generative AI (like Copilot), not other AI areas such as robotics or autonomous systems, which could affect different roles.

The researchers emphasized that it's important to differentiate between overlap and replacement. Overlap means theAI performscertain tasks alongside humans, while replacement means it will take their place. The study makes no predictions about job growth or losses. It's simply a snapshot of where AI fits in today. In fact, historical trends suggest that automation can sometimes add jobs instead of taking them away. So, it's not all gloom and doom even in sectors with high overlap.

WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO KEEP AI FROM BECOMING A FAR-LEFT TROJAN HORSE
If your job appears in the ""most impacted"" list, it doesn't mean you need to panic or start packing up your desk. It means AI is already capable of handling parts of your daily tasks — and that can be an opportunity if you learn to use it. Those who embrace AI tools now can work faster, free up time for creative thinking, and make themselves even more valuable.
If your role is on the ""least impacted"" list, don't assume you're immune forever. While physical and hands-on jobs have less overlap with AI today,future technologiesbeyond language models, like robotics or AI-driven machinery, could change that picture. Staying adaptable, learning basic AI skills, and keeping up with tech trends will help you stay ahead no matter your industry.
In short, treat this study as a career weather forecast, not a doomsday prediction. AI might not replace you, but someone who knows how to work with AI could. The smartest move? Learn to be that person.

As of now, it seems there are no predictions of mass unemployment due to the rise of AI. However, the study does highlight that impacted areas may evolve. A good example is how bank tellers still exist even though we have ATMs. They just redefined the role of tellers, and this is what will happen with generative AI in various fields. And who knows?

Rod Blagojevich rails against Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson for refusing to work with ICE on 'The Ingraham Angle.'
A Chicago Teamsters local is demanding a packaging company refuse to allow federal immigration enforcement on its property without warrants as a top tenet of its overall demands.
The workers are seeking assurances from Mauser Packaging Solutions that it will require ICE to display a warrant signed by a judge before it is allowed on the property.
The strike at Mauser's plant in the heavily Hispanic ""Little Village"" neighborhood has lasted more than two months, and the Teamsters Local 705 negotiator recently refused the factory’s latest offer, according to multiple reports.
About 140 people work at the plant, which reconditions metal barrels for chemical storage, and a plurality are Latino, according to theAmerican Prospect.

One striking worker told the outlet that he and others are concerned that ICE may target them on a racial basis even if they are able to prove legal residency.
The Prospect reported the strike began over a separate issue — allegations of employee surveillance during discussions with union representatives amid contract bargaining.
The Illinois-based global company’s striking workers also collected a big-name voice in their court during that time: Chicago MayorBrandon Johnson.
Johnson, a former teachers' union figure, is familiar with similar situations and also agreed with the union's aversion to federal law enforcement.

""This union and this strike is leading the way to ensure that this country knows that workers run this country,"" Johnson said while rallying with strikers earlier this month.
He said Mauser’s workers have the right to seek livable wages and environs ""at a time in which we have a federal government coming after workers, immigrants, Brown and Black people,"" according to theChicago Sun-Times.
Johnson demanded workers get protections to ensure ""ICE agents do notget to run amok [or] create fear and come in and disrupt and destabilize our communities and workplaces, whether you are at work, school, church or the barbershop.""
He noted thatChicago is a ""welcoming city,""a term increasing in popularity among Democratic leaders due to the political stigma now associated with ""sanctuary cities.""

Mauser Packaging Solutions communications director Kimberly Braam told Fox News Digital later Wednesday the company ""is aware of the concerns raised by members of Teamsters Local 705. We are committed to negotiating a fair and sustainable collective agreement with employees.""
When asked about the union’s demands, a DHS spokesperson criticized Johnson, saying he and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker ""stand with criminal illegal aliens over the safety of American citizens.""
The spokesperson also said ""shameful rhetoric"" against ICE has ""fueled a culture of hate against law enforcement resulting in a 1,000 percent increase in assaults against them.""

While it is still uncertain whether PresidentDonald Trump's dismissal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, who is preparing a legal challenge, will succeed, her potential departure gives him another chance to install a nominee more attuned to his monetary priorities.
TheFederal ReserveBoard of Governors, commonly known as the Fed board, is composed of seven members, or governors, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

When asked about replacing Cook, Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday that he has some ""very good people for that position.""
""We’ll have a majority very shortly,"" Trump said. ""So that’ll be great.""
Tensions between Trump and the Federal Reserve over monetary policy have intensified in recent months. Trump has placed the blame squarely on Powell for not lowering the federal funds target rate, which he says could save the nation ""hundreds of billions of dollars.""

Cook's ascension marked a historic first, as she became the first Black woman to serve as a governor on the Fed board. Now, her potential removal from that same role could mark another historic first.
As it stands, Trump says Cook is fired, effective immediately. But Cook and her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argue that Trump has no legal authority to remove her. Her term on the Fed board runs until January 2038.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/what-fed-must-do-now-after-jerome-powells-jackson-hole-epiphany,What Fed must do now after Jerome Powell's Jackson Hole epiphany,"The Fed Chief signals rate cuts are coming.
Last Friday in Jackson Hole,Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powellfinally – and grudgingly – admitted what the Trump team has been saying all along: tariffs don’t fuel inflation.
At most, tariffs create a one-time adjustment in prices, not the kind of runaway spiral that demands punishing rate hikes. And even that one-time bump may be negligible if, as we have long argued, foreign exporters – not American consumers – shoulder most or all of the burden.
The implication is clear: whether the impact is zero or merely a one-time step-up in prices, there is absolutelyno justification for the Fedto hide behind ""tariff uncertainty"" as an excuse for overly restrictive interest-rate policy.

This really is a historic epiphany from a Fed chair who has long misunderstood the power of Trumpnomics – the four beautiful horsemen of economic growth and price stability: tax cuts, deregulation, strategic energy dominance and fair trade.
THE FED’S FOOLISH INTEREST RATE POLICY IS STOPPING AMERICA’S ECONOMY FROM BOOMING
Trumpnomics deliveredboth strong economic growth and price stability in the first term. It is delivering again in the second.
Markets immediately recognized the punch of Powell’s tariff epiphany. The Dow smashed through its 45,000 ceiling – and I remain on record predicting a march to 50,000. Yields on the 10- and 30-year Treasuries tumbled, driving bond prices sharply higher.
Clearly, Wall Street got Powell’s dovish tariff message: the door to a September rate cut is now wide open. The only suspense is whether Powell will nibble with 25 basis points – or cut far more boldly.
But here’s the lingering fear, from the West Wing to Wall Street: While Powell may now grasp that tariffs don’t fuelpersistent inflation, he still doesn’t understand who pays.
GOOD ECONOMIC DATA IS BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP’S INTEREST RATE PUSH
Memo to Jay: Every one of America’s major trading partners – the same countries driving our $1 trillion annual trade deficit – is deeply dependent on access to the U.S. market. When Trump slaps on tariffs, it is their exporters, not our consumers, who shoulder the burden. Without U.S. demand, their economies falter – so pay the tariff piper our trading partners must.
That’s why in Trump’s first term, despite all the handwringing from the ""Panicans"" about looming inflation, tariffs on everything from steel and aluminum to China produced the opposite: robust growth with price stability.
If Powell clings to timidity and keeps rates overly restrictive, he will continue inflicting enormous harm on the U.S. economy. American families are already being crushed by the world’s highest mortgage rates, small businesses can’t get affordable credit, and exporters face a dollar so overvalued it prices them out ofglobal markets.
Global rate spreads underscore just how out of touch the Fed is with the rest of the world. The European Central Bank’s deposit facility sits at 2%. The Bank of Japan holds near 0.5%. China runs its seven-day repo at 1.4%. Against that backdrop, the Fed’s 4.25%–4.50% target range remains a glaring outlier – more than 200 basis points above Europe, nearly 400 above Japan, and triple China.
LEFT'S TARIFF DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS FALL FLAT AS TRUMP'S AMERICA THRIVES
The result: the U.S. economy combines the world’s highest policy rates and mortgage rates with the world’s strongest currency – a triple hit to American exporters.
On the home front, the Powell squeeze is just as punishing. Average 30-year fixed mortgage rates remain stuck in the 6–7% range, double pre-pandemic levels. That locks millions of young families out of the housing market and stalls residential construction — historically one of the most powerful engines ofU.S. recoveries.
Small businesses, reliant on bank credit rather than Wall Street bond markets, face double-digit loan rates that suffocate job creation. Consumers pay more on everything from credit cards to auto loans.

And for what? Disinflation is already here. Headline CPI is back near 3% year-on-year. The Fed’s preferred PCE measure runs closer to 2.5% – essentially on target. Energy prices are subdued, supply chains have healed, and wage pressures are stabilizing. Yet U.S. real (inflation-adjusted) rates now stand higher than at any point in nearly two decades–a textbook case of over-tightening.
Powell defends this stance by claiming the Fed must ""anchor inflation expectations."" He has clutched his pearls over the mirage of tariff-driven inflation, even as history shows those fears are overblown.
Powell’s Jackson Hole admission – that tariffs create, at most, a one-time price adjustment – was an epiphany long in coming.  The question now is whether Powell will act on that epiphany.

A token 25-basis-point trim in September would not cut it. To realign America with its global peers, to relieve pressure on families and farmers, and to restore competitiveness toU.S. exporters, the Fed must move decisively with an up to a 100 basis point cut.
It’s time for the Federal Reserve to stop mistaking tight money for prudence. Keeping U.S. rates far above the rest of the world is not a sign of strength. It is a policy mistake – one that strangles American growth and hands our competitors the advantage.

""She seems to have had an infraction and she can't have an infraction. And especially that infraction because she's in charge of, if you think about it, mortgages.

The Federal Reserve acknowledged Cook's potential legal action and said in a statement that the U.S. central bank will ""abide by any court decision.""
""Lisa Cook has indicated through her personal attorney that she will promptly challenge this action in court and seek a judicial decision that would confirm her ability to continue to fulfill her responsibilities as a Senate-confirmed member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,"" a Federal Reserve spokesperson wrote in a statement to Fox News Digital.

A LOOK AT THE UNFOLDING BATTLE BETWEEN TRUMP AND POWELL OVER FED POLICY
Cook’s potential removal from the Fed Board leaves a seat open on the panel that guides the nation's monetary policy. This gives Trump another opportunity to name someone closely aligned with his financial policy to the Fed.
When asked about replacing Cook on the Fed Board, Trump told reporters at the White House that he has some ""very good people for that position.""

Trump accused Cook — who was appointed by former PresidentJoe Bidenin 2022 and is the first Black woman to serve on the Fed’s Board of Governors — of mortgage fraud on Monday evening. Cook has denied any wrongdoing.
The allegations stem from Bill Pulte,a Trump appointeeto an agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pulte accused Cook of claiming two primary residences, one in Ann Arbor and another in Atlanta in 2021, with the goal of getting better mortgage terms.
'SOME AUTHORITARIAN S***:' DEMS RIP TRUMP'S UNPRECEDENTED FIRING OF FED GOVERNOR LISA COOK
On Aug. 15, Pulte sent the Justice Department a criminal referral regarding Cook in which he accused her of falsifying bank documents and property records.
As it stands, Trump says Cook is fired, effective immediately. But Cook and her lawyer, Abbe Lowell, argue that he has no legal authority to remove her. Her term on the Fed Board runs until January 2038.

(Credit: APTN)
ASan Franciscolawyer says a landlord has the right to only allow ""MAGA voters and Israel supporters"" to attend an open house.
""From the tenant perspective, there isn't a violation here of California or federal law because political orientation is not a protected class,"" Joseph Tobener, apartner at Tobener Ravenscroftand tenant rights lawyer, told Fox News Digital on Thursday.
""So things that it might touch upon that are protected class would be ethnicity, source of income, religion,"" he added. ""So there's some things that skirts around, but the words were such that they are all political orientation, which isn't a protected class and not a violation of the Fair Employment and Housing Act in California. Now, with that said, I think what rubs people the wrong way is that we have a new housing shortage in San Francisco because of the AI boom.""

The San Francisco Standard reportedTuesday that Alexander Baran, 48, owns a two-bedroom apartment in Sunnyside and had listed it on Zillow, which has since been taken down.
The listing, which went up Aug. 5 and was removed on Sunday, allegedly said that ""OnlyMAGA votersand Israel supporters are invited"" to the open house.
When the San Francisco Standard went to visit Baran to speak to him about the listing, he allegedly said, ""Get the f--- away from here. Don’t make me repeat myself.""
Tobener, the tenant rights lawyer, said that the City by the Bay is ""about a month into a major housing crisis where people are lining up 20 deep for a unit to try and get one unit or showing up and the unit's already rented.""

The concern that people have, he said, is landlords rejecting people that need housing due to their political views.
""Landlords have a lot of power right now. And so I think that's the concern from the tenant perspective,"" Tobener said. ""Everybody should get a fair shake regardless of their political orientation. Everyone should be able to get access to housing. Housing is a fundamental right. Everyone needs housing. Everyone needs a roof over their heads. And so are we gonna start down this road where only certain people from certain political leanings can get access to certain housing.""
To change the law and make political affiliation a protected class, Tobener said that the California state legislature would have to add political affiliations to the Fair Employment and Housing Act as a protected category.
That move, he said, would certainly be challenged and likely end up in the Supreme Court.
""I've been doing tenant rights law for 30 years and this will be the third tech boom in San Francisco, and it's a boom and bust city. It always has been since the Gold Rush and what we have right now is this major AI boom with a lot of people wanting to come work here,"" Tobener said.

According to theZumper National Rent Report,""San Francisco led the nation in annual rent growth, with one-bedroom rent up 13.3% and two-bedrooms surging 16.3%.""
""First it was the dot-com boom, then it was a social media boom, and now it's the AI boom, and you're getting this circumstance where landlords have a lot of power,"" Tobener added. ""There are a lot of people clamoring for one unit and, you know, we want to make sure that landlords don't, you know, step across the line. And housing is accessible to everyone regardless of, you know, what they think about the political climate.""

Amid a trend of declining membership since theSupreme Courtstruck down mandatory union dues, the nation’s two largest teachers’ unions have poured tens of millions into left-wing causes, a new report from a conservative watchdog group finds.
The national nonprofit group, Defending Ed, released areportthis week after combing through the National Education Association and American Federation of Teachers' contributions to left-wing and far-left groups. The nonprofit found that the two unions spent a combined $43.5 million since 2022 to help fund state and federal political action committees and other ideologically left-wing entities, such as D.C. think tanks.
""It is clear that the teachers unions’ priorities are advancing far-left politics and radical social justice issues, not the education of children,"" Defending Ed researcher Rhyen Staley told Fox News Digital. ""This is a slap in the face to families and teachers who want to focus on helping students improve their reading and math skills. It is time that Congress acts to stop this obscene redistribution of public monies to advance left-wing identity politics.""

Left-wing philanthropic behemoths like the Tides Network, New Venture Fund, Sixteen-Thirty Fund and Future Forward, the last of which was the main Super PAC supporting Kamla Harris' 2024 presidential run after former PresidentJoe Bidendropped out, all received a combined nearly $1.5 million from the unions, according to the report.
The unions also forked over significant amounts of cash for groups that focus on supportingleft-wing candidatesfor public office, such as the Democratic Governors Association, Democrat's House Majority and Senate Majority PACs.
Other groups they have donated to include major left-wing think tanks like the Center for American Progress and its 501(c)(4) arm, which received close to a million dollars since 2022 from the two unions.

""You’d think in light of the decline in union membership in recent years, that they’d start providing value to members that outweighs the cost of membership,"" Withe told Fox News Digital. ""Instead, they are appeasing the radical base of union members by advocating for men in women’s sports, transitioning minors, antisemitism and other radical ideological stances.""
He added that this is just ""the tip of the iceberg"" too ""when you consider that there are thousands of statewide and city and county teachers unions that are mostly funding the same causes.""

While at UW–Eau Claire, I was honored to be appointed by Vice Chancellor Diaz as a DEI Program Director to expand data-informed academic interventions that improved retention and graduation rates among students of color.""
She added that, ""Despite facing unlawful discrimination in that DEI role as a White woman, I remain steadfast in my belief that high-quality, accessible education — grounded in data and responsive to a changing workforce — is essential for all learners. I believe deeply in leading and teaching with integrity and in choosing the harder right over the easier wrong. My commitment to student-centered learning and academic excellence remains as strong as ever.""
Fox, Hoffman's lawyer, told Fox News Digital, ""We did not bring this case based on opposition to the university's programs. This suit was brought because UW-Eau Claire had taken actions that unlawfully discriminated against an employee who championed those programs with substantial success. Such actions can undermine the credibility of the programs the University seeks to promote.""

https://www.foxnews.com/us/exclusive-marine-corps-wife-mom-blasts-blue-state-wrongful-levy-savings-left-with-pennies,"EXCLUSIVE: Marine Corps wife, mom blasts blue state for wrongful levy on savings: ‘Left us with pennies’","Sarah Ogasian, wife of USMC Master Sgt. Jon Ogasian, speaks to Fox News Digital about her claim that the state of New York was in violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act after taking all of their family savings in error.
EXCLUSIVE:Sarah Ogasian, aMarine Corpsspouse, mother and ER nurse, remembers the exact moment her husband, Master Sgt. Jon Ogasian, discovered their savings account had been wiped out.
The couple lived in Highland, New York, while Jon was stationed at Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, before moving to Texas, where he is currently at Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth.
""[Jon] said that he woke up, went to work at the military base, opened up his cellphone and looked on his app, checking our bank accounts, and that it was completely drained,"" Sarah Ogasian said in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""There was absolutely no money left in our bank account, and he just literally wanted to just vomit. … As soon as the money was gone, it literally left us with pennies.""
The Ogasians were told by a representative from the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance that their money had been seized by the state through a tax levy.

Although New Yorkhas since admitted the levy was in error and canceled the assessment, the Ogasians say they are still waiting for their funds to be returned and are being told that ""a processing fee is being taken out to get the check back.""
""If this is happening to us, then who else has this happened to? Who else has wrongfully gotten money taken out of their account?"" Ogasian said.
The Ogasian's case raises questions about whether state tax systems are failing to properly apply federal protections under theServicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)and the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act (MSRRA).
The SCRA is a federal law that shields active-duty service members from certain state taxes, liens and financial actions when their legal residence is elsewhere. In practice, it means that a Marine stationed in New York cannot be taxed by the state on his military income if his domicile is legally New Hampshire, which does not have an income tax.

The Military Spouses Residency Relief Act also extends that same protection tomilitary spouses, allowing them to claim the servicemember’s home state for tax purposes even if they work in the stationed state.Capital One, the family’s bank, told Fox News Digital it had complied with all applicable laws and stressed its commitment to honoring the SCRA, though the company declined to discuss the Ogasians’ account specifically.
""Capital One is committed to both the letter and spirit of the SCRA. This includes the provision of benefits and protections above and beyond what is required under the SCRA in certain situations that involve a Capital One loan or liability,"" a Capital One spokesperson said. ""Further, we also comply with any applicable federal or state laws concerning levy orders.""
New York flagged the family because they had a state mailing address, but weren’t paying state taxes. Yet Jon’s W-2s and military records clearly listed New Hampshire as his legal domicile, making him exempt under federal law.
According to Sarah Ogasian, her Marine husband's W-2s and military records clearly listed New Hampshire as his legal domicile.(iStock)
When the Ogasians called,Sarah saidthey were shocked to find state officials weren't familiar with the SCRA protections.
""The New York tax rep had no idea what the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act even was. My husband had to explain it to him, which I don’t think is his position,"" she said. ""He shouldn’t have had to explain that to a tax representative.""
According to Sarah, without access to their savings, her family has been unable to buy back-to-school clothes, repair their broken van, or pay for their children’s sports and dance activities.
""We were starting school here in Texas. We start in the first two weeks of August. We had to sit our kids down and say, ‘listen, we don’t have any money right now,’"" she said. ""There’s literally no money to be had. We can’t afford school clothes, we can’t afford new backpacks, we can’t afford new shoes. We had to really limit what we got… for the first time in our lives we just had to go out to like secondhand stores and get new clothes that way.""

Sarah points to the years of service and sacrifice their family has given. She worked on the front lines as an ER nurse during theCOVID-19 pandemic, while Jon has served 21 years in the Marines, including deployments overseas.
""Back when COVID hit during the pandemic, I was working the front lines in upstate New York. I was the one there watching people die and holding their hands while their loved ones were not there. We were deemed as such heroes back then,"" she said. ""And now, New York state couldn't care less about what I’ve done for New York state, never mind my husband, who has served 21 years of his life.""
Fox News Digital reached out to New York Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office and the state Office of the Taxpayer Rights Advocate, but had not received responses at the time of publication.House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik also weighed in to Fox News Digital, blasting the state’s handling of the case.""The reckless and incompetent Hochul Administration violated federal law under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act with gross government overreach by levying [an entire savings account] from a military family without their knowledge.
Despite this error, the Hochul Administration is brazen enough to still charge a processing fee to the family just to get their money back. I call upon Governor Hochul and New York State to rectify this error immediately and to drop the fee charged against the family. This egregious overreach is another example of the Hochul Administration attempting to exact huge tolls on New York families to pay for New York State’s bloated and mismanaged budget,"" Stefanik said.
For now, the Ogasians are left waiting, watching their hard-earned savings remain in limbo.

""People keep telling me ‘sue the state, sue the state.’ And I said, ‘no, I don’t want their money. I just want my money back. The savings we worked hard for are being held hostage from us,'"" said Sarah, who offered advice to other military families. ""Keep your records. That is the biggest thing as a military family. But also know your rights. Know what the SCRA is. I didn’t know what it was prior to that… stick to your guns.
""When you know that you’ve been wronged, go for it.""

Tariff revenues rose steadily from approximately $17.4 billion in April to $23.9 billion in May, before climbing to $28 billion in June and peaking to a cool $29.6 billion in July. At the current pace, the U.S. could collect as much tariff revenue in just four to five months as it did over the entire previous year.

On Tuesday, Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentsaid he anticipates revising this year’s tariff revenue estimate above the previous $300 billion projection. While he did not offer a new forecast, he emphasized the total would be ""substantially"" higher.

The nation's debt, which is the amount of money the U.S. owes its creditors, is nearing$37.2 trillionas of Aug. 20, according to the Treasury Department. The staggering figure has intensified the long-standing debate in Washington over government spending, taxation and efforts to rein in the ballooning deficit.
""I think that we're going to bring down the deficit-to-GDP, we will start paying down debt, and then at a point that can be used as an offset for the American people,"" he said of the tariff revenues.

The Department ofHousing and Urban Development(HUD) is moving to make English the sole language used for all agency business, Secretary Scott Turner said Tuesday.
The move is in line with President Donald Trump's executive order in March to make English the official language of the United States.
""Following @POTUS’ Executive Order Designating English as the Official Language of The United States, HUD will solely use English for all Departmental business and services,"" Turner wrote Tuesday on X. ""We are one people, united, and we will speak with one voice and one language to deliver on our mission.""

Fox News Digital has reached out to HUD.
In a memo sent out Monday, HUD deputy secretary Andrew Hughes advised department leadership of the changes, theNew York Postreported.
""We are one people, united, and we will speak with one voice and one language to deliver on our mission of expanding housing that is affordable, helping those in need, caring for our most vulnerable Americans, and revitalizing rural, tribal, and urban communities,"" he wrote.
HUD previously touted that it accommodated around 222 languages and had an interpretation line for individuals unable to speak English proficiently, the Post reported.
Despite the shift, HUD will make accommodations to offer other languages required under the Americans with Disability Act and the Violence Against Women Act.

In previous years, HUD made efforts to offer services in various languages tolow-income immigrantswho weren't proficient in English.
In March, Trump issued an executive order that revoked an order issued in 2000 by former PresidentBill Clintonthat required federal agencies and recipients of federal funding to provide language assistance to non-English speakers.
Despite English being the dominant language spoken in the United States, the U.S. has never had an official language.

Chicago community leaders and longtime residents say the Obama Presidential Center risks washing away the neighborhood’s fabric, warning that proposed luxury developments tied to the project could price out families who have long called the South Side home, according to a report.
They also say the sprawling 19.3-acre site in historic Jackson Park, with its 225-foot-tall concrete museum, has become an eyesore that disrupts the natural landscape and all locals are getting in return for the unsightly structure is soaring rents and higher tax bills.
""This is a monument to one man's ego,"" Steve Cortes, a longtime Chicagoan and former advisor to President Donald Trump, told theDaily Mail. ""Look at the Reagan Library. It's beautiful. This? There are almost no windows. What are they hiding? And this Brutalist cement look in a city known for its incredible architecture.""

OBAMA LIBRARY, BEGUN WITH LOFTY DEI GOALS, NOW PLAGUED BY $40M RACIALLY CHARGED SUIT, BALLOONING COSTS
The Obama Foundation secured a 99-year lease for the public parcel for $10 in 2018 and promised to revitalize the area. Obama said at the time that the project did not intend to displace residents, adding that its overseers are trying to balance boosting jobs and economic development in the area while maintaining and protecting existing affordable housing.
Alderwoman Jeanette Taylor, who represents much of the working-class neighborhood surrounding the site, fears that locals are being priced out.
""Every time large development comes to communities, they displace the very people they say they want to improve it for. This was no different, and we’re living what is actually happening,"" Taylor told the outlet. ""We’re going to see rents go higher and we’re going to see families displaced.""
She has pushed for protections such as affordable housing requirements around the site, tenant purchase rights and rental assistance to shield residents from displacement. She won some concessions in the 2020 agreement – whereby 30% of new units on city-owned land were to be affordable – but many of her broader demands, including a full Community Benefits Agreement (CBA), were not adopted.

CHICAGO SOUTH SIDE RESIDENTS SAY THEY'RE BEING DISPLACED BY OBAMA CENTER: CAUSING 'HARM TO BLACK FAMILIES'
A CBA is a binding deal that requires developers to deliver protections such as affordable housing, local hiring or other safeguards to ensure big projects don’t push out existing residents.
""The cityof Chicagoshould have done a Community Benefits Agreement before the first shovel went into the ground, but they didn’t,"" Taylor said. ""We’re going to see small landlords having to raise the rent. Their property taxes are going up and we’re going to see development that is not inclusive to our community.""
Residents point to a proposed 250-room luxury hotel as a symbol and a driver of economic pressures far beyond the scale of existing neighborhood development. Once a major luxury project is approved, surrounding property values typically spike and so its presence signals to investors and developers that the area is shifting toward wealthier clientele and away from its historically working-class, majority-Black base.
The hotel’s approval is still under review, and residents have held demonstrations calling for its rejection. The investment firm behind the project is headed by Allison Davis, a veteran real estate developer and lawyer who was Obama’s first boss out of Harvard Law School.

TRUMP OFFERS TO HELP OBAMA WITH PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY'S 'DISASTER'
""When you got people’s rent going from $850 to $1,300 you’re telling people you don’t want them in the neighborhood,"" said Dixon Romeo, an organizer with the Obama Community Benefits Agreement Coalition, toldNBC Chicagoat a demonstration in April.
Since ground was broken, construction has progressed at a snail’s pace while costs have ballooned from an original estimate of $330 million to a 2021 foundation projection of $830 million – with no updates since then.
The center, which aims to honor formerPresident Barack Obama'spolitical career, will also consist of a digital library, conference facilities, a gymnasium and a regulation-sized NBA court. It will also house the nonprofit Obama Foundation, which is overseeing the center’s development.
The scale of the project and the aesthetics of its centerpiece library have come in for criticism.
Ken Woodward, an attorney and father of six who grew up in the area, called it a ""monstrosity."" ""It looks like this big piece of rock that just landed here out of nowhere in what used to be a really nice landscape of trees and flowers,"" Woodward told the Daily Mail.
""It’s over budget, it’s taking way too long to finish and it’s going to drive up prices and bring headaches and problems for everyone who lives here. It feels like a washing away of the neighborhood and culture that used to be here.""
Kyana Butler, an activist with Southside Together who campaigned for a CBA around the Obama Center, shared similar sentiments with the outlet.
""It’s pretty huge and monstrous,"" Butler said. ""It could have been smaller in scale and cost a lot less money. We’re all worried about the impact on the community.""
Tyrone Muhammad, director of Ex-Cons for Community and Social Change, said, ""It’s truly the Tower of Babel.""
""Property taxes are going up so much that the owner of my building is saying she might just walk away.. I don’t blame President Obama for all of this, but the people on his team may not have the best intentions for people in this area,"" Muhammed, a 2026 Illinois Senate candidate, told the outlet.
""It’s disingenuous and hypocritical to take park space away from people and then not involve them in what takes its place. The move violates common decency.""
Fox News Digital has reached out to the Obama Center for comment.
In May, PresidentDonald Trumpoffered to help out with the development of the center and linked DEI to the construction problems. The project set out ""ambitious goals"" for certain construction diversity quotas, with its contracts to be allocated to ""diverse suppliers,"" 35% of which were required to be minority-based enterprises (MBEs).

""Look, President Obama, if he wanted help, I'd give him help because I'm a really good builder and I build on time, on budget. He's building his library in Chicago. It's a disaster,"" Trump said, adding that Obama was paying for prioritizing DEI over meritocracy.
""And he wanted to be very politically correct and he didn't use good, hard, tough, mean construction workers that I love, Marco,""Trump said, while addressing Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
A $40.75 million racially charged lawsuit filed earlier this year by a minority contractor against the project’s structural engineer shined a spotlight on the DEI-driven aspect of the project. The structural engineers claimed the minority contractor lacked sufficient qualifications and experience to perform its work,resulting in delays.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tariff-uncertainty-threatens-490b-us-manufacturing-investment-report-warns,"Tariff uncertainty threatens $490B in US manufacturing investment, report warns","President Donald Trump on Monday praised the 'billions of dollars' flowing into the U.S. economy from tariffs imposed on imported goods.
FIRST ON FOX:A new report from the Joint Economic Committee Minority warned Monday that fallout from PresidentDonald Trump's trade policy could slash U.S. manufacturing investment by as much as $490 billion by 2029.
Such investments that businesses may defer because of trade uncertainty include capital expenditures on new factories, plants, and production facilities, along with research and development and purchases of advancedmanufacturingequipment.
POWERFUL MANUFACTURING ASSOCIATION PENS REGULATION REBALANCING PLAN FOR TRUMP ADMIN
The report, compiled by Democrats, cautions that delaying these kinds of investments not only slows innovation but also risks fewer factory jobs, weaker supply chains, and diminished U.S. competitiveness against global powerhouse rivals likeChina.

""Strengthening American manufacturing is critical to the future of our economy and our national security,"" said Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., ranking member of the Joint Economic Committee. ""While President Trump promised that he would expand our manufacturing sector, this report shows that, instead, the chaos and uncertainty created by his tariffs has placed a burden on American manufacturers that could weigh our country down for years to come.""
The Republican Joint Economic Committee Majority did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.
TRUMP CALLS TARIFF WINDFALL 'SO BEAUTIFUL TO SEE' AS CASH SAILS IN
The committee drew parallels between U.S. tariff ambiguity and the U.K.’s economic experience afterBrexit. Its analysis relies on long-term projections of nonresidential fixed investment from the Congressional Budget Office, released in January 2025, and Bank of England research on how prolonged trade policy confusion curbed business investment in the U.K. from 2016 to 2021.
Brexit refers to the U.K.’s 2016 decision to leave theEuropean Union, then a 28-member political and economic bloc that set common rules on trade, immigration, and regulation.

""This had long-term consequences for growth: Economists have estimated that, in the years following the Brexit vote, the U.K.’s real gross domestic product (GDP) was 4 to 8% lower than it would have otherwise been, primarily due to businesses pulling back on investment amidst high uncertainty,"" the Joint Economic Committee Minority wrote in the report.
The group calculates that a similarly prolonged period of trade instability in the U.S. could reduce manufacturing investment by 13% annually, totaling about $490 billion by 2029.

The committee adds that even if trade fears were resolved immediately, the damage already inflicted on the sector would linger. The report noted that the turmoil businesses faced in just one month — April — could still lower investment by an average of 1% annually through 2029, equal to about $42.2 billion in lost manufacturing spending.
Manufacturers are especially vulnerable to policy swings because decisions like building factories or purchasing advanced equipment require years of planning and carry significant costs that are difficult to reverse.

https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/orange-juice-sugar-cuts-proposed-fda-help-citrus-growers-what-means-you,Orange juice sugar cuts proposed by FDA to help citrus growers: What it means for you,"'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts guess dye-free foods and weigh in on Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unveiling a plan to phase out eight artificial food dyes.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing an update to a decades-old orange juice rule that could give American citrus growers a boost — with little to no change in the taste of thepopular breakfast staple,experts say.
For the first time since 1963, the agency wants to lower the minimum sugar content required in pasteurized orange juice.
The proposal, announced on Aug. 6, would drop the required Brix level — a measure of dissolved solids, mostly natural sugars — from 10.5% to 10%. The shift aligns with the natural Brix levels now present in American oranges and corresponds to about 1 gram less of sugar per 8-ounce serving, from 18 grams to 17 grams, per the FDA.
FRUIT AND VEGETABLE COATINGS ON GROCERY-STORE PRODUCE IN THE SPOTLIGHT: 'KNOW WHAT WE'RE EATING'
The change stems from a 2022 petition by the Florida Citrus Processors Association and Florida Citrus Mutual in which they said the average Brix level of Florida oranges was 9.7 in 2022–23.
The current standard was established in 1963 when Florida oranges averaged 11.8 Brix.

Severe weather and citrus greening disease have lowered Brix levels in fruit, forcing producers to import sweeter juice – often from Mexico and Brazil – to blend with theirs in order to meet federal standards, according to the FDA.
""For years, we've been wasting beautiful American oranges simply due to an outdated regulation, while relying on a high volume of imports,"" FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said in a statement.
The change would reduce dependency on imports, potentially saving orange producers more than $50 million annually, the agency estimated.

Growers could still make higher Brix juice if supplies allow, according to the FDA.
Uncle Matt's Organic, which makes a variety ofjuices, lemonades and iced teas,will not be lowering its Brix levels, co-founder Susan McLean said.

""Uncle Matt's Organic orange juice contains no added sugar,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""The naturally occurring sugar content comes directly from the fruit itself, and our Brix is consistently above 11.8, which is well above the minimum threshold.""

""The update will allow struggling growers to market their fruit more effectively without compromising transparency or food safety,"" McLean said.
The move is part of the FDA's review of over 250 Standards of Identity (SOIs), federally defined rules that spell out what certain foods must contain, and sometimes how they are made, in order to be marketed under a specific name.

""The agency is working to ensure its rules are science-based, relevant and responsive to today'sfood supplyand consumer needs,"" the FDA said in a statement.
A public comment period on the proposed rule is open until Nov. 4. The FDA is also seeking feedback on whether to lower the Brix level further.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americas-tipping-culture-spirals-digital-guilt-trip,America's tipping culture spirals from 15% to 30% as digital guilt trip kicks in,"'Bar Rescue' host Jon Taffer joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the impact of President Donald Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' on the restaurant industry.
There was a time whentipping in Americawas simple. You went out to eat, enjoyed your meal and left 15% for good service. If the server was outstanding – or you were feeling generous – you went to 20%. That was the cultural contract we all understood.
When I was first trained on how to sell, my boss told me to always show the customer three choices and leave some room between option one and option three. The rationale behind this is that most people emotionally don’t want to feel cheap, so they won’t pick the lowest option.
They also worry about spending too much, so they won’t pick the most expensive option. What that leaves them is generally picking the one in the middle. When it comes to the pressure oftipping at restaurants, cafes and takeout, we hardly ever emotionally want to feel cheap.

Fast-forward to 2025, and somehow that ""norm"" has ballooned to 25%, 28% and even 30%. It’s simplywayout of control. You’re ordering a $5 latte, and before you take a sip, the card reader spins toward you, asking if you’d like to leave a 30% tip… for a transaction where you poured your own milk, grabbed your own napkin and left the tip before you even got the service. Now, does that make any sense?
IT'S NOT JUST DEMOCRATS. SOCIALIST MAMDANI'S PLANS SHOULD WORRY REPUBLICANS NATIONWIDE
How did we get here? Well, it’s the result of technology, inflation,pandemic-era habitsthat didn’t die – and a growing shift of payroll responsibility onto the customer until the consumer can’t burden it anymore. At 30% tips, we might be reaching our breaking point as Americans.
The Rise of the Digital Guilt Trip
In the old days, you calculated the tip in your head. Now, point-of-sale systems like Square, Clover and Toast flashpre-set tip buttons– 20%, 25%, 30% – with the ""custom tip"" option tucked away like a secret menu item.  Or, even better, many plans automatically add the 20% ""service gratuity"" and play the hide-and-seek game of making you try to figure out the tip they already left for you on the bill.
And let’s be honest: the person who just rang you up often flips the screen around and stands there, watching, while you make your choice. The people in line behind you see it too. It’s not just payment – it’s a real-time social experiment in generosity and public pressure. People have called it ""guilt tipping"" for several years, but it feels like flat out extortion.
TRUMP SENDS MILITARY AFTER THE CARTELS AND IT’S LONG OVERDUE
It’s Not Tariffs. It’s a Shift of Responsibility
Inflationhas been the suggested silent partner in tipping creep. If a burger was $10 a few years ago, a 20% tip was $2. Now that same burger is $14 or $15, so your ""same"" 20% tip is already costing more. But here’s the kicker – those digital prompts aren’t even suggesting 20% anymore. Since the restauranteur sets the amounts, they continue to shift the responsibility by shifting the prompts to a 20%, 22%, 25% and 30% grid, meaning your tip has nearly doubled in dollar terms since 2019.
Whose Job Is It to Pay Wages?
Here’s the part few want to say out loud, but I’ll say it even if nobody likes it: it’s not the customer’s job to pay a company’s employees a fair wage – that’s the employer’s responsibility.
If a bakery chooses to raise its hourly wage from $14 to $18, that’s a cost of doing business. But instead of raising menu prices transparently, many businesses simply crank up the tip prompts, quietly outsourcing payroll costs to customers.
That’s silent inflation. Your coffee didn’t get bigger, your sandwich didn’t improve, but your bill went up because you’re now covering part of the employer’s wage bill – on top of higher food prices.
TRUMP BREAKS 'DAY ONE' PROMISE TO LOWER COSTS AS PRICES SURGE ACROSS AMERICA IN FIRST SIX MONTHS
The Expanding Definition of ""Tippable""
Tipping used to be for service jobs where base pay relied on gratuities – servers, bartenders, delivery drivers. Now? You’ll find tip requests at self-checkout kiosks, bakeries where you serve yourself, and even car washes where you never meet an employee.
And consider companies like Uber, who said the main differentiation was that you don’t have to worry about tips. Now, you are in some weird random dating game where your driver is rating you and you are rating them. Except if you don’t leave a tip, what rating do you think they are really going to give you?
When every transaction is ""tippable,"" tipping stops being a reward for exceptional service and becomes just another line item in your budget.
Are You All Tipped Out?
Mandatory tips erode the meaning of tipping itself.  It’s why people love to travel to Europe because they don’t have to worry about it when they go out for dinner. Customers start tipping out of shame instead of appreciation. And when tipping is seen as automatic, the incentive for great service can disappear. And it’s disappearing every single day. For families already feeling the pinch of inflation, an extra 5–10% on every meal out isn’t small change – it’s real money.

Can We Get A Tipping Reset?
We need a cultural reset. Businesses should be transparent about wages and service fees, rather than quietlyleaning on customersto close the payroll gap.
Payment systems should stop stacking suggested tips at the high end, and customers should feel free to tip based on service – not because a tablet told them to.
Next time the server spins the Toast device toward you with 30% as the first option, remember: you’re rewarding service, not paying the company’s wage bill.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Maybe the answer, is youalwaysclick custom so you can tip what you actually think the service is worth.
Because if we’re not careful, 30% won’t be the ceiling – it’ll be the starting point.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-says-mississippi-can-require-social-media-age-verification-now,"Supreme Court declines to block Mississippi social media age-restriction law, for now","NYU School of Medicine associate professor Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil shares her perspective on Australia’s move to ban social media for children younger than 16 on ‘Fox News Live.’
TheSupreme Courton Thursday declined to block Mississippi from enforcing a law that would block minors from using nine popular social media sites without their parents' consent—delivering a near-term blow to the tech industry group that had sought emergency intervention from the high court.
Justices on the high court did not elaborate on their reasons for rejecting the emergency appeal, filed by industry group NetChoice—a common practice when the Supreme Court decides on an emergency appeal—and did not provide a vote count.
NeChoice had asked the high court to put the law on hold while the case continued to play out in the lower courts on its merits.
Only Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh gave any indication of his thinking in a three-paragraph concurring opinion, writing that, while he believes the law in question is ""likely unconstitutional,"" and that NetChoice ""demonstrated it would likely succeed on the merits"" of the case, he agreed with his colleagues in ruling that the group failed to meet the high bar required for emergency relief.

The case will continue to play out in the lower courts, and is expected to make its way back to the Supreme Court for full consideration at a later date.
At issue is Mississippi'ssweeping social media law,known as H.B. 1126. The law, passed by the state in 2024, blocks young people from accessing popular social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, Pinterest, and Reddit without express parental consent.
It also requires social media sites to take additional steps to verify the ages of users before allowing them to create accounts, and to ""develop and implement a strategy"" to shield young people from exposure to harmful material.
Sites who fail to comply can be fined up to $10,000 per violation, and, in certain cases, could face criminal penalties.

NetChoice quickly sued to block the law, arguing that it violated free speech protections under the First Amendment.
U.S. District Judge Halil Suleyman Ozerden in June issued a preliminary injunction siding with NetChoice and temporarily blocking Mississippi from implementing its law.
While Judge Ozerden acknowledged the state may have a ""compelling interest"" in safeguarding minors online, he said Mississippi's law involved ""substantially more speech than is necessary for the state to accomplish its goals,"" and ran afoul of the First Amendment.
In July, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals voted unanimously and without explanation to freeze the lower court injunction, allowing the law to take force—and prompting the emergency request for Supreme Court intervention.

In its emergency appeal to the high court, lawyers for NetChoice took aim at the lack of explanation from the lower court.
""Neither NetChoice nor this Court can know why the Fifth Circuit believed this law satisfies the First Amendment’s stringent demands or deviated from the seven other decisions enjoining similar laws,"" lawyers said in their appeal to the high court, arguing they would face ""immediate, irreparable"" injury should the law be allowed to go into effect.

The Supreme Court's emergency decision comes as a handful of other states have moved to implement similar age-verification legislation— including Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, and Utah.
NetChoice, for its part, has led similar lawsuits challenging social media legislation in other states such as Florida and Texas earlier this year.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mamdani-defends-city-run-grocery-plan-says-store-owners-can-partners,"Mamdani defends city-run grocery plan, says store owners can be 'partners'","On the fourth day of his anti-Trump tour across New York City, Zohran Mamdani responded to a question from Fox News Digital about his plan for city-run grocery stores.
BRONX, N.Y. –New York City Democratic mayoral candidateZohran Mamdanisaid it will be possible for a ""partnership"" between the city and grocery store and bodega owners, despite his plan to open five city-run grocery stores if elected mayor this November.
""What do you say to the grocery-store owners who are concerned that this could create a ricochet effect, if there are more and more city-owned grocery stores in the city?"" Fox News Digital asked Mamdani at an anti-Trump event in the Bronx on Thursday afternoon.
""I am interested in working with each and every New Yorker, and I've actually spoken with a number of grocery store owners and made clear to them that I both recognize and I appreciate the work that they have done. The fact is that they are a critical part of our communities,"" Mamdani replied.
Mamdani told Fox News Digital that a majority of grocery stores in New York City are family-owned, as he expressed gratitude to those families for investing in New York City, particularly in the 1970s, when he said large retailers left, but these small-business owners stayed because ""they believed in this city.""

""There's so much partnership that we can still offer those same stores in assisting them on the skyrocketing rents that they are facing, the questions of insurance, so much of that which creates instability in their business model, while also ensuring we're using every tool at our disposal to create a more affordable city for New Yorkers,"" Mamdani said.

Like many of his progressive policies, Mamdani's plan to open city-run grocery stores if elected mayor of New York City has raised some eyebrowsabout its feasibility.
But Mamdani explained on Thursday, ""It's not in opposition to grocery store owners or bodega owners. This is something that can together be actually used to increase competitiveness, as we've seen public options do so in the past.""
Like PresidentDonald Trumpduring the 2024 presidential election, Mamdani has made affordability the central theme of his campaign. One way Mamdani is seeking to lower prices for New Yorkers is by opening one city-owned grocery store in each of the five boroughs.
""As Mayor, Zohran will create a network of city-owned grocery stores focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit. Without having to pay rent or property taxes, they will reduce overhead and pass on savings to shoppers,"" according to Mamdani's campaign website.

The Mamdani campaign said the city-run grocery stores will ""buy and sell at wholesale prices, centralize warehousing and distribution, and partner with local neighborhoods on products and sourcing.""
The 33-year-old mayoral hopeful said it's time to redirect public money to create a real ""public option.""
Mamdani told Fox News Digital on Thursday that his plan ""is part of a vision of a public option for produce, an understanding that for fartoo many New Yorkers, groceries are out of reach, and the importance in city government of reasonable policy experimentation.""
He said New Yorkers deserve the same access to produce as they do ""fast food restaurants just around the corner.""

Economists and Wall Street executivessounded the alarmon Mamdani's plan in interviews with Fox News Digital soon after his Democratic primary victory.
John Catsimatidis, owner of the Gristedes supermarket chain, has largely criticized Mamdani's city-run grocery store idea, arguing it would ""hurt New York.""
""If the city of New York is going socialist, I will definitely close, or sell, or move or franchise the Gristedes locations,"" Catsimatidis told Fox Business in an interview in June.

New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani traveled uptown to the Bronx on Thursday for the fourth day of his ""Five Boroughs Against Trump"" tour, arguing that PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration is hurting small businesses.
""We are here today on the fourth stop of our five borough tour, to speak about how Bronx sites can not afford the city that they call home, Mamdani said. ""That is a struggle that many residents of the Bronx feel individually. It's also a struggle that I know our small businesses are feeling at this moment. From 2020 to 2022, the population of the Bronx dropped by 6.3%. That's more than any other borough in New York City. People are leaving this further, leaving this city because it's too expensive. We are the most expensive city in the United States of America.""
Throughout the week, Mamdani has connected Trump to his leading competitor in the race, former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani in June and is now running as an independent candidate.
The theme continued on Thursday as the Mamdani campaign visited Nohble, asmall business in the Bronx, where he argued that both Trump and Cuomo have handed ""tax breaks to billionaires and megacorporations"" throughout their political careers. Meanwhile, Mamdani has made affordability the central message of his campaign.
Trump's ""big, beautiful bill,"" which narrowly passed Congress last month, has been widely celebrated by Republicans for extending Trump's 2017 tax cuts and adding deductions on tipped wages and overtime, while reducing spending on Medicaid and clean energy and strengthening border security.

But Democrats have been quick to claim that Trump's megabill handed tax breaks to the wealthy while cutting benefits to the most vulnerable – a key Democratic message ahead of competitive midterm elections expected in 2026.

While Republicans argue the bill only cuts waste, fraud and abuse in Medicaid, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), about 10 million more people will be uninsured by 2034 due to Trump's mega-bill.
As national Democrats slam Trump's tax breaks, Mamdani has criticized Cuomo's own record as governor, which includes offering $3 billion in tax breaks for thefailed Amazon HQ2 dealin Queens, expanding $420 million-a-yearfilm industry creditsand launching""Tax-Free NY"" zonesto give businesses 10 years without state taxes.

Throughout the week, Mamdani has criticized Cuomo followingThe New York Times reportthat Trump spoke on the phone with Cuomo about how to defeat Mamdani in November. Meanwhile, Mamdani has described how his administration would be Trump's ""worst nightmare.""
""As we see Donald Trump andAndrew Cuomotrip over themselves to reward those who already have a fortune, we will stand up and fight for those that have been forgotten,"" Mamdani said on Staten Island on Wednesday at an anti-Trump event focused on immigration.

The focus on deep blue New York City was seen as politically unusual for a Republican candidate, but Trump spent weeks in New York City for his criminal trial and often used the Big Apple as his own personal campaign trail.
During the rally, Trump vowed to ""turn New York City around,"" promising to make the city ""bigger, better and greater than ever before.""

""We see far too many parallels between Donald Trump and Andrew Cuomo, far too many stories that make clear that both administrations have been characterized by corruption, by a sense of impunity, by an inability of an executive to understand that no means no, a prioritization of the interests of billionaires over working people, and an agenda that is driven by little else beyond the retention and accumulation of power,"" Mamdani said on Monday in Manhattan.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/big-beautiful-bill-gives-parents-choice-kids-chance,"The ‘big, beautiful bill’ gives parents a choice and kids a chance","Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., discusses the House passing the ‘big, beautiful bill’ on ‘Hannity.’
On Independence Day, PresidentDonald Trumpsigned into law the most consequential federal school choice legislation in our nation’s history, declaring educational freedom as a new right for students and families across America. This landmark legislation, a part of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act, will help get American education back on track and improve opportunities for generations of Americans to come.
Quality educationis foundational to success; it is the key to unlocking the American dream, and as Tim Scott rightly says, the closest thing to magic in America.
For too long, however, parents have been forced to accept a one-size-fits-all approach to education that often does not work, and which has failed millions of students across decades. Those failures disproportionately affect low-income and minority families, whose children are frequently trapped in failing schools with no alternatives.

It is a system that led to test scores that lag the rest of the world, poor literacy rates, too many children giving up and dropping out of school – and ultimately, a failure toproperly educateour rising generation.
HOW TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' ENDS DECADES OF TEMPORARY TAX POLICY GAMES IN WASHINGTON
The consequences of academic failure are far more consequential than just failing a grade. Poor academic performance dramatically increases the likelihood of poverty, incarceration, joblessness and drug abuse. When a kid doesn’t achieve his or her potential, it hurts society. It hurts us all.
It was long past time for Washington to act – and we did so decisively.
Giving parents the ability to choose the school that best meets their child’s individual needs is about more than just test scores – it’s about giving every child a real shot at success.
The One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act establishes the first-of-its-kindtax credit scholarshipprogram for all types of educational settings. Beginning in 2027, individuals will receive a dollar-for-dollar tax credit of up to $1,700 per year for donations to educational nonprofits that fund K-12 scholarships for low- and middle-income students.
Eligible scholarships can cover tuition, books, tutoring, transportation, uniforms, special needs services and educational technology. Parents and students will receive these scholarships tax-free.
TRUMP JUST SCORED THE BIGGEST CONSERVATIVE VICTORY IN THREE DECADES
The result? Tens of billions of dollars for scholarships will be made available to K-12 students all across America. Millions of families will now be able to send their children to a school that aligns with their values and beliefs. Parents will be able to reclaim control of their children’s education.
Thirty states right now have at least one private school choice program currently in effect. The education freedom provision we championed – and President Trump signed into law – now gives every state a choice: will they give new opportunities to students, or will they bow to the demands of the union bosses?
Sadly, every single Democrat inCongressvoted against the most important civil rights legislation of the 21st century. But President Trump and the Republican Congress delivered.
It was our responsibility to fix a broken system. Our own parents worked hard and sacrificed to give us opportunities they never had. And we want the same – and more – for today’s children.
As a nation, the truth is weneedmore. We cannot remain the most prosperous, entrepreneurial, groundbreaking nation on Earth if we fail to set our children up for success.

By creating multiple pathways to high-quality education, we ensure that no child remains trapped in an unsafe or failing school. Millions of low- and middle-income students of all races and backgrounds will now benefit enormously from billions in new scholarships. And new hope and opportunity.
The right education can change the course of a child’s life. We know this. Our Founding Fathers knew this. And now, every child in America has the right to access an excellent education – regardless of race, income, or zip code.
Ten, 20, 30 years from now, we will look back at this groundbreaking school choice provision as the single most important part of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill.

President Donald Trumpon Tuesday ramped up his pressure on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates, threatening to allow a lawsuit over the central bank’s $3.1 billion renovation project to move forward.
Trump took to Truth Social to blast Powell, who has refused to adjust rates despite repeated demands by the presidentas inflationremains steady, holding at 2.7% in July.
""Jerome 'Too Late' Powell must NOW lower the rate,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social.

THE FED’S FOOLISH INTEREST RATE POLICY IS STOPPING AMERICA’S ECONOMY FROM BOOMING
""Steve ‘Manouychin’ really gave me a ‘beauty’ when he pushed this loser. The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we’ve blown through Powell and the complacent Board.""
Trump then went on to dangle the prospect of the legal action, although it is unclear what lawsuit Trump was referring to.
""I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings. Three Billion Dollars for a job that should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up. Not good!""
The comments are Trump’s latest public attack against Powell despite appointing him as the Federal Reserve chair in 2017. A Fed spokesperson declined to comment.

GOOD ECONOMIC DATA IS BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP’S INTEREST RATE PUSH
The Federal Reserve’s renovation is focused on two historic buildings in Washington, D.C.: The Marriner S. Eccles Federal Reserve Building and the adjacent 1951 Constitution Avenue structure, also known as the FRB-East Building.
Powell and the Fed have previously defended the ongoing renovations, emphasizing that they’re necessary structural updates and not luxuries, and are in full compliance with plans approved by the National Capital Planning Commission in 2021. Powell and Trump toured the site last month.
In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump slammed the costs of the overhaul.
""We are not going to allow people to spend $3.1 Billion Dollars on fixing up a building, like the Federal Reserve, which could have been done in a far more elegant and time sensitive manner for $50 to $100 Million Dollars,"" Trump wrote. ""The Renovation would have actually been better, and would have saved $3 Billion Dollars, Traffic Jams and never-ending Construction.""
Earlier this month, Trump urged the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors to take control from Powell if he resisted immediate interest rate cuts. The Fed has held its benchmark interest rate range between 4.25%-4.5%, which Trump has argued stifles Americaneconomic growth.
TheFederal Reservedetermines its interest rate policy collectively through a 12-member panel known as the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which votes on those decisions with each member – including Powell – receiving one vote.

I’ve spent more than three decades on the road, proudly building my career as an independent contractor in the trucking industry. Being my own boss allowed me to raise my four daughters, support my family, and chart my own path forward as a business owner. But in 2020, that livelihood was thrown into chaos by a law fromSacramento, California, lawmakerswho ignored how real truckers work and threatened to put thousands of us out of business.
By forcing a one-size-fits-all definition of employment, Assembly Bill 5 (AB 5) made it nearly impossible forsmall business truckersto operate independently in California. I was faced with a heartbreaking decision: stay in my home state and watch my business collapse or leave California to preserve the freedom I had fought so hard for.
MAJOR BUSINESS GROUP INTERVENES TO BLUNT NEWSOM LAWSUIT ATTEMPTING TO REINSTATE EV MANDATES
I chose to leave.
Independent contractor Dee Sova moved her trucking business to Missouri after California passed its AB5 law. Now, Congress is taking up the battle and there's hope on the horizon.
Thousands of independent truckers across the country watched what happened inCaliforniawith fear. Many of us are women, veterans, immigrants and first-generation business owners. The ability to choose when and how we work isn’t just a perk. It’s a lifeline.
That’s why I’m grateful to Republican California Rep.Kevin Kileyfor standing up forindependentworkers like me by introducing ""Modern Worker Empowerment Act,"" which passed out of committee in the House of Representatives passed in late July.
CA DROPS ‘GREEN’ BIG-RIG MANDATES, ENDING LEGAL FIGHT WITH BILL BARR-LINKED GROUP
This bill is a major win forindependent contractors.It restores a consistent, common-sense definition of independent work and ensures that truckers like me can continue building our businesses without being forced into rigid, outdated employment models. After the damage done by AB 5 in California, it’s encouraging to see Congress taking steps in the right direction.

Kiley understands that protecting independent contractors isn’t just about economics — it’s about dignity, autonomy and fairness. He saw how AB 5 crushed opportunity in California and took action to make sure those same mistakes wouldn’t be repeated nationwide.

Running my truck as a small business allowed me to take long hauls across the country — sometimes bringing my children along — while keeping the flexibility and control that mattered most for my family’s well‑being. And I took pride in serving as a role model: showing that women can thrive behind the wheel, own their business and contribute to America’s supply chain.

Thanks to leaders like Rep. Kiley, Washington is finally recognizing that independent contractors deserve the same respect and freedom as traditional employees. I hope the Senate moves quickly to pass this bill and send it to the president’s desk.
I may have had to leave California to keep my business alive — but with this new legislation, maybe one day I’ll be able to come back.

Former New York Gov.Andrew Cuomoslammed Big Apple mayoral opponent Zohran Mamdani Friday for living in a rent-stabilized apartment, despite being ""very rich.""
""Somewhere last night inNew York City, a single mother and her children slept at a homeless shelter because you, assemblyman [Zohran Mamdani], are occupying her rent-controlled apartment,"" Cuomo posted to X on Friday along with a video of the lawmaker saying his monthly rent totals $2,300.
MAMDANI'S FORMER DEM COLLEAGUE RAILS AGAINST HIS SIGNATURE CAMPAIGN PROMISE: 'NAIL IN THE COFFIN'
Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary to Mamdani but is taking him on again as an independent in the general election, called on his opponent to surrender his apartment to someone more deserving of a subsidy. Hecited Mamdani'saffluent upbringing, more than six-figure income and international property ownership. Cuomo also noted Mamdani’s wifeis employed— driving their household income even higher.

""No matter which way you cut it: Zohran Mamdani is a rich person,"" Cuomo said in the post. ""You are actually very rich. Yet you and your wife pay $2,300 a month, as you have bragged, for a nice apartment in Astoria. That should be housing for someone who needs it.""

The former governor also cited New York City'saffordability crisis,noting that millions of the city's low-income residents need reasonably-priced apartments. The median rent in New York City has reached $3,397, a nearly $200 increase since 2024, accordingto Realtor.com.

""Up until now, Zohran Mamdani and his campaign have successfully evaded any scrutiny: He talks like Bernie but lives like Bezos,"" a spokesperson for Cuomo told Fox News Digital in an email. ""It turns out handing the keys of New York City to a no-show, do-nothing assemblyman hypocrite is a bad idea. Andrew Cuomo is running to protect our streets, for REAL affordability, and to build a new New York City by giving opportunity to those who actually need it.""

Las Vegas servers say they're feeling the heat as high prices and declining tourism hammer their tip earnings across the Strip.
Tipping in Sin City is reportedly down by as much as 50% among servers, as some of them blame the economy and policy while others point to high prices, a tipping backlash and poor service.
On Reddit's r/VegasLocals forum, onecocktail waitresswrote, ""I used to average about 80 cents a drink. Now I'm averaging about 10 cents.""

""We are working triple what we used to and making a quarter of what we did,"" another person added on the forum.
Jacob Soto, 22, a supervisor at Pinkbox Doughnuts in downtown Las Vegas, told The Wall Street Journal that he used to make up to $200 a week in credit card tips, but now only earns between $100 and $150.

While the city saw an 11.3% drop in overall visitation in June compared to the same time last year, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority (LVCVA), international travel to Vegas is down approximately 10% year over year.
LAS VEGAS TOURISM DROPS SHARPLY AS SOME VISITORS CLAIM 'CASINOS ARE EMPTY' AMID RISING COSTS
Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union, which represents 60,000 Vegas workers, said federal immigration and economic policies are keeping international travelers away.
""The unions and the industry and the government need to get together and repair the damage and welcome tourism back,"" he told Fox News Digital.
Tourists and residents are pushing back against high prices in Las Vegas.(iStock)
Pappageorge called the tipped income tax exemption proposed in PresidentDonald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill"" a ""welcome relief.""
He pointed out, however, that if workers aren't ""making the tips, the credit doesn't help.""
""Guests are pushing back on $18 bottles of water in the minibar and $37 martinis.""
He said companies have already frozen hiring and made targeted staffing cuts, with part-time workers – who make up 25% of the union's membership – being the first to lose hours.
""If it continues, it could bleed into the full-timers,"" he added.
VEGAS VISITORS SHOCKED BY 'ABSURD' RESORT PRICES THAT ARE TURNING TOURISTS INTO 'SPECTATORS'
Some industry observers assert the problem is more local.
""Many attribute this not only to a general dip ininternational traveldemand to the U.S., but also to aggressive price-gouging by hospitality venues,"" Rob DelliBovi, a consultant and founder of the Miami-based RDB Hospitality Group, told Fox News Digital.

""For the price, it should be impeccable,"" she told Fox News Digital.
She said aggressive upselling tactics, repetitiverestaurant conceptsand a lack of genuine hospitality are turning off tourists and locals alike. As a result, she said she's also seen tip revenue decrease by half compared to last summer.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-caps-off-29th-week-office-peace-deal-celebrating-200th-day-second-presidency,"Trump caps off 29th week in office with peace deal, celebrating 200th day of second presidency","The meeting was meant to end decades of conflict and reopen key transportation routes in the region.
PresidentDonald Trumphas capped off his 29th week back in the Oval Office, which included celebrating his 200th day as the 47th president, completing revamps to the White House's Rose Garden and an overall focus on the U.S. economy and international diplomacy that unfolded at a break-neck pace this week.
""In just 200 days, President Trump has turned America into the hottest country in the world,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital, reflecting on Trump's 200th day in office on Thursday. ""Under Joe Biden’s failed leadership, families and businesses were struggling, and America was dead — but President Trump has quickly restored American greatness. The historic trade deals and peace deals he secured on behalf of the American people made President Trump’s second 100 days just as successful as the first.""
The first 100 days of a new administration have commonly been viewed as a symbolic benchmark to measure a president's early successes. A White House official told Fox Digital that Trump's measure of success was seen not only in the first 100 days, but also in the timeframe between the 100th day and Aug. 7 — the 200th day.
TRUMP WHITE HOUSE CELEBRATES LATEST CHAPTER OF WINS AT 200-DAY MARK
Trump's 29th week in office included an overall and ongoing focus on new business investments in the U.S. and new tariffs on foreign nations as the administration looks to bring parity to the U.S.' historic trade deficit with other nations. The White House teased that Trump would make a major announcement on Wednesday, which ultimately revealed Apple had increased its U.S. investment commitment by $100 billion to $600 billion.
""Today Apple is announcing that it will invest $600 billion — that's with a B — in the United States over the next four years. That's $100 billion more than they were originally going to invest. And this is the largest investment Apple has ever made in America and anywhere else,"" Trump said on Wednesday from the Oval Office, where he was joined by Apple CEO Tim Cook.
Trump's announcement on the deal was one facet of this week's focus on theU.S. economy. The president signed a pair of executive orders on Thursday allowing Americans to invest their 401(k) retirement plans in cryptocurrency, private equity and real estate, as well as another EO that works to ensure that banks do not ""deny or restrict services based on political beliefs, religious beliefs, or lawful business activities,"" according the EO.
Trump kicked off the week by announcing he would increasetariffs on Indiaover the country's continued purchase of Russian oil, with goods from India now facing a 50% tariff. The tariff hikes followed months of the U.S. and India holding trade negotiations that appeared to be all but solidified in July, but fell to pieces by August.
""Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because theirTariffs are far too high,among the highest in the World, and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary Trade Barriers of any Country,"" Trump wrote on social media on Wednesday.

""Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipmentfrom Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE — ALL THINGS NOT GOOD! INDIA WILL THEREFORE BE PAYING A TARIFF OF 25%, PLUS A PENALTY FOR THE ABOVE, STARTING ON AUGUST FIRST. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER. MAGA!"" he continued.
Trump's tariff plans aim to increase the amount of American-built products and U.S.-based companies, and the president said he would also impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips. Companies ""building in the United States,"" however, will be exempt from the tariffs, he said.
""100 percent tariff on all chips and semiconductors coming into the United States, but if you've made a commitment to build, or if you're in the process of building, as many are, there is no tariff,"" he said on Wednesday.
President Trump announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Aug, 15.(Reuters)
Trump wrapped up the working week by holding a trilateral meeting with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan to sign a peace agreement after the two nations have battled one another since the 1980s over a territorial conflict.
The White House said Friday that the two nations agreed to build a road connecting Azerbaijan and an autonomous enclave currently separated by Armenian territory. The road will be called the ""Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity,"" according to the White House.
TRUMP HAS NOW BEEN IN OFFICE FOR SIX MONTHS, FOR THE SECOND TIME. HERE ARE THE HIGHLIGHTS
""The roadmap they are agreeing to will build a cooperative future that benefits both countries, their region of the South Caucasus and beyond,"" White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Friday of the peace deal.
The peace deal comes as Trump continues working to reach a ceasefire agreement between Russia and Ukraine as the war that broke out in 2022 continues raging between the nations. Armenia and Azerbaijan are both former constituent republics of the Soviet Union.

Trump said earlier this week that he is open to meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which would mark the pair's first meeting since Trump was sworn back into office this year.
""As President Trump said yesterday, the Russians expressed their desire to meet with President Trump, and the President is open to this meeting. President Trump would like to meet with both President Putin and President Zelensky, because he wants this brutal war to end. The White House is working through the details of these potential meetings, and details will be provided at the appropriate time,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement on Thursday.

Trump announced in March that he planned to renovate the historic garden with pavers, explaining that the grass ""doesn’t work"" and citing how the soft terrain was difficult for some visitors to navigate.
""We’re getting great reviews of the Rose Garden, and we had to do it,"" Trump told reporters on Sunday of the update.
The area was officially paved over with a bright white patio boasting theWhite House's emblem on its perimeter.
""When we had a press conference, you’d sink into the mud. It was grass, and it was very wet, always wet and damp and wet, and if it rained, it would take three, four, five days to dry out, and we couldn’t use it really for the intended purpose,"" he added.

If you wanted to send me a letter via mail with youropinion about this column, it would cost you 78 cents.
Let that sink in.
That’s the current price of aforever stamp in America– yes, the same ones that cost 39 cents in 2006. That’s a 100% increase in less than two decades.

In just the last five years, stamp prices have jumped from 55 cents to 66, then 68, then 73, 76, and now 78 cents. That is an 8% per annum inflation rate on stamps since 2020.
YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SOLUTION TO THE DEBT CRISIS, BUT HERE'S HOW TO FIX AMERICA'S SPENDING PROBLEM
The U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is raising prices so often, it's starting to feel like you're trying to ship your letter via Space X to Mars, not to your grandmother in Des Moines.
And still, somehow, they’re losing money, the one thing government is great at.
Let’s unpack this. According to USPS financial statements, the agency posted a net loss of $6.5 billion in 2023. Yes,billion –with a ""B."" This comes after price hikes on stamps, shipping and package delivery services.
While USPS has been hemorrhaging money, it’s also spending millions on failed pilot programs like Sunday deliveries that no one asked for.(FOX 29 Philadelphia)
And the kicker? Mail volume continues to plummet. First-class mail has dropped more than 50% since 2001. It’s not hard to see why. When everything from paying bills to saying ""Happy Birthday"" can be done with the tap of a phone screen, why would anyone fork over nearly a buck to lick a stamp?
INVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES
Here’s the brutal truth: theU.S. Postal Serviceis a 247-year-old relic, clinging to a 20th-century business model in a 21st-century digital economy. It’s like Blockbuster trying to survive in the age of Netflix.
And who pays the price? You do. I do. Every American taxpayer does. And every business owner trying to ship a product or communicate with customers. Have you seen the cost of an overnight UPS or FedEx package as of late?
And it’s not just stamps. USPS lost $94 billion between 2007 and 2020. The agency carries more than $188 billion in liabilities and unfunded obligations. Meanwhile, private carriers like FedEx and UPS are thriving, innovating and investing in automation while USPS remains bloated, bureaucratic and bogged down by outdated infrastructure and a labor force that’s nearly impossible to reform due to union pressure and congressional meddling.
THE FED’S FOOLISH INTEREST RATE POLICY IS STOPPING AMERICA’S ECONOMY FROM BOOMING
Some will say, ""But, Ted, thePostal Serviceprovides a vital public good. It connects rural America. It delivers medications. It ensures equity.""
I don’t disagree with the mission. But can we at least agree that any business – public or private – that loses billions of dollars every year and still raises prices for lower service should be held accountable?
Here’s where it gets even more ridiculous. While USPS has been hemorrhaging money and shedding mail volume, it’s also spending millions on failed pilot programs like banking services, Sunday deliveries that no one asked for, and electric vehicles that sound great in a press release but cost taxpayers far more than the savings they’ll ever bring.

In the age of social media, you can tweet me, post on my LinkedIn page or leave a comment below – instantly, freely and from anywhere. Yet the very government that promised to provide ""universal service"" at low cost is now charging more for a worse product. And they still expect a round of applause. Recently, it took 10 days for a birthday card to get to my own mother.
This isn’t just about stamps. It’s about government waste. It’s about poor planning. It’s about politicians kicking the can down the road for decades, refusing to modernize, streamline or privatize when necessary. And it’s about us, the American people, being asked to pay more for less – and being told to be grateful for it.

So, if you feel strongly about what I wrote, I dare you: write me a letter. Stick a stamp on it. Mail it to my office. But before you drop it in the blue box, just ask yourself:Is your opinion worth 78 cents?
Because that’s what it costs to be heard in today’s America if you want to send your two cents via USPS.

""llegal employment exposes workers to potential trafficking, exploitation and other dangerous situations.

""These patterns are two sides of the same coin. Just 30 years ago, the median age of first-time home buyers was 28. Today, it’s 38. In 2000, the typical price of a single-family home was three times a family’s annual income — today, it’s six times,"" he wrote.
The former mayor stated that this is one of the primary reasons that ""a full third of young adults now report a sense of despondency.""

Emanuel wrote in his column that young men in particular are feeling that the American dream is out of reach and have become despondent.(REUTERS/Joshua Lott)
He continued, noting that men are particularly affected by this reality, whetherDemocratic figureswant to admit it or not.
""But, unpopular as it may be to say in some quarters of my party, the crisis affects one gender with particular potency,"" he said. ""Like it or not, American men are still raised to believe that their role is to act as providers and protectors. And when men whose self-worth is tied up in that aspiration realize they’ll never be able to buy a home, they’re bound to feel shame and anger.""
Emanuel argued that, instead of shying away from this issue or prioritizing other ones, his party needs to address this, as it’s the real way to ""save our democracy.""
""Democrats talk all the time about democracy being on the ballot. But the solution won’t be found only in registering more voters or making mail-in balloting universal. The problem is that real generation-over-generation prosperity is harder to achieve today,"" he wrote.
""This shouldn’t be some mystery: American democracy became unstable at almost exactly the same time the American Dream became unaffordable. And because that’s not a coincidence, we need to tackle the homeownership challenge head-on,"" he added.

Emanuel, who said in June he is consideringrunning for presidenton the Democratic ticket in 2028, has been making the media rounds in recent months to advise his party on how to bounce back from the 2024 presidential election loss.
During an interview on CNN in July, Emanuel provided some tough love for the party,telling CNN host Dana Bash, ""Just to give you a sense of how bad we are – the Democratic Party is less popular than Elon Musk right now. That should be like a wake-up call – how bad.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-white-house-celebrates-latest-chapter-wins-200-day-mark,Trump White House celebrates latest chapter of wins at 200-day mark,"Conservative Gen Z influencer Bo Loudon and National Review staff writer Caroline Downey weigh in on the Sydney Sweeney jeans ad and President Donald Trump's support of her on 'The Ingraham Angle.'
PresidentDonald Trumpnotched his 200th day back in office Thursday, with the administration celebrating a lengthy list of wins across its latest chapter of actions and policies unfolding at a breakneck pace.
""In just 200 days, President Trump has turned America into the hottest country in the world,"" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. ""Under Joe Biden’s failed leadership, families and businesses were struggling, and America was dead — but President Trump has quickly restored American greatness. The historic trade deals and peace deals he secured on behalf of the American people made President Trump’s second 100 days just as successful as the first.""
Trump hit his 100th day of his second administration in April, which included operating at warp speed as Trump signed dozens of executive orders, leveled harsh tariffs on foreign nations to bring parity to the U.S.' trade deficit, negotiated with foreign nations to work to end wars, unveiled the Department of Government Effeciency to investigate the federal government for potential mismanagement and fraud, locked down the U.S. border with Mexico and continued an overhaul of the federal government so it falls in line with the admin's ""America First"" policies.
The first 100 days of a new administration commonly has been viewed as a symbolic benchmark to measure a president's early successes. A White House official told Fox Digital that Trump's measure of success was not only seen in the first 100 days, but also in the timeframe between the 100th day and Aug. 7 — the 200th day.
The White House touted that the administration across the board has seen big wins involving immigration, the economy and trade, education, foreign policy, bilateral meetings, strides in the AI race, unleashing energy initiatives and releasing bombshell details on the Russia hoax from the Obama era in the past 100 days.

The president secured a massive win ahead of the Fourth of July when Republican lawmakers in Washington passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump touted as securing big tax cuts that will make the U.S. economy similar to a ""rocket ship"" as Americans begin feeling its effects.
House and Senate Republicansdelivered the legislation to Trump’s desk in July after a hard-fought battle that included a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in their condemnation of the bill, mostly over its increase to the debt limit.
The bill includes key provisions to permanently establish individual and business tax breaks included in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and incorporates new tax deductions to cut duties on tips and overtime pay. It also rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump’s mass deportation efforts and institutes Medicaid reforms.
""We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent,"" Trump said during the July signing ceremony. ""That's the largest tax cut in the history of our country. . . .  After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically. We've delivered no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors. It makes the child tax credit permanent for 40 million American families. The Golden Age of America is upon us.""
On the economic front in the last 100 days: the U.S. economygrewat a 3.0% pace in the second quarter, which shattered forecasters' predictions; Trump secured trade deals with nations such as South Korea, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines and the European Union. While businesses such as drugmaker AstraZeneca, carmaker Rolls-Royce, and various tech companies pledging millions in investments in the U.S.
Trump celebrated ahead of his inauguration that the ""golden age"" of America would unfold under his leadership — which has been a common theme across his past 200 days. At the forefront of Trump's ""golden age"" plan of action has not only involved leveling tariffs on foreign nations, but also unleashing artificial intelligence and energy initiatives.
""From this day forward, it'll be a policy of the United States to do whatever it takes to lead the world in artificial intelligence,"" Trump said in July, when he signed a trio of executive orders aimed at boosting the country's artificial intelligence capabilities.
DETAILS OF TRUMP'S HIGHLY ANTICIPATED AI PLAN REVEALED BY WHITE HOUSE AHEAD OF MAJOR SPEECH
The Trump administration rolled ut its AI Action Plan in July after Trump ordered the federal government in January to develop a plan of action for artificial intelligence in order to ""solidify our position as the global leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans."" The AI Action Plan includes a three-pillar approach focused on American workers, free speech and protecting U.S.-built technologies.

The Trump administration has notched massive wins in the artificial intelligence race in recent days, which pits the U.S. against China to develop the mosthigh-tech artificial intelligencesystems. Oracle and OpenAI, for exampled, announced in July that the companies will further develop the Stargate project, which is an effort to launch large data centers in the U.S. The two companies' most recent announcement promises an additional 4.5 gigawatts of Stargate data center capacity, a move expected to create more than 100,000 jobs across operations, construction and indirect roles such as manufacturing and local services.
While the U.S. General Services Administration announced on Wednesday that OpenAI's ChatGPT Enterprise is now available to all federal agencies to incorporate into their workflow at $1 per agency, the GSA told Fox Digital. The deal with OpenAI, the tech company behind ChatGPT, is part of GSA's OneGov Strategy that aims to modernize ""how the federal government purchases goods and services"" under the Trump administration.

While the AI race hits new levels, Trump has also cut red tape surrounding the energy sector — which is vital to the growth of AI and the tech sector. Energy companies in the past 100 days have pledged billions to upgrade nuclear plants and modernize gas pipelines, while the administration celebrated the July opening of the newest coal plant in Wyoming in decades, as well as Trump signing a multidecade agreement to increase natural gas exports to Europe.
On the domestic political front, the Trump administration has also championed uncovering and releasing further details surrounding theRussian collusion hoaxthat plagued Trump's 2016 presidential win and first presidency.
Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard released bombshell unclassified documents in July that reportedly show ""overwhelming evidence"" that then-President Barack Obama and his national security team allegedly laid the groundwork for what would be the yearslong Trump–Russia collusion probe after Trump's election win against former Secretary of StateHillary Clintonin 2016.
FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM
""The implications of this are frankly nothing short of historic,"" Gabbard told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo in July.
""Over 100 documents that we released on Friday really detail and provide evidence of how this treasonous conspiracy was directed by President Obama just weeks before he was due to leave office after President Trump had already gotten elected,"" she continued. ""This is not a Democrat or Republican issue. This is an issue that is so serious it should concern every single American, because it has to do with the integrity of our democratic republic.""
Attorney GeneralPam Bondidirected the DOJ to act on the criminal referral Gabbard sent in July over the matter. Amid the DNI's bombshell revelations, FBI Director Kash Patel reported late in July that the FBI had recovered a trove of sensitive documents related to the origins of the Trump–Russia probe buried in multiple ""burn bags"" left in the bureau. Burn bags are used to destroy documents designated as classified or higher, Fox Digital previously reported.

Trump is expected to continue the breakneck pace of presidential actions and policies as his administration continues ironing out trade deals, negotiating with Russia to end the war continuing to rage in Ukraine, as well as a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, and prepares for another high-stake overseas trip to the UK in September, when the royal family is expected to roll out the red carpet for Trump's unprecedented second state visit to the country.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/its-time-newsom-pull-brake-on-californias-128-billion-ghost-train,It’s time for Newsom to pull the brake on California’s $128 billion ghost train,"Fix California senior advisor Katie Zacharia joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why she considers the rail project a 'waste of tax dollars' and the latest on Democrats' effort to unmask ICE agents as they face growing threats.
It’s not every day a state manages to burn through billions and still ask for more. But California’shigh-speed rail projecthas always been exceptional in that way.
Last month, the federal government finally said enough, scrapping $4 billion in funding after years of missed deadlines, ballooning budgets and political theatrics. You’d think that would halt the train. Instead, the state celebrated by tweeting about construction jobs and posting photos of rebar.Ten years ago, I did the math and showed that for the price of California’s high-speed rail project, we could flyevery Californianroundtrip to Tokyo, buy them a bullet train ticket to Kyoto and put them up for two nights at the Ritz-Carlton. And we’d still have money left over for sushi.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom calls for a new way for California to redraw it's voting districts during a news conference In Sacramento, Calif., Friday July 25, 2025(AP Photo by Rich Pedroncelli)
A decade later, the bullet train still hasn’t arrived. But the fantasy rolls on, powered by taxpayer dollars and bureaucratic inertia.
HIGH-SPEED RAIL ISN'T CALIFORNIA'S ONLY EXPENSIVE BOONDOGGLEWith the federal spigot finally turned off, the California High-Speed Rail Authority responded not with humility but with a victory lap: proudly tweeting that it had created ""15,500 jobs"" on what it still calls ""America’s only high-speed rail project.""
The image? A construction worker twisting rebar beside an American flag – an attempt to wrap a failed infrastructure project in patriotism. But no flag can cover what this really is: ataxpayer-funded monumentto mismanagement.

The promise that voters approved in 2008 was clear: a 220 mph electric train connecting San Francisco and Los Angeles for $33 billion. A transformative project that would rival the Shinkansen in Japan or the TGV in France. But since then, the cost has soared to $128 billion – and the finish line keeps receding into the future.
The real project today? A partial rail segment between Merced and Bakersfield, two cities that were never at the heart of the project’s original purpose. It’s like building an airport shuttle that runs between a cornfield and a rest stop. No one asked for it. No one will ride it.
3 REASONS CALIFORNIA’S GREEN ENERGY CAMPAIGN IS DYING ON THE VINEThe High-Speed Rail Authority now leans hard on ""job creation"" as the justification. Of course it does. When a project stops making sense as transportation, ""jobs"" becomes the political life raft. But as Milton Friedman famously said, if you just want to create jobs, you could hand workers spoons instead of shovels.
Ten years later, the math still checks out. You could:Fly every Californian – roughly 39 million people – roundtrip to Tokyo in coach: $1,200 per personAdd a roundtrip Shinkansen bullet train ticket to Kyoto: $200Two nights at the Ritz-Carlton Kyoto: $1,400Total: $2,800 per person × 39 million = $109 billion
MORNING GLORY: DEFINING VULGARITY DOWNThat’s still $19 billion cheaper than California’s train to nowhere. Or put differently: for what we’ve spent on a train no one can ride, we could have given every person in the state a literal journey of a lifetime.And yet the project continues – because no one in Sacramento wants to be the one to stop it. Least of all,Gov. Gavin Newsom, who publicly ""paused"" the project in 2019, then quietly restarted it three years later.

He now appears to be auditioning for national office. But if he runs, this project will run with him. It should. It deserves his name: The Newsom Line. A monument to ambition without competence.

Instead, we’re funding a jobs program disguised as a train.Gov. Newsom, pull the brake. If you want to be a national leader, show some leadership. End this.

Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., suggested that New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani represents the ""new generation"" of leaders young Democrats are looking for.
From hispast condemnations of policeto his defense of people using the phrase ""Globalize the Intifada,"" Mamdani’s record of far-left statements has put both Republicans and Democrats on high alert.

Tsirkin also asked if the prominence of the cost of living issue is why Mamdani won such a surprising victory in New York.
""Yeah,"" Slotkin agreed. ""I've said very openly that I don't – I never would be called an expert on New York City politics, but the two messages were like a blinking red light. How can you miss them? People are still extremely focused on thecost of livingand how they can't get ahead.

Speaking withThe Free Press' Bari Weiss, the union boss said Sanders ""doesn't talk to me anymore.""
O'Brien spoke at the 2024 Republican National Convention but saidhe never heard backfrom the Democratic National Committee after requesting to speak. The Teamsters did not endorse Trump or Harris in 2024.
Asked if he used to talk to Sanders often, O'Brien said he used to do rallies with him: ""I think he looks at it as a betrayal of not endorsing the Democratic Party.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/exclusive-trump-admin-nixes-giant-wind-farm-approved-last-minute-biden-team,EXCLUSIVE: Trump admin nixes giant wind farm approved 'last-minute' by Biden team,"New Jersey Assemblyman Paul Kanitra on President Donald Trump's vow to halt the construction of windmills on U.S. soil, his push for Europe to stop building windmills and the dangers of wind energy.
FIRST ON FOX:President Donald Trump's Interior Department is canceling what would have been one of the largest land-based wind farms in the United States after former President Joe Biden's ""last-minute"" push to approve the project during his final weeks in office.
TheLava Ridge Wind Project,approved in December 2024 by the Biden administration's Bureau of Land Management, was expected to be a 1,000-megawatt wind farm with up to 231 wind turbines across nearly 57,447 acres in southern Idaho.
Following a review of the project by the Trump administration, officials at the Interior Department claimed to find ""crucial legal deficiencies"" with Biden's approval of the project, including certain statutorily binding criteria that were ignored, according to a press release announcing the decision to terminate the wind farm project.

""Under President Donald Trump's bold leadership, the Department is putting the brakes on deficient, unreliable energy and putting the American people first,"" said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. ""By reversing the Biden administration's thoughtless approval of the Lava Ridge Wind Project, we are protecting tens of thousands of acres from harmful wind policy while shielding the interests of rural Idaho communities. This decisive action defends the American taxpayer, safeguards our land, and averts what would have been one of the largest, most irresponsible wind projects in the nation.""
The Interior Department's action follows a Day One executive order signed by Trump that moved to place a temporary moratorium on the controversial wind project. The order was followed up by another executive directive from Idaho GOP Gov.Brad Little,which directed state agencies to comply with Trump's order to halt the Lava Ridge project and other wind energy leasing in all areas within the Offshore Continental Shelf.
In Trump's executive order, the president also requested a new review be conducted by the Interior Department, citing the fact that the Biden administration may have skirted certain legal obligations associated with approving the Lava Ridge project.

Idaho Attorney General Raul Labrador previously accused the Biden administration of not adequately reviewing the wind farm's potential risk to low-flying aircraft. According to Labrador, Federal Aviation Administration rules dictate that any structure over 200-feet tall must be evaluated for low-level flight hazards.
Labrador has also asserted that the Lava Ridge project would have mainly shipped generated powerto California,as opposed to Idaho.
Meanwhile, Idaho GOP Congressman Mike Simpson accused the Biden approval process in a June op-ed of failing to ""genuinely engage with stakeholders to address concerns about the Minidoka National Historic Site, grazing, wildfire response, and more.""
""For four years, the Biden administration demonstrated that it would rather prioritize renewable wind power over multiple-use mandates directed by Congress,"" Simpson added.

In a press release put out Wednesday, the Interior Department said it was ""restoring common sense to American energy policy by reversing the Biden administration’s misguided, last-minute push to approve the Lava Ridge Wind Project.""
""Under PresidentDonald J. Trump,the Department of the Interior will no longer provide preferential treatment towards unreliable, intermittent power sources that harm rural communities, livelihoods and the land,"" the press release concluded.

The defining promise ofDonald Trump’s 2024 campaignwas lower costs on ""Day One."" He broke it.  The first six months of this administration have been marked by ever-higher prices.
Republicans in Congress would be wise to remember that voters are never quicker to fire elected officials than when they break a core promise. It is this Congress who will be on the ballot next year, notDonald Trump.
The campaign trail promises sounded too good to be true, because they were.  Trump committed to ""end"" inflation, cut energy costs ""in half,"" make health care more affordable, and that Americans would see ""drastic price reductions"" and cheaper groceries.

For most swing voters,lower costswere the whole point of voting for those now in power. They were counting on policies that would improve their lives, not make them harder. As polls show, the anger runs deep for a president and Congress who are gutting the social safety net, dolling out special favors to their wealthy friends and personally profiting from high office.
WHY AOC COULD TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 AND KAMALA HARRIS WON'T
Working Americans are speaking out against the policies that are making life more expensive. And candidates running in 2025 and 2026 have a duty to listen.
We help lead the bipartisan Cost Coalition, which exists to show how Washington’s economic agenda is making the American Dream unaffordable. The most credible voices in this fight aren’t in Washington; they’re our neighbors who are paying more and getting less.  America’s working families, veterans, small businesses and people of faith, are rising up to tell the real story.
Take Trump’s signature Washington policy solution, the ""big, beautiful bill,"" which raises costs. Itsinflationary tax breaksfor the wealthy mean gutting the safety net and kicking 10 million Medicaid beneficiaries off of their health insurance.
When Allison Harris’ daughter was diagnosed with cancer, steep medical bills would have bankrupted their family even with private insurance coverage. Michigan’s Medicaid program helped cover the costs. She told their local news station that when the ""big, beautiful bill"" was signed, she felt ""fear and disgust. Because you never know until something like this cancer journey happens, exactly how much stuff costs.""
DON'T BE FOOLED. MAMDANI ISN'T THE FUTURE OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THESE TWO PATRIOTIC WOMEN ARE
Her daughter, Kendall Williams, added, ""I feel like the fact that they even signed it into law just shows how some adults don’t have common sense.""
Common sense is hard to find inWashington, especially when it comes to the economic whiplash from blanket tariffs that are fueling a new wave of inflation.
The price of ground beef is at a record high and more Americans are using Buy Now, Pay Later to afford groceries. Large retailers like Wal-Mart and Amazon have already raised prices. And now Proctor and Gamble says tariffs will increase prices on common household products from Tide detergent to Luv’s diapers.
""It’s hard enough to buy the things my family needs. Raising that cost is going to make it harder,"" Ohian Charlene Monoskie said to her local news.
It’s not just families. Hard choices are facing small business owners – eat the tariffs or raise prices on their customers.
TRUMP'S TARIFFS AND TAX CUTS ARE CRUSHING MAIN STREET AND MAKING MAR-A-LAGO ELITES RICH
After decades teaching in Pennsylvania schools, Jamie Pikulsky opened the From Scratch Uniontown cafe, where she tries to keep her prices affordable to compete with larger chains. But tariffs mean she’s paying $600 more a month for the coffee she serves her customers. She says: ""I don't know of any small business right now that is thriving. It's tough across the board.""
Instead of ending inflation ""immediately,"" like Trump promised the country at the Republican National Convention last summer, his policies have made inflation worse. And more pain could be on the way with the latest round of tariffs, after failed negotiations didn’t yield 90 deals in 90 days.
Both parties should fight against the Washington agenda that is raising costs.
More elected Republicans need to think for themselves. Sen.Thom Tillis, R-N.C., had the guts to choose the people of North Carolina over the ""big, beautiful bill."" Tillis spoke out on the Senate floor, asking his colleagues, ""What do I tell 663,000 people in two years or three years when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there?"" Tillis knew that kicking people out of their health insurance shifts costs onto all of us.

And Democrats must show they are listening to working people by focusing relentlessly on lowering costs and growing the economy.
Former North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, who is running to succeed Tillis, is showing the way by calling out ""politicians in D.C. [who] are running up our debt, ripping away our healthcare, disrespecting our veterans, cutting help for the poor, and even putting Medicare and Social Security at risk, just to give tax breaks to billionaires.""
So is Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who says: ""The cost of living inthe economyis the driving issue for the average person.  It’s just not always driving the conversation among political elites.""

Teamsters president Sean O’Brien accused then-Vice President Kamala Harris of pressuring his union for an endorsement Tuesday, recounting a tense meeting in which she allegedly said the union ""better get on board.""
O’Brien spoke with The Free Press founder and editor Bari Weiss on her ""Honestly"" podcast about who truly represents the American working class in ashifting political landscape.
He described one off-putting encounter a Teamsters leader had with the 2024 presidential candidate in a photo op line:
""So, Joan goes in the line and Joan says, 'I'm Joan Corey. I'm a vice president with the Teamsters Union,' and [Harris] pointed her finger at Joan and said, 'Teamsters better get on board,' and so Joan says, 'Excuse me?' 'Yeah, Teamsters better get on board. I don't know why you haven't endorsed me yet.' So she comes back, and she tells me this, and I'm like, 'The nerve!'""

Teamsters boss Sean O'Brien shared multiple unflattering anecdotes about then-Vice president Kamala Harris.
O’Brien, who hascriticized the Democratic Partyin the past, went on to claim that when Harris met with the union’s executive board, which had prepared a slate of 16 questions, she only answered four questions.
""She really didn’t answer the questions, and then on the fourth question my chief of staff slides me an index card and says, ‘This is the last question. She’s not answering anymore,’ because she wanted to, like, pontificate and give her speech of why the country is the way it is, why we should endorse her.""
O’Brien paraphrased her closing as essentially telling the union leadership, ""‘Listen, I’m going to win with you or without you.’""
""And it was like such a smug answer, like, okay, and that turned the majority of the people in that room off her,"" he said. O’Brien then described their postmortem of the meeting, noting that many in the union leadership were turned off by Harris’ smug demeanor and body language.
""You could smell it a mile away,"" he said.

Sen.Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is under criminal investigation for mortgage fraud, a Trump administration source told Fox News.
Fox News host Laura Ingraham broke the news on Tuesday night on ""The Ingraham Angle,"" saying the source said a criminal investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland on possible charges involving mortgage fraud.
The investigation comes a month after a story broke about the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sending a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) alleging that Schiff, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms.
In a 2011 affidavit signed by the then California congressman, Schiff certified that a property in Montgomery County, Maryland, is his primary residence.

Schiff also owns a condominium in Burbank, California, which he has also claimed as his primary residence as recently as 2023, during his campaign for Senate.
Schiff's office did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on the matter.
The director of the UFHFA sent a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche in May citing alleged misconduct by Schiff.

""Based on media reports, Mr. Adam B. Schiff has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property,"" FHFA Director William Pulte wrote in the letter. ""As regulator of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Banks, we take very seriously allegations of mortgage fraud or other criminal activity. Such misconduct jeopardizes the safety and soundness of FHFA’s regulated entities and the security and stability of the U.S. mortgage market.""
Pulte later received a memo from the Fannie Mae financial crimes investigations concluding that Schiff allegedly engaged in ""a sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation"" on five Fannie Mae loans, Fox News has learned.
Schiff and his wife purchased a home in Potomac, Maryland, in 2003 for $870,000, according to the letter. They entered into a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage agreement for $610,000 at a rate of 5.625% over a term of 30 years, asserting the property would be their primary and principal residence.

The letter said they reaffirmed that the Maryland home was their primary residence in mortgage refinancing filings in 2009, 2011, 2012 and 2013, despite Schiff being an elected official representing the state of California at the same time.
Fox News obtained a copy of the 2011 affidavit showing Schiff signed certifying that the Maryland house is his primary residence.
Pulte said Schiff and his wife did not list the Maryland home as their secondary residence until 2020.
Over the same time frame, Schiff took a homeowner’s tax exemption on a condo that he owns inBurbank, California,also claiming that home as his primary residence for a $7,000 reduction off of the 1% property tax, Pulte wrote, citing media reports.
In 2023, the letter notes, a spokesperson for Schiff asserted that, ""Adam’s primary residence is Burbank, California, and will remain so when he wins the Senate seat.""
The federal housing official wrote that he believes Schiff's alleged misconduct could be violations of federal criminal codes banning wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and false statements to financial institutions.
Schiff ""appears to have falsified records in order to receive favorable loan terms, and also appears to have been aware of the financial benefits of a primary residence mortgage when compared to a secondary residence mortgage,"" Pulte wrote.

According to the letter, a spokesperson for Schiff in 2023 told CNN that, ""Adam’s California and Maryland addresses have been listed as primary residences for loan purposes because they are both occupied throughout the year and to distinguish them from a vacation property.""

Donald Trump didn't like the slight gain in jobs that thegovernment reportedfor July. So he fired the commissioner for labor statistics, who nobody had heard of until 10 minutes ago.
Problem solved?
Well, not exactly.
Erika McEntarfer, the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, didn’t unilaterally make the decision that the economy added just 73,000 jobs in July. That figure was produced by hundreds ofLabor Department analysts, following established rules, before it reached her level.
TRUMP ECONOMIC ADVISER FIRES BACK AT NBC HOST OVER 'SHOOTING THE MESSENGER' CLAIM ABOUT BLS FIRING
For the president to claim, without proof, that this was ""rigged""—to make him, and Republicans look bad–doesn’t change the underlying reality. The number was disappointing. That hasn’t changed.
The same goes for the downward revision of 258,000 jobs in the previous two months.
That is incredibly common. It happened during the Biden administration, in one case a downward revision of an earlier jobs estimate. It’s a standard adjustment made once more information has become available.
But the economy is what it is. Dumping the Biden appointee doesn’t change that.

Maybe there’s a problem with the constant revisions, but that’s been going on for years. McEntarfer should have put out a more detailed statement.
There has been an avalanche of media criticism for the president undermining confidence in the reliability of the numbers we all depend on.
Kevin O’Leary, the ""Shark Tank"" investor, told CNN: ""I did not agree on whacking the commissioner. I don’t like that. Whacking statisticians makes no sense whatsoever. You don’t shoot the messenger.""
Trump’s BLS chief in the first term, Bill Beach, said ""the commissioner doesn’t do anything to collect the numbers. The commissioner doesn’t see the numbers until Wednesday before they’re published. By the time the commissioner sees the numbers, they’re all prepared…
""When I was commissioner, we had a 500,000 job revision during PresidentTrump’s first term,"" he told CNN. ""And why do we do that? Because firms are created or firms go out of business, and we don’t really know that during the course of the year, until we reconcile against a real full count of all the businesses.""
TRUMP VOWS TO REPLACE LABOR STATISTICS CHIEF WITH SOMEONE 'COMPETENT AND QUALIFIED'
Democrats, of course, are going haywire. Janet Yellen, Biden’s Treasury secretary and Fed chief, said it reeked of a ""banana republic.""
So once the president names his own person, will the markets and the public have confidence that future jobs numbers are real? Or will that appointee cook the books in his favor?
Trump’s case: ""Last weeks [sic] Job’s Report was RIGGED, just like the numbers prior to the Presidential Election were Rigged. That’s why, in both cases, there was massive, record setting revisions, in favor of the Radical Left Democrats. Those big adjustments were made to cover up, and level out, the FAKE political numbers that were CONCOCTED in order to make a great Republican Success look less stellar!!! I will pick an exceptional replacement.""

Millions of business decisions are made based on the jobs number being a fair and reasonable estimate, based on Labor’s survey of participating companies.
But let’s pull back and look at some other recent Trump actions.
The Office of Special Counsel is now investigating Jack Smith, who brought two criminal cases against Trump, for violating the Hatch Act. That’s the law that bars government officials from making blatantly partisan comments. But it’s usually ignored: When Kellyanne Conway was accused of violating the act and recommended for dismissal, Trump just blew it off.
Ex-CIA director John Brennan and fired FBI chief James Comey are under criminal investigation for allegedly politicizing intelligence in 2016.
DOJ CRIMINALLY INVESTIGATING FORMER OBAMA OFFICIALS FOR HANDLING OF RUSSIA PROBE
Trump has also ordered a criminal probe of Barack Obama for his actions in 2016 and declared him guilty of ""treason.""
I’d just offer a reminder that Trump’s special counsel in the first term, John Durham, investigated all this and brought no charges against these men.
I know that his files have recently been declassified, but Durham wrote:
""The office’s best assessment is that the July 25 and July 27 emails that purport to be from Benardo,"" a man funded by George Soros, ""were ultimately a composite of several emails that were obtained throughRussian intelligence hackingof the U.S.-based thinktanks."" Durham indicted only three minor officials.

Trump is extremely aggressive, of course, whether it’s suing the media (winning $16-million settlements from ABC and CBS); targetingIvy League universities(Columbia agreeing to pay a $200-million penalty); ordering an investigation of first-term cybersecurity official Miles Taylor (better known as Anonymous); ordering federal agencies to cut ties with WilmerHale (and saying it was because Robert Mueller worked there), along with defunding NPR and PBS.
Oh, and did I mention that the current president has also ordered an investigation of pardons and other actions by Joe Biden, aimed at showing he was too mentally impaired to do the job? The former president, who is being treated for prostate cancer, dismissed the idea as ""ridiculous.""

All this projects an image of strength, enabling Trump to drive the news agenda. But it also reveals a president preoccupied by past grievances and determined to settle scores with opponents he believes unfairly targeted him.
And that’s why Erika McEntarfer is suddenly out of a job.

PresidentDonald Trump'sglobal reset of trade relationships will remain in the spotlight this week as his administration moves forward with sweeping new taxes on imports.
The White House said last week that the new tariff rates, originally slated to take effect Aug. 1, will come into force on Thursday in order to give U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials additional time to prepare to collect theduties.
WHERE TRUMP'S TARIFFS STAND NOW AND THE WINDING ROAD THAT LED US HERE

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-taking-decisive-action-bring-critical-industry-back-american-soil,Trump is taking decisive action to bring this critical industry back to American soil,"White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro discusses whether he believes President Donald Trump’s tariffs policies will hold up in court on ‘The Will Cain Show.’
After an exhaustive investigation by the Department of Commerce under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act, President Trump isimposing significant tariffson imported copper. This critical material is as essential now to America’s economic and national security as oil, electricity, and semiconductors.
Indeed, in an era defined by artificial intelligence, grid modernization, and advanced computing, copper has become indispensable for technological innovation and defense. Our military systems—from aircraft and submarines to advanced weaponry—rely heavily on copper, as do essential civilian sectors, including the electrical grid, telecommunications networks, and cutting-edge manufacturing.
Despite copper’s strategic importance, America’s copper industry continues to behollowed outby unfair foreign trade practices—including state-subsidized overcapacity and below-cost dumping by countries like China, Vietnam, and India to export manipulation and predatory pricing by countries like Chile, Peru, and Mexico. These practices, often violating WTO rules, depress global copper prices and discourage investment in domestic smelting and refining facilities. Combined with burdensome domestic regulations, this has left America dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal critical to our defense and economic security.
MORNING GLORY: PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE UNITED STATES’ MASSIVE TARIFF HAUL IN HIS FIRST SIX MONTHS BACK
Once a global leader in copper mining, refining, and manufacturing, the U.S. now faces a perilous dependence on imports. Our refining capacity alone has declined by 56 percent since the late 1990s, forcing us into the absurd position of exporting raw copper ore and scrap overseas, only to re-import finished products. This isn’t merely inefficient—it’s strategically reckless.
The trade deficit in copper-intensive downstream products underscores our vulnerability. Between 2010 and 2024, this deficit surged from $4.8 billion to a staggering $19.4 billion, a 302 percent increase. Last year alone, America imported nearly a million metric tons of refined copper to meet basic domestic needs. Every pound of copper imported is a pound we could and should be processing right here at home, creating American jobs andsecuring our supply chains.
This troubling dependence is compounded by global overcapacity in copper refining, predominantly fueled by state-subsidized overproduction abroad. The result? America has become dangerously reliant on foreign sources for a metal integral to our defense and economic security.
To address this threat, President Trump, acting decisively under Section 232 authority, has imposed tariffs designed to rebuild and safeguard America’s copper supply chains. Specifically, the President is implementing an immediate 50 percent tariff on imported semi-finished copper products and intensive copper derivative products. Additionally, refined copper imports will face a phased tariff—starting at 15 percent in 2027 and increasing to 30 percent in 2028. These measured steps will provide critical breathing room for U.S. companies to ramp up domestic refining and processing capabilities.
Trump Tariff ""panicans"" will inevitably complain about costs and economic disruption. But let’s be clear: these tariffs represent amodest and necessary premiumcompared to the enormous risks posed by continued dependence on foreign copper.
We've learned from prior Section 232 actions on steel and aluminum that tariffs can successfully revitalize critical industries. Those actions attracted billions of dollars in new investment, restored domestic capacity, created thousands of jobs, and secured crucial materials for our military and infrastructure.
The tariffs on copper will yield similar results. They will catalyze the revival of domestic refining and smelting capabilities, incentivize investment in new technologies, and put Americans back to work in states across our great land producing the copper we desperately need.
The United States holds abundant copper reserves—enough to fully meet domestic demand for approximately 40 years. Arizona alone hosts some of the country's largest deposits, including the Morenci mine, one of North America's most productive copper sources.
Revitalizing America’s copper industry means revitalizing American communities. From copper mines in Arizona and Montana to smelters and processing plants in Utah, Texas, and Indiana, these tariffs will help create thousands of high-paying, blue-collar jobs. Investments will flow into exploration, refining, and downstream manufacturing—boosting local economies and rebuilding the industrial heartland. This is economic nationalism for national security’s sake.

In an era defined by strategic competition and supply chain vulnerabilities, we cannot afford passive reliance on foreign producers who harm our country with their massive exports. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed thecritical risksof relying on foreign supply chains, underscoring the need to strengthen domestic production capabilities for strategic materials like copper.
These new Trump copper tariffs will help reduce America's persistent trade deficit and safeguard our economy against dangerous supply interruptions during geopolitical tensions or future global crises. Domestic production of critical materials like copper is not just sound economics; it’s imperative to maintain our sovereignty and security.

America's copper industry—and the American workers who sustain it—have waited far too long for decisive action. By invoking Section 232, President Trump is taking exactly that kind of decisive, bold action to put American security first.
President Trump’s message is clear: the United States will no longer tolerate economic policies that hollow out our industries and jeopardize national security. With these copper tariffs, we're taking a critical step to protect our economy, rebuild our industry, and ensure our national security.

""The highest since the 1930s up from, get, this just 2% last year. As I'm going to talk about in this segment, I can't think of a more influential president during this century, and it starts here with tariffs. He said he was going to raise tariffs, and despite the claims otherwise, he is in fact doing that. The effective tariff rate at this point looks to be nine times as high as it was last year. The highest since the 90s,"" Enten said.
Trump is increasing thetariff on Canada from 25% to 35%beginning on Friday, after the Trump administration said the neighbor to the north failed to help curb the imports of fentanyl and other illicit drugs.

The White House noted that Trump signed an executive order on Thursday to increase the tariff in an effort tohold Canada accountablefor its role in the flow of illicit drugs into the U.S. Additionally,Trump signed another executive orderon the same day to modify the reciprocal tariff rates for some countries to further address the United States’ trade deficits.
The action reflects Trump’s effortsto protect the U.S. from foreign threats to national security and the economy by securing ""fair, balanced and reciprocal trade relationships,"" the White House said.
Enten said that Trump's immigration policies factor into Trump's significant influence as well.

CNN data Harry Enten said Saturday that President Donald Trump is the most influential president this century.
""It is not the only way that Trump is remaking America. What are we talking about? Well, let's jump. The other big thing that Trump ran on wasimmigration. How about net migration in the United States? Get this, it's down. It's going to be down at least 60%. We may be dealing with, get this, negative net migration to the United States in 2025,"" Enten said.
He continued, ""That would be the first time there is negative net migration in this country in at least 50 years. We're talking about down from 2.8 million in 2024. So Donald Trump has always run on tariffs, and he's running a hawkish line on immigration. And on both of those issues we are seeing record high tariff rates for this century going all the way back, well back into the early part of the 20th century. And when it comes to immigration, net migration We are seeing record low levels way down from where we were during the Biden administration.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/feds-foolish-interest-rate-policy-stopping-americas-economy-from-booming,The Fed’s foolish interest rate policy is stopping America’s economy from booming,"FOX Business host Charles Payne weighs in on the impact of the Federal Reserve refusing to lower interest rates on ‘Special Report.’
The Federal ReserveannouncedWednesday, July 30, that it is leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged, at a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The decision is extremely foolish.
By keeping rates at a comparatively high level, relative to the average rate over the past two decades, the Fed is unnecessarily suppressingeconomic growthand making it harder for consumers and businesses to finance debt. Moreover, the unemployment rate rose in July to 4.2%, marking an uptick from June and underscoring that the labor market is cooling, and the economy is in need of support.
The federal funds rate — the interest rate at which depository institutions lend reserve balances to each other overnight — is a powerful tool used by the Federal Reserve to influence U.S. economic activity. Changes to this rate ripple throughout the economy, affecting borrowing costs, consumer behavior, and, ultimately, the broader business cycle.
BACK FROM SCOTLAND, TRUMP ENTERS CRUCIAL TRADE WEEK AND EYES FED'S DECISION ON RATE CUTS
Higher rates mean it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow money overnight. This cost is often passed on to consumers and businesses through higher interest rates on loans and credit.
Critics are calling out Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates. FILE: Powell testifies during a House Oversight and Reform Select Subcommittee hearing on the Coronavirus crisis, on Capitol Hill in Washington, June 22, 2021.(Graeme Jennings/Pool via REUTERS)
When the Fed lowers the funds rate, borrowing becomes cheaper, and this generally stimulates more economic activity.
Most analysts believe that the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates high, relative to the average rate over the past 15 years, is being driven by fear.Fed Chairman Jerome Powelland some of the other leaders at the central bank say that if they lower interest rates,inflationwill surge, driving up already high costs on goods and services across the economy.
GOOD ECONOMIC DATA IS BAD NEWS FOR TRUMP’S INTEREST RATE PUSH
However, the best evidence tells a very different story.
First of all, there currently is no inflation crisis.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in July that the consumer price index — one of the most popular measures of inflation — increased in June by 2.7% compared to one year prior.
Although the CPI in June was slightly higher than the CPI recorded in May (2.4%), both months remained below the levels recorded in December 2024 (2.9%) and January 2025 (3%). Additionally, inflation has leveled off substantially from where it was during much ofJoeBiden’spresidency.
Second, historical data and recent experience show that the Fed’s view of inflation and interest rates is completely misguided. The Fed’s benchmark rate is not a significant factor in causing or preventing inflation.
TRUMP’S HOUSING CHIEF RIPS POWELL FOR BLOWING MILLIONS ON FED FACELIFT DURING HOUSING CRISIS HE PERPETUATES
For example, during President Barack Obama’s eight years in office, the Fed’s benchmark interest rate was extremely low, consistently less than 1%. Yet, inflation was also extremely low, even during years in which the economy added a significant number of jobs.
Most analysts believe that the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates high, relative to the average rate over the past 15 years, is being driven by fear.
Notably, during President Donald Trump’s first term, the Federal Reserve increased interest rates substantially — though not nearly as high as they are now — and inflation remained relatively the same as it had been under much of Obama’s term.
These are not exceptions to the rule. A review of data over the past half-century shows there’s no strong correlation between the Fed’s interest rate and inflation.
FEDERAL RESERVE LEAVES INTEREST RATES UNCHANGED
That doesn’t mean interest rates are irrelevant, or that they should be at or near zero. Keeping interest rates too low over a long period can create significant unintended consequences, such as encouraging increases in public and private debt. But the idea that Powell and his pals at the Fed are staving off an inflation crisis by keeping rates high is delusional.
All that the Fed is achieving by refusing to cut rates — even by just half a percentage point — is making it costlier for everyone to finance debt. This has enormous economic implications, especially for businesses wanting to expand and families looking to buy or sell a home, car, or another high-priced item.

The Fed’s decision to keep rates high is, by design, keeping America’s economy from booming.
If the Fed’s benchmark interest rate isn’t the most important factor when considering inflation, then what is? The answer is, it all depends on the circumstances.
SEN RAND PAUL: THERE ARE $186 BILLION REASONS WHY WE MUST AUDIT THE FED
Inflation occurs when the prices of goods and services across the economy rise, making your money worth less than it was before. One common cause is when people are spending a lot and demand for things like food, housing, or cars increases faster than companies can supply them. When this happens, businesses often raise prices because they know customers are willing to pay more.
Another cause is when it becomes more expensive for businesses to produce goods. If wages go up, raw materials cost more, or energy becomes pricier, companies may pass those extra costs on to consumers by raising prices.
Inflation can also happen when there’s a large increase in the amount of money circulating in the economy. If the government prints a lot of money or spends heavily without matching production, the value of money can fall. When each dollar buys less than before, prices rise to make up the difference.
TRUMP IS CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE FED IS MANAGED MORE THAN ABOUT FIRING POWELL, SAYS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF
During the Biden presidency, all these things occurred. Biden and his Democratic allies in Congress spent obscene amounts of money, imposed policies that sent energy prices skyrocketing, increased regulatory burdens on businesses, and discouraged people from working by hooking millions on government programs.

Additionally, COVID-19 lockdowns, Russia’s war in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East raised uncertainty and, in some cases, severely impacted supply chains, raising prices on a long list of goods and services.
But now, the lockdowns are over, supply chains and markets have adjusted to the recent international turmoil, investment in America is on rise, and people are back to work.
The Fed’s decision to keep rates high is, by design, keeping America’s economy from booming.
There’s simply no reason to believe that a modest interest rate cut would cause inflation to increase dramatically, if at all.

Why, then, are Powell and the other Fed governors keeping rates higher than needed? Perhaps it’s because they don’t like the president. Or maybe it’s because they don’t understand what truly causes inflation.
Either way, it seems apparent that a change in leadership is desperately needed at America’s central bank.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/im-gen-z-many-my-generation-lost-faith-american-dream-prove-them-wrong,I'm Gen Z and many in my generation lost faith in the American Dream. Prove them wrong,"Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., joined 'MediaBuzz' to discuss why the Democratic Party's approval is dwindling as it struggles to identify a new strategy.
Gen Z is on the verge of opting out. Not out of laziness — out of disillusionment. We’ve inherited a roadmap that no longer leads anywhere, and for many of us, the American Dream feels more like a bedtime story than a blueprint for life.
I know this because I almost walked away from it too. But I didn’t. And now I’m building the tools to make sure others don’t have to.
I’m 23 years old, a first-generation American. My parents came here fromChinain the late ’90s, carrying little more than hope and an oversized suitcase. They believed — maybe more than anything — that hard work meant opportunity. They didn’t have much, but they had that belief. And through discipline and what I now recognize as unimaginable sacrifice, they carved out a life that gave me the freedom to dream bigger than they ever could.
THE AMERICAN DREAM SLIPS FURTHER AWAY AS YOUNGER ADULTS RETREAT TO PARENTS' HOMES
That dream led me to pave my own way. I started investing in 2nd grade with a custodian account I begged my parents to open. I dropped out of high school to build and sell my first company, a virtual reality startup.
I then found myself starting Harvard at the height of the pandemic. From my dorm room, I participated in theCOVID investing boom-- memestocks, crypto, super-star fund managers… I embraced it all. And the eventual collapse of the mania inspired me to take action. I dropped out to builddub, a fintech platform to help all Americans invest with more clarity and confidence.
In many ways, I’m living proof that the American Dream is still possible. But I know I’m an outlier. And unless we make bold changes — fast — my generation will stop believing it’s even worth trying.
We recently partnered with Harris Poll to ask Americans how they really feel about their financial future. What we found is sobering.Sixty percentof Gen Z no longer believe a traditional 9-to-5 job will get them to their financial goals.Forty-threepercent say side hustles are essential.Forty-onepercent believe you have to be an entrepreneur just to make it. And something that hit me hard: only abouthalfof Gen Z still sees owning a home as a meaningful financial milestone.
For many of us, success isn’t a white picket fence. It’s paying off debt. Supporting our parents. Having breathing room. The old roadmap — graduate, get a job, buy a house — sounds like fiction in today’s economy.
I’m living proof that the American Dream is still possible. But I know I’m an outlier. And unless we make bold changes — fast — my generation will stop believing it’s even worth trying.
This isn’t laziness. It’s adaptation. We’re rising costs, shrinking wages, and an education system that never taught us how money works. We’re the ""FinTok Generation"" —62%of us turn to social media for financial advice. Not because it’s ideal — but because it’s all we’ve got. We didn’t grow up with financial advisors. So we take what we can get — TikToks, Reddit threads, group chats.
NEW STUDY REVEALS THREATS TO THE CLASS OF 2025. FIXING THEM SHOULD BE JOB NO. 1 FOR AMERICA
And we’re not just passively watching.Sixty percentof Gen Z is already investingoutside of retirement accounts. Sixty-five percent believe that’s our best shot at building wealth. But only 17% of Americans say they actually feel confident in how the stock market works. We’re out here trying. But we’re often guessing.
And the tools we’re using? A mixed bag.Seventy-twopercent of Americans believe fintech has made investing more accessible — and it has. But too many of those platforms profit off confusion. They push people toward options trades, meme stocks, FOMO bets. That’s not investing. That’s gambling in a suit.
I builtdubto flip that script. Instead of blindly investing, dub lets users copy the trades of real investors with real investing strategies. No hype. No TikTok influencers peddling the next billion dollar meme coin. Just transparency, long-term investing, and real expertise. And it only takes $100 to start.
We’re actually not re-inventing the wheel. We’re democratizing what the wealthy already have: access to expertise. Rich people don’t DIY their investments — they hire fancy wealth managers and invest with elite hedge funds. We’re making that experience available for all Americans. You no longer need wealth to build wealth. Anyone can now outsource the hard work of investing in a single tap.
HOUSING CRISIS DEEPENS AS 47 MAJOR METRO AREAS NOW REQUIRE HOMEBUYERS TO SPEND MORE THAN 30% OF INCOME
But this isn’t just about dub. It’s a wake-up call to every company building for Gen Z.
We’re tired of being monetized to the brink. Tired of platforms profiting from the very confusion they create. Tired of watching tools that could empower our generation instead exploit us for short-term gains.
It’s why I built dub: to prove that mission-driven companies can create a brighter, more optimistic future — not just for shareholders, but for entire generations. If even 1% of Americans learn to invest better, we begin to show that anyone, from any background, can participate in the greatest wealth engine ever created: the American stock market.
Why do I call out other industry leaders? Because I’ve lived the alternative. My family came to Detroit with $10,000 a year and lived in section 8 housing — and today, I’m building one of the fastest-growing investing platforms inNew York City.
That’s the American Dream. And it shouldn’t stop with me.

But to keep it alive, we need to build differently. We need to stop creating products that amplify the worst of human nature and profit off the confusion of my generation. We need tools that give Gen Z a reason to believe again — in the system, in themselves, and in the future of this country.
We’re redefining the Dream. I’m here to lead the way. But I can’t do it alone.
Here’s how we unlock the American Dream for Gen Z in 2025.
1. Build the right tools. Tech companies must stop profiting off risky behavior. Build tools that feel native to Gen Z, but nudge us toward long-term investing, not YOLO bets.
2. Teach financial literacy like it’s life or death — because it is. Start from the moment our children can read. Teach compounding. Teach ownership. Teach debt and credit. These are not electives. They’re survival skills.
3. Make ownership the new norm. Let every American feel — not just hear — that they’re part of this country’s wealth engine. When we own a piece of innovation, we believe in its future.
If Gen Z stops believing in the American Dream, we don’t just lose a generation. We lose the future of this country. But I believe we’re not beyond repair.

When Gen Z sees a real path — we take it. We grind. We build. We help each other up. But if the path stays hidden or rigged, we’ll stop walking it altogether. And we’ll build a different one instead.

EXCLUSIVE:North Carolina'sstate auditor said he is looking forward to making a positive impact on taxpayers by implementing a state version of Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, North Carolina state auditor Dave Boliek said his office would look into how the state government can be more efficient and utilize the resources it has in the ""best possible way"" for taxpayers. He plans on doing that through House Bill 125, a state-level DOGE initiative named after him that recently passed the legislature.
""It helps to give our office and the state auditor's office more resources to take a look at efficiencies and ways to really drill down on determining a good return on investment of taxpayer dollars across North Carolina,"" Boliek said.
""I really support the effort,"" he said, in part. ""We've got the team in place, and we've got the ability to really get effective results.""
DOGE PREPARES TO LITERALLY DRAIN THE SWAMP BY BANISHING BIDEN'S 'OVERREACHING' WATER RULE
North Carolina state auditor Dave Boliek said he is looking forward to ""keeping government accountable"" by cutting wasteful spending through a state form of DOGE.(Getty Images)
The bill includes a provision for the state auditor to establish a Division of Accountability, Value and Efficiency, otherwise known as the DAVE Act. The billpassed the legislaturelast week with bipartisan support – a 91-23 vote in the House and a 47-2 vote in the Senate.
The measure now sits at Gov. Josh Stein's desk, and while it is unclear if he will sign the measure into law, the ability to override a potential veto is there with a Republican majority in both chambers and enough Democrat support.
""It will become law. I'm very confident that it will,"" Boliek said.
Boliek explained that his office will be taking a ""data-driven approach"" to determining the best ""return on investment in taxpayer dollars."" He also said his office will look across the entire state government to identify where it can be more efficient rather than focusing on specific key areas.
""I think it'd be unfair to sort of pick out one specific area where we see cuts are necessary because we haven't taken that deep dive yet, but we are going to use modern computer programs, we're going to use AI and we're going to use a lot of data analysis to come up with solid common-sense recommendations,"" he said.

Boliek said the legislature has asked for open positions in the state to be examined to determine why the roles are unfilled and, if necessary, what needs to happen in order to fill them.
""I don't think we're limited to just looking at cutting only. There may be areas where the state is responsible for serving citizens, and we're not putting in enough resources. The legislature has been very clear about giving us that freedom to take a look at those areas as well, like where we are underfunding certain things,"" Boliek added.
When asked about areas theTrump administrationfocused on with DOGE that Boliek could continue with at the state level, he said he wants to pursue initiatives in a data-driven way to ensure his office is backing up its recommendations for cuts or enhancements with ""solid data"" and ""not just a feeling.""
""The approach should be to take a look at how taxpayer dollars are being spent and ask ‘what is the return on investment?’ If we're spending tax dollars on a specific program, the real question is what kind of return are taxpayers getting for that amount of money? And that, I think, will drive decisions on recommendations,"" he said.
DOGE REVEALS WHAT YOU GET FOR THE HALF MILLION YOU'LL PAY IN TAXES OVER YOUR LIFETIME
Boliek said ""taking a look at how dollars are appropriated is really important"" and he pointed out the need for ""relief-type bills,"" including for hurricane relief following the devastation left in the state last year byHurricane Helene.
""It's one thing to expend money and appropriate money, it's another thing to appropriate money with some measurables,"" he said. ""That's really going to be key to us being able to be the most efficient. The auditor's office here in North Carolina is well situated to assist with the monitoring of measurables on the expense of appropriated dollars.""

As he awaits official enactment of the DAVE Act, Boliek said it is an ""exciting time"" for his office to be able to have a ""real effect"" on everyday Americans in the Tar Heel State.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/buy-now-pay-later-worst-thing-consumers-since-payday-loans,"Buy now, pay later is the worst thing for consumers since payday loans","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
We’re living in a time when you can finance pizza. Where $100 jeans can be split into four easy payments. Where ""zero interest"" sounds like free money. But behind the buzzwords and flashy apps, Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) is turning into one of the most financially destructive forces in America.
What started as a clever tech innovation to help people ""manage cash flow"" has become a full-blown debt trap — one that’s quietly ruining the financial health of working families across the country. BNPL is marketed like a budgeting hack, but it’s really the worst thing that’s happened to consumers since paydayloans.
Let’s cut through the hype and look at the facts. According to a 2023 report by TransUnion, BNPL usage soared 43% in a single year. Roughly 40% of users have missed at least one payment, and those missed payments often come with hefty late fees or aggressive collections. A 2023 CFPB report indicates that amongconsumersin households charged an insufficient funds (NSF) fee in the past year, 85% were also charged an overdraft fee.
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS DISCOVER THE BIG SECRET ABOUT CONSUMER FINANCIAL PROTECTION
Meanwhile, Americans are already up to their eyeballs in other forms of debt.Credit card balanceshave now hit an all-time high of $1.12 trillion, according to theFederal Reserve Bankof New York. Auto loan delinquencies are rising fast — over 7.6% of borrowers are 30 days past due, the highest level in over a decade. And since the federalstudent loan pauseended, more than 40% of borrowers haven’t resumed payments. We’ve built a nation that’s not just living paycheck to paycheck — it’s now borrowing paycheck to paycheck.
Buy now, pay later introduces a whole new type of borrowing where consumers borrow in their day-to-day lives, not for big items.
And BNPL is pouring gasoline on that fire.
Here’s why it’s so dangerous: it doesn’t feel like debt. When you swipe acredit card,you know you’re borrowing. When you click ""pay later"" on a website, it feels like nothing happened. But something did happen — you took out a loan.
MAGA COUNTRY VOTERS SOUND ALARM OVER ‘RIDICULOUS’ NATIONAL DEBT AMID DEBATE OVER TRUMP-BACKED BILL
And instead of thinking about the total cost, consumers focus on the $25-a-week illusion. It’s predatory because it masks the risk. It convinces people they can afford things they absolutely cannot.
I’m seeing it firsthand in conversations across the country: People don’t even realize how many plans they’ve signed up for. Klarna here. Afterpay there. Affirm on something else. According to industry data, the average BNPL user has four to six active plans — but most couldn’t tell you the total amount they owe.
And it’s not just big-ticket items like laptops or furniture anymore. People are now financing gas, groceries and takeout. Think about that: We’re borrowing money to buy things that are gone in a week.  Even short-term loans to make it to our next paycheck.
This isn’t just financially unsound — it’s culturally dangerous. BNPL is normalizing the idea that you deserve to have something now and worry about paying for it later. It’s instant gratification on steroids. It’s teaching young people that budgeting means stacking multiple payment plans — not actually saving money.
INVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES
You know what system worked better when I was growing up? Layaway. That’s right — good, old-fashioned, unglamorous layaway. You saw something you wanted. You made small payments. And only after you paid in full did you walk out the door with the item. No debt. No fees. No collections. Layaway required patience. It taught discipline. It was about saving before you spent.

BNPL flips that on its head. It removes friction. It encourages consumption without consequence. Retailers love it because it boosts sales. Tech companies love it because it boosts engagement. But the American consumer? They’re the ones stuck holding the bag when all those ""easy payments"" come due at once.  It’s the same trap as payday loans, just with better branding.
And instead of thinking about the total cost, consumers focus on the $25-a-week illusion. It’s predatory because it masks the risk. It convinces people they can afford things they absolutely cannot.
Even regulators are waking up. TheConsumer Financial Protection Bureauhas flagged BNPL for deceptive practices, lack of transparency and the use of consumerdata for marketing.But they’re behind the curve. This market has already ballooned to $80 billion in annual transactions—and it’s only getting bigger.
So, what’s the solution?
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
We need to go back to basics. We need to teach people to save before they spend. It’s called delayed gratification and people in America just don’t understand this concept anymore. We need to stop pretending that BNPL is some kind of harmless financial tool. It’s the fast track to delinquency and bankruptcy for people who can least afford it.
And maybe, just maybe, we need to bring back the layaway counter at your local department store. Because the lesson there was simple but powerful: If you can’t pay for it today, wait until you can. That’s how wealth is built — not through apps, not through gimmicks, and certainly not through ""four easy payments.""

The Chicago Tribune warned on Thursday that Mayor Brandon Johnson’s progressive policy proposals may scare businesses away from the already struggling city.
As officials anticipate a$1.2 billion deficit,Johnson spoke to reporters on Tuesday about his plans to fix the local economy, particularly how the ""billionaires and ultra-rich"" can have ""more skin in the game.""
""Everything has to be on the table. Everything has to be on the table,"" Johnson said of his plans. The Chicago Tribune, whichhas criticized Johnson before,warned this does not bode well for the local economy.
In a piece headlined, ""Mayor Johnson offers multiple ideas to scare businesses out of Chicago,"" the newspaper's editorial board outlined how ""Halloween comes early with Johnson’s ‘progressive revenue’ specifics.""

""Among the possibilities the mayor said 'have to be on the table': reviving the corporate head tax; imposing a thinly disguised corporate income tax; and 'asking' universities, endowments and other large-scale nonprofits to pay substantial sums in lieu of the property taxes from which they are shielded,""The Tribune said.
The editorial board singled out the head tax as a particularly disastrous policy. The policy, which ""Mayor Rahm Emanuel rightly killed in 2014,"" is one where businesses are taxed based on how many employees they have. The board argued such a policy ""is a disincentive to hire people,"" particularly amid the emerges of new technologies.
""With the rise inartificial intelligence, companies nationwide already are laying off workers who are performing functions corporate leaders believe AI can do instead. If Johnson truly wants to jump-start AI-induced white-collar employment losses in Chicago, there are few more effective ways than bringing back the head tax,"" The Tribune warned.
But beyond ill-advised policy, the outlet highlighted one proposal it claims claim Johnson does not even have the right to enforce.
""That leaves a more pernicious proposal pushed by the nonprofit Institute for the Public Good, which has a representative on the mayor’s working group,"" The Tribune reported. ""Based on a tax Seattle approved several years ago, that group has floated an ‘excise tax’ on payrolls for those making $200,000 or more (including stock options and various forms of noncash compensation) — meant to substitute for a corporate income tax that Chicago doesn’t have the legal authority to impose.""

The piece warned that across the multiple policies he proposed, ""By once again focusing only on economically destructive taxes that we’re guessing won’t get far with skittish aldermen afraid to tie their political futures to a deeply unpopular mayor, Johnson risks a reprise of last year’s eleventh-hour budget crisis.""
Another aspect pointed out by the Chicago Tribune is that Johnson laid out these and other policy proposals long before his working group will discuss them at an upcoming meeting in August, a key detail which the Tribune suggested speaks volumes about his leadership.
""By saying he’s on board with several highly controversial tax proposals before his group even weighs in, Johnson now has confirmed, at least in the minds of his numerous skeptics, that the exercise always was little more than window dressing for an administration bent on doing what it has wanted to do from the start — soak the ‘rich’ in order to bankroll an ever-growing government apparatus,"" The Tribune wrote.

In many ways, the Founding Fathers were the original civil servants. They were the start-up founders who inspired generations to work on behalf of the American dream long before there was an institutionalized civil service – later formalized by thePendleton Civil Service Act of 1883and bolstered by Theodore Roosevelt’s leadership as commissioner of the U.S. Civil Service Commission (the modern predecessor of today’s Office of Personnel Management, which I have the privilege to lead).
Across two and a half centuries since our nation’s founding, public servants have heeded the clarion call of the noblest of missions: from forming our nation after the American Revolution to ultimately cementing our supremacy during the Cold War by literally shooting for the moon via the Apollo program. These bold entreaties inspired the nation's best and brightest to embrace public service.

For over 50 years since the Apollo landing, however, the public’s interest incivil servicehas plummeted back down to earth. Many Founding Fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin were polymaths who chose to focus their genius on creating the best government the world had ever seen. But if Alexander Hamilton, our first Treasury secretary, were alive today, he likely would be working in Silicon Valley or Wall Street, instead of in the federal government.

First, the mission – since the days of moonshots, the federal workforce has not been asked to ""dream big"" or innovate. Instead, they have been tasked with managing small problems, preserving the status quo and protecting against the downside at all costs.
Second, incentives – power and prestige derive from the size of an agency’s headcount and budget. In all cases, more is better.

Third, the lack of a high-performance culture – a focus on equity over merit and job stability over accountability.
Fourth, treating technology as a second-class citizen – instead, the answer to most problems has been more headcount.
Fifth, an arms-length relationship with the private sector that fails to create partnership, particularly when it comes to attracting talent in critical areas.

First, Trump has no shortage of moonshots to transform America’s economic future – winning in artificial intelligence, unleashing American energy, revolutionizing financial technology with cryptocurrencies, reindustrializing the heartland, making America healthy again, and the list goes on. Inspiring missions inspire great minds who want to be a part of something truly transformational.

Second, changing the incentives that ultimately drive civil service behavior. If we give employees permission to take ""measured"" risks, to think from first principles, to be willing to pilot new ideas with the understanding that we won’t score a 100%, to make operational efficiency and stewardship of taxpayer dollars a first-class citizen, we can change behavior. Let’s reward creativity, continuous improvement and doing more with less; power should no longer derive from organizational bloat, but rather from financially sound outcomes.
Third, we can create a high-performance culture. We must disproportionately reward those who create the most value for the taxpayer and remove employees from the organization who aren’t able to respond to performance improvement guidance. No more ""peanut buttering"" of annual evaluations and bonuses to achieve equity goals; we should instead demand excellence.
But if Alexander Hamilton, our first Treasury secretary, were alive today, he likely would be working in Silicon Valley or Wall Street, instead of in the federal government.
Fourth, make the adoption of technology a key tenet of success. The government should be a leading testing ground for new technologies, rather than the last bastion of mainframe computers. Eliminate the ""not invented here"" bias that pervades government adoption of technology; we don’t need to build bespoke applications when third parties have superior solutions.

Lastly,embrace the private sectorto partner on talent. We can build out public-private exchanges, secondment opportunities, and higher education pathways to ensure that the government gets access to the best and brightest. Of course, many people may ultimately choose to spend the majority of their careers in the private sector, but they can still contribute to success in the public sector.
President Trump is ushering in aGolden Age for Americaby reforming the government bureaucracy to work for the American people. We will make the civil service great again. The future of our nation depends on it.

All across Europe, officials in popularvacation destinationshave been grappling with the ravages of overtourism — prompting locals to speak out about the strain this has taken on their communities.
Last year, over three million people traveled to Paris, France, to witness the 2024 Olympic Games.
About 230,000 Americans attended the Olympics, accounting for the largest group of foreign visitors, according to the official website Paris je t'aime.

Paris officialssay 2025 may rank as one of the busiest years yet, as there is a 20% rise in January bookings compared to last year, Reuters reported.
Montmartre resident Anne Renaudi has lived in the area for 29 years. She told Reuters a historic section of the city now looks like a theme park after it was made famous in the movie ""Amelie.""
""People come for three hours, have fun, buy a beret or a crêpe, and leave — as if they were in an amusement park,"" said Renaudie.

The group has looked at limiting tour groups to 25 people, banning loudspeakers and raising the tourist tax.
In 2024, 48.7 million visitors traveled across Paris with about 11 million of them spending time in Montmartre.
One popular landmark that tourists enjoy checking out is the 140-year-oldSacre-Coeur Basilica. It sits atop the Montmartre hill and is surrounded by narrow streets for visitors to explore.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-liberation-day-tariffs-could-hit-snag-court-today-heres-what-know,Federal judges grill Trump lawyers over 'Liberation Day' tariffs on eve of enforcement,"Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the legal uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs as countries continue to negotiate.
Eleven federal appellate judges weighed PresidentDonald Trump'suse of an emergency law to impose steep and punishing tariffs on most U.S. trading partners during nearly two hours of fast-paced oral arguments Thursday, underscoring the magnitude and urgency of the case.
At issue before the Washington-based Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is Trump’s attempt to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — a 1977 emergency law — to enact the steep import fees and impose additional tariffs on certain trading partners. Those tariffs are slated to take force Aug. 1.
Judges for the appeals court pressed administration lawyers to explain why Trump invoked IEEPA when there are other, more narrow statutes enacted by Congress to specifically deal with tariffs. These laws include certain caps on tariff amounts, they noted, as well as timeframes reviewable by Congress.
Judge Evan Wallach rattled off a list of such statutes. Compared to these, he said, IEEPA ""doesn’t include the word tariffs anywhere.""

He added that when the law was passed in 1977, tariffs were a relevant issue included in other statutes, suggesting that, had Congress intended for them to be there, they would have been.
Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate acknowledged the IEEPA law does not include the word ""tariffs."" Still, he argued that the trade deficit between the U.S. and trading partners had ""reached a tipping point,"" which he said enabled the administration to use emergency powers to take action.
""It’s affecting our military readiness,"" he told the court. ""It’s affecting our domestic manufacturing capability.""
Shumate was also asked if the administration believes that Trump's power under IEEPA is ""unbounded,"" and, if true, whether it believes the president’s actions are reviewable by the courts.
Shumate said in response he believes the administration should answer to a congressional delegation.

Arguing for the plaintiffs, Neal Katyal told the court that Trump, in invoking IEEPA, is attempting a ""breathtaking claim to power that no president has asserted in 200 years.""
""Our federal courts are powerless if the president can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, for as long as he wants, so long as he declares an emergency,"" he said.
Using the IEEPA law to enact the tariffs Trump outlined during his April 2 ""Liberation Day"" event would mark the first time in U.S. history that tariff powers would be enacted by a president in an instance not specifically delegated by Congress.
As the oral arguments came to a close, it was not immediately clear how judges on the panel would rule, though some suggested the possibility of partly upholding the lower court ruling that had blocked Trump’s use of IEEPA.
TRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY
""But IEPPA has been rarely used, hasn’t it? It’s been over 50 years since it’s been used?"" Judge Jimmie Reyna asked Shumate.
Outside the courthouse, Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield, who helped represent the 12 states suing over the plan, told Fox News Digital he expects the appeals court decision to come in weeks or months, not days, an acknowledgment that the Aug. 1 enforcement date will likely be well in the rearview when a ruling lands.
Still, he said, ""We're optimistic based on the courtroom today that we will be successful (or) partially successful,"" he said.
""When the federal government comes in and says that [the court] has absolutely no right to review what the president does under IEEPA, you actually heard laughter in the room,"" he said, describing it as a ""flop"" that may sit poorly with the judges.
On April 2, Trump announced a 10% baseline tariff on all countries, along with higher, reciprocal tariffs targeting select nations, including China. He said the measures would address trade imbalances, reduce deficits with key trading partners and boost domestic manufacturing and production.
However, whether emergency tariffs are the appropriate vehicle to accomplish this is an open question and one central to Thursday's oral arguments before the appeals court.
Plaintiffs inV.O.S. Selections Inc. v. Trump argued Thursday that the looming tariffs have already introduced confusion and volatility into markets, threatening the bottom lines of small U.S. businesses and making it difficult for owners to operate under shifting guidance that seems to change on a whim.
Others argue the tariffs are more a negotiating tool designed to bring trading partners to the table to negotiate new deals.
JUDGES V. TRUMP: HERE ARE THE KEY COURT BATTLES HALTING THE WHITE HOUSE AGENDA

Despite trade advisor Peter Navarro's pledge to strike ""90 trade agreements in 90 days"" and Trump'sassertionto Time magazine that it had struck ""over 200 deals"" this year, the Trump administration has in fact inked just eight such agreements over the last 120 days.
The agreements announced by the U.S. include deals with the European Union's 27-member bloc, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Japan and others.
The U.S. and China, which threatened each other with escalating reciprocal tariffs that climbed as high as 145%, agreed at a meeting in Geneva in May to lower tariffs through at least mid-August. Talks for a longer-term deal are ongoing.
Small businesses in the U.S. have been hit with months of ""complete uncertainty,"" Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation of the Liberty Justice Center, one of the groups representing small businesses in court, said in an interview Wednesday.
""That's largely due to the fact that the president asserts the power to impose tariffs on any country he wants, for any reason — and at any rate he wants, at any time he wants,"" Schwab said.
""So, there's no certainty on what the rate is going to be from one week to the next, and that's very difficult to do business with, when things are constantly changing.""
Judges on a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of International Tradevoted unanimouslyto block Trump's tariffs from taking force earlier this year, ruling that, as commander in chief, Trump does not have ""unbounded authority"" to impose tariffs under the emergency law.
That ruling was later paused by the appeals court in Washington, D.C., which agreed to consider the administration's request for relief.
Ahead of Thursday's oral arguments, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi vowed lawyers would continue to defend the president's trade agenda in court.
""This morning, [Justice Department] attorneys are going to court to defend President Trump’s tariffs, which are transforming the global economy, protecting our national security and addressing the consequences of our exploding trade deficit,"" she said. ""We will continue to defend the president.""

Some Trump supporters have argued the tariffs are merely a negotiating tactic to getforeign governmentsto the table, though the administration has repeatedly vowed to use ""all tools"" at its disposal to advance Trump's protectionist policies.
The administration argued in a court filing that the IEEPA is the law that Congress passed in 1977 to allow the president to respond to ""unusual and extraordinary threats"" and in cases where a national emergency has already been declared.
However, the plaintiffs argue that Trump’s use of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is unlawful, pointing out that, by the administration’s own admission, the deficit has persisted for nearly 50 years, undermining the claim of an ""unusual and extraordinary"" emergency.
TheCourt of Appealsfor the Federal Circuit will likely move on the case quickly, with a decision expected in August. No matter the outcome, both sides have vowed to take the fight to the Supreme Court, if necessary.
In the interim, economists noted there could be real harm the longer the court process takes.

Schwab, the lawyer helping represent the plaintiffs in court Thursday, said small business owners could see ""potentially irreparable harm"" as a result of court inaction. Already, he said Wednesday, his clients are reporting real harm.
""Some of the harm has already taken place,"" Schwab said in an earlier interview. ""And the longer it goes on, the worse it is.""

https://www.foxnews.com/media/entrepreneur-elena-cardone-left-hijacked-feminism-betrayed-women,Entrepreneur Elena Cardone says the left has hijacked feminism — and betrayed women,"CEO and realtor Elena Cardone speaks with Fox News Digital about getting involved in politics and her concerns with the feminist movement.
She intended to stay in her lane — focused on empowering women, protecting children, and strengthening families. But when those values came under attack, Elena Cardone knew she could no longer stay silent. A CEO, realtor, mom, and wife to businessman and real estate investor Grant Cardone, Elena spoke withFox News Digitalabout what inspired her to speak out.
Cardone is the CEO of 10X Ladies, which is an empowerment group designed to help women thrive in mindset, relationships, business, finance, and health,according to the website.
She also runs Cardone Mortgage, Cardone Enterprises, and Cardone Capital,alongside her husband.
Cardone, previously a Democrat and now a supporter of President Trump, wasn't always outspoken.

""As a teen, I was a rebel, I was a Democrat,"" she shared. ""I didn't understand the entrepreneurial world or how politics worked or capitalism worked or society.""
When Cardone learned more about life, she realized the Democratic Party didn't support her values.
""I was just kind of trying to be cool and what all my friends did in New Orleans and then once I really looked at what is the purpose and the message and the core values,"" she said. ""I just, I couldn't align with that group. They're just not my group.""
Cardone said she doesn't regret coming forward with herpolitical views.
She shared that she felt important parts of American society were under attack, and she couldn't stay silent any longer.
""I really previously wanted to just stay in my lane,empower women, protect children, restore the family unit. And it wasn't until those became really obviously under attack that I feel like the political world merged in and crashed into my lane so that I could no longer sit back and not speak out about it.""

As an advocate for female empowerment, the direction of the feminist movement caused concern for Cardone.
""How do you claim to be a feminist and advocate for men winning in our sports and taking our medals and robbing women of opportunities in life? That's not feminism, that's hijacking. We've worked really hard to get where we were, and we need to now fight for those rights continually.""
However, Cardone acknowledged the progress women have made regarding their rights, but voiced concern that modern feminism may negatively affect relationships.
""I feel like it put a crack and a wedge between our relationship with men as a generality, and now it's time to heal that wound and how can we come together as partners in life to work together.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-immigration-reset-lifting-wages-forcing-real-economic-reform,Trump’s immigration reset is lifting wages and forcing real economic reform,"Former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker discusses President Donald Trump’s immigration warning to Europe on ‘Fox Report.’
It’s illuminating when politicians speak the truth accidentally, letting voters know what they only say in private to their colleagues or big donors.
A video recently resurfaced of New York Democratic Rep. Yvette Clarke saying that her Brooklyn district could ""absorb a significant number of these (Haitian) migrants,"" because, she continued, ""I need more people in my district, just for redistricting purposes…"" This was about the time that former President Joe Biden’s open border policies led to ahumanitarian crisiswith 11,000 migrants crowding under a bridge connecting Texas with Mexico in the Lone Star town of Del Rio.
Ironically, Rep. Clarke’s desire for noncitizens to bolster Democrats’ political power echoes arguments made during the 1787 Constitutional Convention, when Southern delegates wanted slaves to count as a full person for purposes of representation in the U.S. House, while delegates from the North argued for slaves to not count at all. They compromised on three-fifths.
IMMIGRANTS NEEDED FOR ‘REDISTRICTING PURPOSES,' HOUSE DEM ADMITS IN VIRAL CLIP: ‘QUIET PART OUT LOUD’
Meanwhile, former community organizer, former California Assembly member, former member of Congress, and current Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass views federal enforcement of immigration laws as an existential threat to L.A. She called on ICE to end their enforcement offederal immigration lawin Los Angeles.
Bass is correct in one aspect of her fears—that President Donald J. Trump’s enforcement of U.S. laws will cause a drop in L.A.’s population. During the first Trump administration, California’s population declined due to increased immigration enforcement and the state’s draconian COVID-19 lockdown policies under Gov. Gavin Newsom. For more than 20 years, California’s high taxes and high cost of living have pushed Californians to leave the Golden State, resulting in domestic net outmigration. But California grew by a bit because there were more foreigners—legal and illegal—moving in than Californians moving out.
Bass, and others, argue that illegal immigrants do the jobs that Americans won’t do, but recent employment data says otherwise. After five years of foreign-born employment growth while the native-born lost ground, the data since Trump took office shows a reversal.
The annual increase in employment among native-born Americans shot up to over 1.7 million last month. Conversely, the number of foreign-born workers with jobs has risen less than 400,000 over that same period.
This is a stark contrast to the situation when Trump was inaugurated. In January of this year, annual job growth among foreign-born workers was almost 1.2 million higher than job growth among native-born Americans. Fast-forward to June and the situation completely reversed, with native-born Americans seeing annual employment gains of almost 1.4 million more jobs than foreign-born workers.
The better labor market for Americans, combined with low inflation, has also been driving up real wages, meaning wages adjusted for price changes. Under Biden, the average American’s weekly paycheck did rise substantially, by almost 20 percent, but prices spiked even faster. During Biden’s four years in office, real weekly paychecks bought about 4 percent less in purchasing power.
In less than half a year, Trump’s economic and immigration policies have reversed that slide, and the average American’s real weekly paycheck has risen about 1 percent. The progress is even better when looking at the real median weekly paycheck, which is higher now than at any point in the Biden administration.

For blue-collar workers who suffered so much from Bidenflation and were forced to go into debt to make ends meet, the real wage growth under Trump is a welcomed change, though it hasn’t completely erased the damage of the prior four years, as evidenced by the fact that households are still in $1.2 trillion of credit card debt.
Yet there’s more good news on the horizon, despite the doomsday predictions from today’s Democrats, who assert crops won’t be picked ifillegal aliensare deported. Ironically, Democrats made a similar assertion regarding emancipation, asserting cotton wouldn’t be picked if slaves were freed. Of course, agriculture will adapt as necessary just as it did in the nineteenth century, with automation and productivity enhancements.

In June, the United States collected $27 billion dollars intariff revenueon goods imported into the country. That number is expected to increase this month —we will know for sure in a few days. Hold on to those numbers for a bit while considering the context in which they appear.
PresidentDonald Trumpran and won in November, 2024 on a straightforward platform: Close the southern border. Prioritize the deportation of illegal migrants that are criminals or national security threats. Expand and extend the tax cuts that he initially pushed through in 2017 with the help of GOP majorities in the House and the Senate. Rollback the regulatory burden on American businesses. Rebuild the nation’s defenses through much higher defense spending. Protect girls’ and women’s sports. End the era of ""woke"" by crushing ""DEI"" and ""CRT.""
President Trump also repeatedly stated from the time he came down the escalator in 2015 that Iran would not be permitted to obtain nuclear weapons. His support for Israel has been greater than any previous president.
LIZ PEEK: TRUMP'S MAJOR TRADE WINS COULD BE ROCKET FUEL TO US ECONOMY
Trump delivered on all of these promises already. In six months. It’s a stunning and unprecedented record of achievements and of promises made and kept by a presidential candidate early in his term.
President Trump also ran onupending the international tradingsystem through the imposition of tariffs on almost every country doing business with the U.S. Skeptics of this set of claims were everywhere.
The numbers:
June’s tariff receipts in the U.S. set a monthly record of $27 billion.
July’s number is expected to increase.
""[W]e could expect that that could be well over $300 billion by the end of the year,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent declared earlier in July. (By contrast, total tariff revenue for the U.S. was $77 billion in calendar year 2024.) Bessent added that he estimates tariff revenue to the Treasury to top ""2.8 trillion over 10 years,"" ""which we think is probably low.""
In January, thefederal treasury collectedapproximately $8 billion in tariffs.  That number had more than doubled by April to $16.3 billion. The president has since concluded new tariff and trade deals with the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Indonesia, Vietnam and —this week— the European Union. Negotiations with China are ongoing and more deals with more counties are expected as Trump’s team on tariff negotiations ranges across the world accomplishing much, much more than most people thought could be accomplished this quickly.
A decade ago the U.S. collected $35 billion in tariffs annually. That’s quite a contrast: $35 billion into the U.S. treasury from tariffs in 2015; $300 billion estimated in 2025.
President Trump made no secret about hisintentions on trade. As with all the other campaign promises, he has delivered and indeed redone the vast global trading system. Thus far it has been all gain and very little pain as far as consumers and voters are concerned. Stock markets have soared in the same period with a big dip when the president announced the outlines of his ambitious trade agenda, a dip that was erased as new highs were recorded.
Now the question is: Will the skeptics of Trump’s trade policies at least consider that they were wrong?
Like most commentators, trade and tariffs have rarely been a topic for me. I began work in government in President Reagan’s administration and since then the GOP has been a ""free trade"" party. Almost every Reaganaut called themselves a devotee of ""the Chicago school"" of economics even if they were not economists. This meant, in a general way, low taxes and low-to-non-existent tariffs, and a belief in free trade around the globe via open oceans patrolled primarily by the United States Navy with help from its allies. This post-World War II international trading system was built on ""GATT.""
""GATT"" stands for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It was a multilateral agreement established in 1947 to promote international trade by reducing or eliminatingtariffsand other trade barriers between participating countries. There were eight ""rounds"" of GATT negotiations between 1947 and 1994, and they culminated in the creation of the World Trade Organization which came into being on January 1, 1995. In the 30 years since then, the ""WTO"" has set the rules and resolved the disputes among international trading partners.
At home, the Constitution vested thepower over tariffsin the Congress, but much of that power has been delegated to the president and his officials via Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Sections 201 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, and International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) of 1977. Some critics of President Trump’s big declarations and decisions on tariffs have questioned whether he has enough power under these delegations to so thoroughly transform the rules of international trade.
Suits have been filed and it will be a question of first impression for the Supreme Court if it gets there. We don’t know what tariffs will eventually come before the Court if it even agrees to take up the matter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments today in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. This is the lead case testing the president’s powers under IEEPA.
All of the countries above that have concluded new agreements with Team Trump seem to accept President Trump’s authority, but the case bears watching.
In the meantime, what are the free traders doing?
Many are issuing dire warnings about the future impacts on consumer prices and overall economic growth. Those fears have not been realized yet. In fact, GDP in Q2 of this year —the first full quarter of Trump’s second term— grew an unexpectedly robust 3.0 percent, according to the advance estimate released by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Which should mean that critics ought to at least suspend judgment for awhile and perhaps reconsider their absolute commitments to ""free trade,"" allowing for the possibility that while America willingly subsidized the world trading order for 80 years after World War II, it also possesses the power of the world’s largest economy and market and can indeed set new rules.
My perspective has changed to one of cautious approval of what President Trump is trying while remaining open to urging reversal if it doesn’t work. My evolving POV is that the U.S. has shouldered the cost of defending the freedom of the seas for eight decades and that this expensive burden will only grow in the years ahead. Tariff revenue can be seen as the trading nations of the world’s contribution to the cost of the American military.
To be specific: The ""One, Big, Beautiful Bill"" included a much-needed surge of $158 billion in defense spending, much of which is going to the Navy and shipbuilding and repair capacity expansion. Bravo.

The $300 billion intariff revenueexpected this year will more than cover the increase in defense spending. Bravo again.
""Free trade"" depends on freedom of navigation of the world’s oceans and ultimately on America’s military. Perhaps the skeptics of the president’s tariff program should begin to at least consider that the era of ""free riders"" on the backs of the United States Navy (and broader military) is over and after 80 years of subsidizing the international trading order via our defense budget, it’s time for trading nations to pay a share of that cost.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-rand-paul-favors-prospect-abolishing-federal-reserve,Sen. Rand Paul favors the prospect of abolishing the Federal Reserve,"Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., spoke to Fox News Digital about the Federal Reserve, noting that he would support abolishing it if the nation stops deficit spending.
Sen.Rand Paul, R-Ky., explained to Fox News Digital during an interview on Tuesday that he would support abolishing the Federal Reserve System, with the key proviso that the country stop engaging in deficit spending, and instead, run a balanced budget.
But the fiscal hawk and son of former U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, a famousFederal Reservecritic, says he does not anticipate that will happen.
""I see the opposite,"" he said, indicating that many in the GOP who previously cared ""about deficits under Biden, seem to care less about deficits under Trump.""

""I frankly think if Congress weren't running deficits you could do without a Fed,"" he said.
Though he added that there would need to be a ""clearinghouse"" system, indicating that with the Fed out of the picture, the market would need to be allowed to ""fill that space"" over time.
Paul believes that the free market — supply and demand — should dictate interest rates.
""Interest rates are a universal price,"" he explained, opining that they are likely ""the most prolific price in all of the economy.""
TRUMP IS CONCERNED ABOUT HOW THE FED IS MANAGED MORE THAN ABOUT FIRING POWELL, SAYS DEPUTY CHIEF OF STAFF
The last time the Federal Open Market Committee decided to decrease the target range for the federal funds rate was back in December, and PresidentDonald Trumphas been stridently calling for the Fed to move on rate cuts.
But Paul compared rate-cut demands to insisting that meat is too expensive, and Trump should lower its price — the senator pointed out that most people would view such a call as ""nonsensical"" as it pertains to consumer goods, ""but for some reason even conservatives sort of lose their mind when it comes to interest rates,"" he said.
The senator noted that he thinks ""really what we want is a Federal Reserve that's less involved with manipulating interest rates.""

This campaign ensures Americans know who is really fighting for them.""
TheRepublican packageis stuffed full of Trump's 2024 campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit.
FIRST ON FOX: REPUBLICANS LAUNCH MAJOR AD BLITZ TO SELL ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’
It includes extending the president's signature2017 tax cuts,which were about to expire later this year, and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay, as well as a new $6,000 deduction through 2028 for taxpayers 65 and over.
Democrats are criticizing the tax cuts as favoring the wealthy and big businesses at the expense of working-class Americans.
""There is nothing in this bill that's going to help hard-working Americans. Let's be very clear. This is a giveaway to the richest people in our country,"" Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin argued in a Fox News Digital interview last week.
The measure also provides billions for border security and codifies the president's controversial immigration crackdown.
The massive tax cut and spending package is also projected by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to increase the national debt by $4 trillion over the next decade, but many Republicans dispute the projection.
DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’
And the new law also restructures Medicaid, the 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans. The CBO this week estimated that 10 million people could lose their health insurance over the next decade.
Thechanges to Medicaidand cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's tax cuts. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulations, including work requirements for many of those seeking Medicaid coverage.

Democrats, for months, haverepeatedly blasted Republicansover the social safety net changes. And they spotlighted a slew of national polls last month and this month, including a recent one from Fox News, that indicate the bill's popularity is in negative territory.

""There’s been an avalanche of polls showing that the more people hear about the Big, Ugly Bill, the more they hate it, which is why support for the bill is underwater by nearly a 2-to-1 margin.,"" Viet Shelton, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC)'s national press secretary, told  Fox News Digital.
Shelton argued the measure ""strips away health care from millions of Americans, raises insurance premiums and jacks up electricity bills, all to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest few. It will be the defining issue of the midterms, ultimately costing House Republicans the majority.""
But the Fox News survey also indicates that 68% support the provisions making the first-term Trump tax cuts permanent. What's more, seven in ten approve of removing taxes on income from tips and overtime pay.

The crime of post-60s liberalism is that it created permanent Black underclasses all over America, including on the South Side ofChicagowhere I live. The schools here are poor. Opportunities have been replaced by government handouts. Violence robs far too many families of their loved ones. Yet, there is much untapped potential in these underclasses.
I thought about them as I listened toMike Roweof ""Dirty Jobs"" detail the need for hundreds of thousands of tradesmen and women recently at the Pennsylvania Energy & Innovation Summit. He began by saying, ""We’ve been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code."" I, too, have been told to pursue that as a means of opportunity for my youth. But I always believed in the power of the trades.
Rowe pointed out how the advent of AI has decimated many coding jobs but has not come after ""the welders, the plumbers, the steamfitters, the pipefitters, the HVAC, or the electricians."" AI cannot do manual labor.
MIKE ROWE REVEALS WHICH AMERICAN JOBS WILL REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY THE COMING AI REVOLUTION
For the last 20 or so, our nation has emphasized thecollege degreeabove everything, including vocational training. In my opinion, this has been disastrous. In my community, there are still those who look down at the prospect of working with their hands. They believe the college degree is their ticket. Maybe it is, but my point here is that work done by our hands should not be looked down upon in our culture. It’s honest work.
Rowe said that he heardLarry Fink, Chairman and CEO of BlackRock, say in Aspen that ""we need 500,000 electricians in the next couple of years — not hyperbole."" My non-profit has provided training in the electrician field to many individuals, including a Chicago Police officer who eventually left the force to work full time in her new field.
He said the over 80,000 collision repair technicians would be needed.
Over 140,000 tradespeople are needed to help companies build and deliver nuclear-powered submarines to the Navy.
And for the energy field, 300,000 to 500,000 people will be needed.
AI can’t do any of this work. But I know people from the South Side and similar neighborhoods across America who can.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/liz-peek-trumps-major-trade-wins-could-rocket-fuel-us-economy,LIZ PEEK: Trump's major trade wins could be rocket fuel to US economy,"Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick unpacks the U.S. and E.U. trade agreement on 'Special Report.'
Hats off to PresidentDonald Trump, who is singlehandedly reordering global trade, in the face of enormous opposition. The president took office pledging to make trade fair again for Americans, and he is well on his way to achieving exactly that.
While the initial roll-out of histariff programin April was clumsy, the subsequent negotiation of trade deals has been masterful. Much remains to be fully fleshed out for agreements concluded in weeks as opposed to the more customary years, but the essential ingredients are straightforward. The president and his team are working to lower the barriers to U.S. exports erected by countries around the world and, where our trading partners refuse to make concessions, charging them for access to our markets.
Here’s why he can force their hands: The United States is the world’s biggest economy, at $29 trillion;Chinaand the EU come next, at roughly $19 trillion. The U.S. leads in sheer size and also in the magnitude of our consumer market, at about 70% of GDP, or $20 trillion. By comparison, the Chinese consumer accounts for only some 40% of that country’s GDP, or less than $8 trillion. About 52% of the EU economy comes from consumer spending, or less than $10 trillion.
TRUMP ANNOUNCES TRADE DEAL WITH EUROPEAN UNION
Every country on Earth wants to export to the U.S. Consequently, our country has clout, and the president is determined to use it. He is removing tariffs that other countries have imposed on American-made goods coming into their countries and also fighting non-tariff barriers, such as illegal government subsidies, currency manipulation and arcane regulations set up by Europe and Japan, for instance, to exclude U.S. agricultural products and other goods. Our farmers are the most productive in the world – they can out-compete anyone, which has inspired tough protectionist measures from some of our trading partners.
Historically, countries around the world have not dealt fairly with the U.S. Conservatives dislikeTrump’s tariff programbecause they say it interferes with free trade, but the global exchange of goods and services is not free. When Europe charges U.S. carmakers a 10% duty on Chevys sent to Germany, and we only charge 2.5% on Volkswagens coming here, something is off.
Over the weekend, President Trump negotiated the grandaddy of all trade deals with the EU, imposing 15% tariffs on Europe’s imports and securing commitments that the EU will import sizeable amounts of energy. Success was not assured; the president himself, on the cusp of his talks withEuropean Commission PresidentUrsula von der Leyen, put the chances of concluding a deal at about 50-50. For our relentlessly optimistic president, he was cautious in the extreme, for good reason.
BACK FROM SCOTLAND, TRUMP ENTERS CRUCIAL TRADE WEEK AND EYES FED'S DECISION ON RATE CUTS
Actually, for several good reasons. First, the EU is a fractious group of 27 sovereign nations who, despite acting as a block, have very different economies and interests. Second, EU countries are for the most part run by condescending liberal elites who view Donald Trump as uncouth and annoying, as he persistently disrespects the globalism that bind them together. Third, they bitterly resent the United States, which is running rings around them on everything that matters, like technology and energy.
Donald Trump shakes hands with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after agreeing on a trade deal between the two economies following their meeting, in Turnberry south west Scotland on July 27, 2025.
President Trump’s caution was also warranted because EU leaders like to score political points back home by standing up to him; it was quite possible that the bloc’s leadership would torch a compromise in order to look strong. As it is, the deal was widely panned by European officials and economists, with the ever-obstreperous French leading the way. French Prime Minister François Bayrou furiously denounced the pact, describing it as ""submission.""
French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said he did not want Paris ""to settle with what happened yesterday because that would be accepting that Europe is not an economic power.""
Here’s a newsflash for French politicians nipping at von der Leyen’s ankles; Europe isn’t much of an economic power. The World Bank reports that from 2008 to 2023, EU GDP grew by 13.5% (from $16.37 trillion to $18.59 trillion) while U.S. GDP rose by 87% (from $14.77 to $27.72 trillion). In addition, EU GDP per capita as a percentage of U.S. GDP per capita fell from 76.5% in 2008 to 50% in 2023. That’s downright embarrassing.

Why is the EU such a laggard? First, because they have imposed stifling red tape on their domestic companies. Even the International Monetary Fund has chastised France, for instance, for their rigid work rules, which makes the hiring and firing of workers expensive.
Second, because the EU has prostrated itself on the altar of climate change. Its dedication to renewables has led to high power costs, with German companies, for example, paying nearly three times what the U.S. does for industrial electricity. With new technologies like AI requiring vast amounts of energy, the EU is uncompetitive.
Third, the EU is hampered by its cumbersome architecture; getting more than two dozen nations to sign off on major policies is difficult, which has meant the continent has fallen behind on technological innovation. That means low productivity and GDP growth.

EU officials are certainly not unique in expressing frustration over President Trump’s tariff battle. The conventional wisdom from economists and business leaders has been thattariffs will choke off tradeand make the world poorer. Roger Altman, the successful founder of investment bank Evercore, appeared on CNBC on Monday saying, ""Eventually, the tariffs will be passed on, dollar for dollar, to the consumer, and that will mean less consumption, less growth, less jobs and less profit.""

Maybe, but it’s also possible that companies will bring more production to the United States, to avoid tariffs, and that the revenuespouring into the Treasury, over $100 billion to date, will boost our fiscal outlook. Coupled with lower tax rates and lighter regulation, the trade battle is already attracting increased investment.
Trump has proved the conventional wisdom wrong more often than not; I wouldn’t bet against his tariff program.

The Trump administration has said it does not anticipate extending or delaying any deals beyond the Aug. 1 deadline.

Federal Reserve ChairmanJerome Powellwill announce a decision on the nation's federal funds target rate this week following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).
The 12-member FOMC will meet on July 29 to discuss monetary policy, with a key focus on whether to try to raise or lower the nation’s interest rates.
Trump, who named Powell as Fed chair in 2017, has stepped up his pressure campaign in recent weeks, urging the central bank to lower interest rates to 1% to stimulate economic growth.
A LOOK AT THE UNFOLDING BATTLE BETWEEN TRUMP AND POWELL OVER FED POLICY
Powell has held off cutting rates, in part, to assess theeconomic impactof Trump's ongoing trade deals. Powell's wait-and-see economic approach has kept the central bank’s key borrowing rate within a range of 4.25% to 4.5%.
Trump has previously placed the blame squarely on Powell for not cutting rates, a move he says has cost the U.S. ""hundreds of billions of dollars.""
Before leaving for Scotland, the president called on Powell to cut the nation's interest rates, citing a strong job market and cooling inflation.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/how-trumps-no-shrinking-violets-doj-digging-schiffs-mortgage-dealings-legal-peril-looms,How Trump's 'no shrinking violets' DOJ is digging in on Schiff's mortgage dealings as legal peril looms,"Cornell Law School Professor William Jacobson spoke to Fox News Digital to provide his legal insight on the investigation into California Sen. Adam Schiff’s mortgages stretching back to the early 2000s.
TheDepartment of Justiceis likely digging into Sen. Adam Schiff's mortgage paperwork trail stretching back to a Maryland home purchase from the early 2000s as it weighs whether it has an airtight case to potentially prosecute the longtime political foe of President Donald Trump, according to a Cornell Law School professor.
""The one thing they don't want to do is to bring a case that fails,"" William Jacobson told Fox Digital in a Zoom interview, referring to the DOJ potentially investigating Schiff's alleged mortgage fraud. Jacobson is a clinical professor and the Director of the Securities Law Clinic at Cornell.
""Either it fails legally, or it fails in court. They don't want to lose that case if you're going against a major political opponent. And that's part of the calculation that will take place.""
Jacobson talked about the ins and outs of the Democratic California senator's potential legal woes following the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency sending a letter to the DOJ this year claiming that Schiff falsified banking and property documents by listing two homes – on two separate coasts – as his primary residence out of an effort to allegedly get more favorable loans.
The DOJ has not yet said whether it would take up the case, but is likely digging into Schiff's paper trail as it weighs whether to move forward, Jacobson explained.

""I would expect that the first thing the Department of Justice is going to do is to gather documents. There will be a paper trail here. There will be many things that are documentable, and not ‘he said, she said,’ as to where Adam Schiff was actually living,"" he said.
As investigators go through the documents, they will ask questions such as: What was his actual primary residence? What did he sign? Who was present when he signed? Did he have conversations with people about it?
The law professor, who founded the popular conservative legal blog Legal Insurrection, said that there will likely be a ""significant paper trail"" to go through due to the case stretching back more than 20 years and due to companies keeping tight records following the 2008 financial crash.
""Mortgage companies preserve all of these things because of the financial crisis and other things. They have to maintain these records. . . . And I would expect that that would be the first thing the Department of Justice would look at is the paper trail and the circumstantial evidence as to where Adam Schiff was, in fact, living,"" he continued, remarking that there are ""no shrinking violets"" at the Trump DOJ.

Schiff first fell under scrutiny this year in May, when the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sent a letter to the Department of Justice sounding the alarm that, in ""multiple instances,""Schiff allegedly""falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property.""
At the heart of the issue are two properties purchased by Schiff: a home purchased in 2003 in Potomac, Maryland, for $870,000 under a Fannie Mae-backed mortgage agreement for $610,000 at a rate of 5.625% over a term of 30 years, and a 2009 Burbank, Calif., condo. Schiff reaffirmed the Potomac property as his principal residence in mortgage refinancing paperwork in 2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013, according to the FHFA letter to the DOJ.
Over the same time frame, Schiff took a homeowner’s tax exemption on the Burbank condo while also claiming that home as his primary residence for a $7,000 reduction off of the 1% property tax, FHFA Director William Pulte wrote in the letter to the DOJ, citing media reports.
In 2023, the letter continued, a spokesperson for Schiff asserted that ""Adam’s primary residence is Burbank, California, and will remain so when he wins the Senate seat.""
FHFA is an independent federal agency that oversees Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System.

In 2020, Schiff refinanced his mortgage, listing his Maryland home as his secondary residence.
Trump publiclyslammed Schiff over his mortgages in July on Truth Social, accusing him of fraud and putting the issue back on the public's radar following 2023 news reports on Schiff's homes in Maryland and California.
""I have always suspected Shifty Adam Schiff was a scam artist,"" Trump posted to Truth Social Tuesday. ""And now I learn that Fannie Mae’s Financial Crimes Division have concluded that Adam Schiff has engaged in a sustained pattern of possible Mortgage Fraud.""

""Adam Schiff said that his primary residence was in MARYLAND to get a cheaper mortgage and rip off America, when he must LIVE in CALIFORNIA because he was a Congressman fromCALIFORNIA. I always knew Adam Schiff was a Crook. The FRAUD began with the refinance of his Maryland property on February 6, 2009, and continued through multiple transactions until the Maryland property was correctly designated as a second home on October 13, 2020.""
FOX NEWS POLITICS NEWSLETTER: SCHIFF FLAGGED FOR POTENTIAL MORTGAGE FRAUD BY TRUMP OFFICIAL
Schiff has repeatedly denied and brushed off the accusations, including refusing to answer questions from Fox News Digital about his alleged mortgage fraud when confronted in the nation's capital on July 16.
""Since I led his first impeachment, Trump has repeatedly called for me to be arrested for treason. So in a way, I guess this is a bit of a letdown. And this baseless attempt at political retribution won’t stop me from holding him accountable. Not by a long shot,"" he posted to X in July following Trump's initial Truth Social attack on Schiff's mortgages.
""This is just Donald Trump’s latest attempt at political retaliation against his perceived enemies. So it is not a surprise, only how weak this false allegation turns out to be. And much as Trump may hope, this smear will not distract from his Epstein files problem,"" he added.
Schiff's primary residence discrepancies first hit the public's radar in 2023, when Schiff launched an ultimately successful campaign to serve in the Senate after decades in the U.S. House. CNN published the first news article detailing that Schiff had claimed the Maryland home as a primary residence while also taking a homeowner’s tax exemption on the Burbank condo.
The campaign said at the time that Schiff's two properties were listed as primary residences ""for loan purposes because they are both occupied throughout the year and to distinguish them from a vacation property.""
Trump and Schiff have long been political foes, which was underscored during Trump's first administration when Schiff served as the lead House manager during the first impeachment trial against Trump in 2020, and when Schiff repeatedly promoted claims that Trump's 2016 campaigncolluded with Russia.
WATCH: ADAM SCHIFF SILENT AFTER TRUMP ACCUSED HIM OF MORTGAGE FRAUD
Days after Trump first posted about Schiff's mortgages in Maryland and California, the president's Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, declassified documents that reportedly show ""overwhelming evidence"" that then-President Barack Obama and his national security team laid the groundwork for what would be the yearslong Trump–Russia collusion probeafter Trump's election win against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Schiff was an incredibly vocal lawmaker amid the Russian collusion claims, most notably when the House censured him in 2023 over his promotion that Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. Schiff served in the House representing California from 2001 to 2024, when he was sworn-in as a senator after his successful 2024 campaign to serve in the nation's upper chamber.

Schiff served as the ranking member of the House intelligence committee from 2015 to 2019, before becoming the committee's chair from 2019 to 2023. In that role, he was kept up to date on classified materials surrounding the Russian collusion claims.
Trump also recently invoked Gabbard's alleged revelations while attacking Schiff over his mortgages in another Truth Social post.
FEDERAL HOUSING OFFICIAL SUBMITTED SCHIFF CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO DOJ OVER MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS
Trump went on to ominously warn during a White House event last week that Schiff has ""a lot of other things far worse than"" his mortgage inquiry.
""He defrauded banks and insurance companies and the federal government, but it's, very simple. It's mortgage loan fraud ... But he has a lot of other things far worse than that. So no Adam Schiff, they have him 100% on mortgage fraud,"" Trump said last Tuesday from the White House while hosting a meeting with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.
Jacobson said that Democrats have boxed themselves out of attempting to claim that Trump is targeting a political foe over the mortgage criminal referral because the party had spent the last decade launching ""lawfare"" at Trump.
""One of the ironies here that I think everybody understands, is that Democrats launched a lawfare campaign against Donald Trump. And it didn't just start once he took office this year. It's been going on for a decade,"" he said.
""They have used every tool available to try to destroy him, including through criminal prosecutions, including through federal investigations. . . .  They've really tried to get him. And for them now to say, 'oh, just because we did that to you for 10 years doesn't give you the right to do it to us.' Legally, that's sound. I mean, you have to prove your case in court. But politically, I don't think that's going to fly. Democrats screaming that Donald Trump is weaponizing prosecutors against them is not going to really impress a lot of people.""

Jacobson speculated that there will likely be more woes for Schiff in the coming days, but that potential legal cases hinge on prosecutors.
""We don't know where this is going ahead, of course, but it does appear that Adam Schiff is in the sights of Donald Trump. No surprise about that, because Donald Trump has been in the sights of Adam Schiff for a decade. So, I fully expect that there will be more here. The question is going to be really though, once it moves into the realm of prosecution, what are the prosecutors going to do?""
The Department of Justice declined comment when approached about potentially investigating and taking up the Schiff case. Schiff's office did not respond to Fox Digital's request for comment.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/could-senator-adam-schiff-really-go-jail-over-alleged-mortgage-fraud,Could Senator Adam Schiff really go to jail over alleged mortgage fraud?,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump accusing Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., of mortgage fraud.
FederalHousingFinance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte sent a criminal referral to Attorney General Pam Bondi in May alleging thatCalifornia Democrat Sen. Adam Schiff""has, in multiple instances, falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property.""
What is the gist of the complaint?That Schiff,while representing a California district in the House of Representatives, falsely listed his posh Maryland home as his primary residence in order to get more favorable loan terms when, in truth and in fact, his California condo, which he designated as his primary residence in order to qualify for a California homeowner’s tax exemption, was his real primary residence.
Even worse, according to the referral, Schiff claimed his Burbank condo as his primary/principal residence in California tax filings during the same years he listed his Maryland home as his primary/principal residence on loan applications to finance that home.

Schiff’s response to the criminal referral and to subsequent Truth Social posts by PresidentDonald Trumpwas one we often see in white collar cases.Per the senator’s office,""the lenders who provided the mortgages for both homes were well aware of then-Representative Schiff’s Congressional service and of his intended year-round use of both homes, neither of which were vacation homes.""

That’s not much of a denial, senator. The question is whether you lied on these forms or not. Were your answers accurate or not, and if they were inaccurate, were the answers a mistake or intentional?
The devil is always in the details in white-collar cases like this. Which representatives of which particular lenders ""were well aware"" that Schiff intended to use both homes year-round, and why does that matter?
FEDERAL HOUSING OFFICIAL SUBMITTED SCHIFF CRIMINAL REFERRAL TO DOJ OVER MORTGAGE DOCUMENTS
The issue is whether Schiff intentionally lied on federal or state forms to gain a financial advantage. If he falsely listed his Maryland home as his primary residence in order to get a lower interest rate, that matters too. (After all, similar alleged falsehoods by Donald Trump were used by New YorkAttorney General Letitia Jamesto go after Trump in her massive New York state civil action.)
Did Schiff lie on California tax forms to gain an exemption he was not entitled to, and, if so, does it implicate any federal criminal statutes? This is what inquiring minds want to know, and we just don’t have enough information at this stage to know all the answers.
Based on what we do know, how likely is it that Schiff will be indicted for violating one of severalfederal bank fraud statutesthat potentially cover his conduct? Not very likely.  Here are several reasons why:

This leaves open the possibility of a state of California prosecution for filing false tax returns. Would you care to place any bets on that happening? The bottom line is this: Schiff’s alleged conduct may be sleazy and his explanation shifty, but a criminal charge at the federal or state level does not seem to be in the offing.

New York Democratic Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortezhas found herself in the red, owing thousands of dollars to a Black-owned, female-led accessories brand after breaching the House ""Gift Rule.""
The violation stems from not paying the full market value for items she donned at the2021 MET Gala, where she famously wore the ""Tax the Rich"" dress, and accepting free admission to the event for her fiancé, Riley Roberts.
Tickets to the Met Gala cost at least $30,000, the Associated Press reported. It is unclear whether Ocasio-Cortez purchased her own ticket.
The House Ethics Committee released its report on Friday, finding that although Ocasio-Cortez ""proactively took steps"" to comply with the Gift Rule in relation to her Met Gala appearance, shefailed to fully comply.

The committee found evidence suggesting that the designer, Brother Vellies, may have lowered costs in response to statements from Ocasio-Cortez’s staff, and that payments to vendors were significantly delayed, according to the report.
In several cases, payment did not occur until after the investigation was initiated, the committee noted.
The report also concluded that members of AOC’s staff were ""overly reliant"" on the vendors themselves to ensure her compliance with the Gift Rule, despite the vendors’ countervailing incentives to ensure she would be able to promote their goods and services.

However, the committee said it did not conclude that the alleged underpayments had been ""intentional,"" instead placing the blame on a campaign staffer who handled payment discussions.
AOC herself blamed her staff while speaking with investigators in March 2023, saying she did not know of any unpaid expenses related to the dress she had worn and stylists who prepared her for the gala, Fox News Digitalpreviously reported.
""I just never, ever, ever would have allowed that to happen, knowing what I have learned,"" Ocasio-Cortez said at the time. ""But I wasn't privy to the invoices, wasn't privy to the ones that had been sent.""

DreamDrive Pro combines advanced hardware and intelligent software to power Lucid's driver-assistance system. It uses 32 integrated sensors, including LiDAR, radar, visible-light and surround-view cameras and ultrasonic sensors. This setup delivers precise environmental awareness for everything from highway cruising to close-range maneuvers.
Because the platform is software-defined, Lucid can roll out new features like hands-free highway driving and automated lane changes through over-the-air updates. Drivers receive continuous improvements without needing hardware upgrades or service appointments.

These updates are just the beginning. Lucid is investing heavily in advanced driver-assistance and automation, with a clear focus on safety, comfort and long-term innovation.
Lucid now joins the ranks of top hands-free driving systems. Tesla's Full Self-Driving andGM's Super Cruiseboth offer hands-free driving on highways, though they differ in how they monitor driver attention and what roads they support. Ford's BlueCruise is another major option, available on a growing number of mapped highways. Mercedes-Benz Drive Pilot goes a step further by letting drivers take their eyes off the road in certain traffic conditions, though it's only available in limited markets for now.

If you're driving a car with advanced driver-assistance features, such as theLucid Air or similar models, you're likely noticing real changes in your daily routine. With hands-off driving now available on select highways, those stressful commutes can feel a little easier. Sitting in stop-and-go traffic doesn't have to be such a chore anymore. Long road trips? Suddenly, they're much more comfortable. Many automakers, not just Lucid, are pushing out updates directly to your car, so you can access new tools without ever stepping into a service center.
Safety is at the forefront with these new systems. As you drive, a network of sensors and smart software helps keep your lane changes smooth, your following distances steady and your ride free from abrupt surprises. These advances can give you peace of mind, but it's essential to remember that these systems don't drive for you. You still need to stay alert and keep your hands ready.
With more cars using similar technology each year, the roads themselves are changing. There's hope that fewer accidents caused by distraction or delayed reactions will benefit not just tech-savvy drivers, but everyone out there. While these models, like the Lucid Air, showcase what's possible, the real transformation comes as driver-assistance features become the new normal in cars everywhere.

Lucid's new hands-free driving update puts it in direct competition with Tesla, GM, and other automakers working to change the way we drive. With DreamDrive Pro, Lucid shows that combining advanced hardware, in-house software, and frequent updates can deliver real capability. As more companies roll out similar systems, drivers are getting more options, and the convenience once reserved for luxury models is becoming more accessible.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/we-cant-abolish-americas-largest-teachers-union-congress-can-do-something-else,We can’t abolish America's largest teachers union. But Congress can do something else,"Mom's for Liberty co-founder Tina Descovich joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why Republican lawmakers are taking action against the National Education Association over 'radical' ideals.
For decades, theNational Education Association(NEA) – the country’s largest teachers union – has amassed nearly unrivaled political power with which to pursue its own narrow self-interest and impose its radical social and economic agenda.
COVID-19 placed the NEA under the microscope as never before, offering the union an opportunity for some much-needed introspection. In 2021, the Wall Street Journaleditorial board proclaimed what informed conservatives have long known and what, by that time, had become obvious to the public at large:
The NEA is ""the ideological and institutional vanguard of progressive politics,"" a ""powerful wing of theDemocratic Party,"" and intent on ""invading"" public schools with ""progressive politics.""
National Education Association President Becky Pringle at a rally outside the U.S. Capitol ahead of Linda McMahon's confirmation hearing to become secretary of education, Feb. 12, 2025, in Washington, D.C.(Paul Morigi/Getty Images for National Education Association)
But instead of abandoning its partisan special interests and returning to its early mission of ""[promoting] the cause of education in the United States,"" the NEA emerged from the pandemic determined to double down on every one of its harmful, misguided beliefs and ideologies.
TEACHERS UNION REVEALS TRUE COLORS BEHIND CLOSED DOORS AT ANNUAL CONVENTION
The NEA’s annual Representative Assembly, held this month in Portland, generated headlines and mockery as copies of the controversial resolutions approved by the union’s delegates were leaked to the public, including everything from attacking democratically elected PresidentDonald Trumpas a ""fascist"" to undermining the enforcement of our immigration laws and, in a brazen display of the union’s antisemitism, cutting ties with the pro-Jewish Anti-Defamation League.
While the growing public outcry over their extremism led the NEA to stop making its convention resolutions publicly available, the dizzying array of woke material freely available on the union’s website is even more shocking.
For instance, some of the ""important"" documents posted online for attendees at the NEA’s Portland convention included: a ""Pronoun Guide"" claiming that people who do not habitually share their pronouns are ""unsafe""; a byzantine ""Land Acknowledgement Guide"" directing readers to fight ""colonization"" by reminding attendees at any event of the ""dispossession of Indigenous land and people""; and a form to submit complaints to the NEA’s ""Committee on Equity & Ethnic Harmony"" should any conference attendee breach social justice protocols.
PARENTS MUST STAY ALERT AS PUBLIC SCHOOLS HIDE LIFE-ALTERING DECISIONS FROM FAMILIES
More concerning was the NEA’s nine-page ""report"" for convention delegates highlighting the union’s priorities and activities in the first half of the year. Among other things, theunion boastedabout: ""taking the lead in filing lawsuits"" against the Trump administration; fighting efforts to defund DEI in public schools; shuttering schools with strikes; fighting ""authoritarianism"" and engaging in ""resistance"" by supporting the ""No Kings"" rally and similar protests; backing ""World Pride and LGBTQ+ Pride Month""; organizing ""labor opposition"" to immigration enforcement; and working to ""flip"" the U.S. House of Representatives to Democrats in 2026.
Notably absent from the union’s achievements? Improving student learning, promoting family values or using tax dollars efficiently.
If this is what happens when NEA completely controls an event and its programming, the union’s tremendous influence over classrooms is a five-alarm fire not just forpublic education, but the future of our country.
Congressional action addressing the pernicious influence of the teachers unions is long overdue. That’s why I (Mr. Fitzgerald) and Sen. Cynthia Lummis from Wyoming have introduced the Stopping Teachers Unions from Damaging Education Needs Today (STUDENT) Act, which would overhaul the NEA’s federal charter to make the union more accountable and less partisan.
MY VISION FOR ELIMINATING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
The NEA received a federal charter by act of Congress in 1906, granting it special recognition shared by only 95 organizations, including such storied American institutions as the Boy Scouts, the U.S. Olympic Committee and the VFW – company which the NEA no longer deserves to keep.
Congressional Republicans have long proposed addressing the NEA’s ideological extremism by repealing its federal charter. But as the Freedom Foundation explained in a 2023 report, the NEA incorporated under the laws of the District of Columbia long before receiving its federal charter, meaning it would continue to exist and operate as it does now even if stripped of its special federal recognition.
The STUDENT Act takes a different approach, rewriting the union’s charter rather than repealing it.
According to the Freedom Foundation’s analysis, the NEA’s charter lacks many of the safeguards and accountability mechanisms common in other federal charters intended to ensure the chartered organizations remain uncontroversial, patriotic and deserving of federal recognition.

Under the STUDENT Act, the NEA would have to abide by the same rules as other federally chartered entities, such as refraining from partisan political advocacy and abiding by corporate transparency requirements.
The legislation also addresses some of the worst NEA practices unique to its status as a labor union, requiring it torespect teachers’ First Amendment right to refrain from union membership, prohibiting it from closing schools with damaging strikes, barring the union from advocating for the core concepts of critical race theory, and more.
Perhaps most importantly, the STUDENT Act would end direct and indirect taxpayer subsidies for the NEA and its affiliates around the country.

Conservatives recognize that the time for action is now, with more than 30 organizations around the country endorsing the STUDENT Act.
Republicans in Congressscored a huge win for education freedom with the recent passage of school choice tax credits in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
But the next step in making public education great again should be taking on the NEA.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom is suing the Trump administration for pulling back $4 billion in federal funding for high-speed rail. But PresidentDonald Trumphasn’t actually derailed any trains. And all the lawsuit has really done is expose the trainwreck that is California’s fiscal situation.
For months,Newsom has braggedabout California having the world’s fourth-largest economy and sending back more money to Washington than it takes in. He’s right, but he’s also conveniently ignoring that California also boasts the nation’s highest real poverty rate and a projected budget deficit as high as $20 billion.

Let’s start with thehigh-speed rail project. Voters approved it in 2008 to run from San Francisco to Los Angeles at an approximate cost of $40 billion with a completion date of 2033. As of June of this year, the projected cost was as high as $128 billion with no track laid.
CALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000
Los Angeles residents know this kind of bureaucratic ineptitude all too well. Complex and sometimes conflicting county and state environmental regulations played an important role in the closure of the county’s second-largest landfill, Chiquita Canyon, at the end of 2024.
Residents now have to fund the added expense of hauling trash to a landfill farther away while local politicians obsess over ""price-gouging"" by those who haul and handle residents’ garbage. Taxpayers are burdened enough with the political junk Sacramento sends their way; local officials would be a lot more useful if they reduced, instead of added, to the heap.
Los Angeles, meanwhile, can’t seem to provide essential services at any price, gouged or otherwise. Check out all of the fire hydrants that didn’t workduring the recent firesand the empty city-run reservoir nearby. Anyone who oversaw those failures and still has a job is gouging taxpayers with every paycheck.
Paying for incompetence is bad enough, but what aboutcorruption? That’s what taxpayers across the state have funded for years as officials in state, county and city governments have colluded in a Medicaid reimbursement scheme by allowing government-owned providers to charge as much as 13 times more for certain services than the private sector is allowed to charge.

Not only has this practice squeezed private providers, thereby limiting care options for non-Medicaid patients, but it has allowed California to paper over its unfunded pension obligations for government employees by pocketing the difference.
And those obligations will come due faster than policymakers prefer as the nation’s highest cost-of-living andtop marginal tax ratescontinue to drive taxpayers and businesses out of the state.
""Businesses that want to grow and parents who want to provide for their families have been moving out of California for a decade, especially to states like Texas and Florida that have no or minimal income taxes,"" said Vance Ginn, Ph.D., chief economist for the Office of Management and Budget during the first Trump administration. ""And that trend isn’t likely to reverse itself because lawmakers and regulators up and down the state keep spending more and regulating and taxing themselves out of residents.""

Cleaning up California’s fiscal mess will take a lot more than creative accounting tricks, piecemealing federal funding grants and soaking the taxpayers – like the one-time windfall of capital gains taxes that created the temporary surplus in 2022. It requires reining in out-of-control spending while also reducing the regulatory burden on residents and businesses.
That’s whyNewsom’s lawsuitover the train funds isn’t about infrastructure. It’s about image. His flip on gender identity issues and sudden support for reducing California’s atrocious housing regulations were sops to ""the middle,"" but he also wants to make the Left happy by showing he can stand up to Trump. At federal taxpayer expense, of course, all the while claiming that he’s keeping California ""innovative"" while basic governance collapses underneath.

PresidentDonald Trumpsaid he wants Elon Musk to ""thrive"" just weeks after he suggested the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could investigate him.
In apost on Truth Social,the president said, ""Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon’s companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government. This is not so!
""I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before! The better they do, the better the USA does, and that’s good for all of us. We are setting records every day, and I want to keep it that way!"" Trump added.
At the start of July, Trump – who was entangled in a public feud with the SpaceX and Tesla CEO this summer – told reporters that DOGE may have toinvestigate Musk.

""DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon. Wouldn't that be terrible?"" Trump said at the time. ""He gets a lot of subsidies. But, Elon was very upset that the EV mandate is going to be terminated.""
Trump previously told the media in June that his relationship with Musk changed when the president began discussing plans to eliminate the electric vehicle mandate, which would affect Musk's signature electric company, Tesla.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/good-economic-data-bad-news-trumps-interest-rate-push,Good economic data is bad news for Trump’s interest rate push,"'Shark Tank' star Kevin O’Leary discusses President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy, the markets’ response and Democrats' fearmongering on ‘America Reports.’
Recenteconomic datahas been very solid. Consumers have shown continued resiliency, boosting retail sales up 0.6% for the month of June. The labor market remains solid.
And while the stock market isn’t the economy per se, key market indices, including the broader-based S&P 500, continue to hit all-time highs.
Normally, this would be very good news for a president’s economic agenda. But given America’s current fiscal situation, it is hindering one of PresidentDonald Trump’s main focal points – the hope that the Fed will substantially lower its target interest rates.

The American fiscal situation is a precarious one, which has brought about several debt downgrades from the rating agencies, the last being in May, while U.S. debt is supposed to be the ""safe haven"" investment for the global financial system.
LEFT'S TARIFF DOOMSDAY PREDICTIONS FALL FLAT AS TRUMP'S AMERICA THRIVES
The U.S. debt/GDP ratio is about double what most entities believe is a manageable and sustainable ceiling. Our deficit as a percentage of GDP is at wartime or deep recession levels, without the U.S. being at war or in a recession.
And with such a heavy and growing debt load, now at $37 trillion, the interest cost on that debt is around $1 trillion, which is more than we spend on defense. Having debt financing costs exceed defense spending is not a signal of a healthy country.
President Trump and his administration are rightfully focused on the excessive current interest cost on our debt. And, with more than $9 trillion in debt that has or needs to be refinanced this year, plus another couple trillion from new deficit spending, the cost of debt financing matters.
The higher the interest rates on Treasury debt, the higher the cost of financing and refinancing. That leads to higher deficits, and all else being equal, even higher interest rates as more debt needs to be financed. Wash, rinse and repeat and debt costs and deficits will keep going higher.
So, it is understandable that the president wants lower interest rates – even back to 1% or lower as he has recently mentioned. However, there are several challenges with that.
INVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES
Back to where we started, strong economic data and all-time highs in the market do not signal that interest rates are holding back economic activity. This makes it harder for Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to justify rate cuts given their own mandate, although not impossible as their actions are often headscratchers.
It’s also somewhat of a moot point, because the Fed’s target rates directly impact what’s called the short-end of the yield curve (aka short-dated securities like 1-month T-Bills, as an example). For the U.S. to term out its debt (refinance short-dated securities for a longer amount of time, like 10 years), the relevant yield is that of the longer-dated securities.
While sometimes the Fed’s rate has an indirect impact on those longer-dated securities, in recent times, it has not. In fact, we saw after the Fed rate cuts in the fall of 2024 that yields on 10-year Treasurys increased instead of decreased.
There’s no guarantee that further cuts would have the desired effects, and could have other consequences, likere-stoking inflation.
For longer dated securities, the market sets the pricing, and supply and demand is front and center.
YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE THE SOLUTION TO THE DEBT CRISIS, BUT HERE'S HOW TO FIX AMERICA'S SPENDING PROBLEM
It used to be that global central banks consistently increased their buying of U.S. Treasurys, but over the past decade or so, they have actually been net sellers, as countries around the world have been hurt by the mismanagement of theU.S. dollaras the world’s reserve currency and are looking for ways to decrease their dependence upon it.
So, today’s Treasury buyers are those focused on price, and with recent debt downgrades and concerns about the U.S.’s fiscal foundation, they are demanding more of a premium to hold U.S. debt for longer periods of time.
With the U.S. continuing to run large deficits, adding more supply to this price-sensitive demand, all else equal, only drives up the yields and U.S. debt financing costs.
So, fiscal policy – which is managed by Congress, not theFed’s monetary policy– is what’s most critical today.
The Trump administration is currently looking at other ways to bring the interest rates down, impacting the demand side for Treasury.

The recently signed GENIUS Act may provide one avenue. TreasurySecretary Scott Bessenthas said, ""Recent reporting projects that stablecoins could grow into a $3.7 trillion market by the end of the decade. That scenario becomes more likely with passage of the GENIUS Act. A thriving stablecoin ecosystem will drive demand from the private sector for U.S. Treasuries, which back stablecoins.""
This, if it comes to fruition, may help lower rates, although again, it may only increase demand for shorter duration Treasury securities.
There are a slew of other tools and opportunities that are likely forthcoming that can create other avenues of demand for Treasurys and help lower yields.

The tools available to the administration may be effective and lower rates, maybe even to the extremely low levels desired by the president. But it will only be a temporary solution if our deficits and debt problems aren’t addressed. Furthermore, it may come with the cost of more inflation, as accommodative policies don’t happen in a vacuum and have economic consequences.
Powell and the Fed may not be willing to give on interest rates – at least at the levels the president is seeking – ifeconomic dataremains strong. President Trump will have other options, but they are only bandages. We will not a have a permanent solution until a concerted effort is made to fix our debt and deficits.

It’s ""no secret"" where the International Brotherhood of Teamsters’ leadership stands on tariff implementation, union leaderSean O’Brientestified before Congress.
On Tuesday, Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, told O’Brien he believes he is sincere when he speaks about public policy that grows a ""thriving middle class in this country.""
""That’s not an act,"" Moreno suggested, to which O’Brien confirmed.
""I think someone referred to me as a self-promotingunion bossin one of their articles, but I'm not a self-promoting union boss. I'm a truck driver from a middle-class family that appreciates and embraces the preservation of the middle class,"" O’Brien said before the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Surface Transportation.
""There’s no secret what our position is as a union on tariffs.""

O’Brien took heat from the left for agreeing to speak at the 2024 Republican National Convention, and has been more open than some union leaders to engage with the Trump administration.
In the hearing, he acknowledged public concern over the timing and specifics regarding the implementation of Trump’s tariff regime and its effect on the U.S. consumer.
However, he lambasted the 1993 NAFTA agreement forged under the Clinton administration, blaming the now-former framework for shipping jobs overseas.
""Remember when we had plenty of industry in this country where we were producing goods and services. We were manufacturing steel. We were doing a lot of this work. And then these bad trade deals happened…""
DEMOCRATS LASH OUT AT ‘MISINFORMED’ AS TEAMSTERS UNION MAKES LANDMARK NON-ENDORSEMENT
O’Brien added that while there is concern over job loss as well, there are other cost factors at play with the new tariff regime.
He said corporate America should shoulder some of any negative fallout from the tariffs.
""Take a little less in your own pocket, stop giving more to Wall Street, and just reward your workers and don't pass this cost on the consumers,"" he said.
""We’ve got to take a look at excessive compensation with a lot of these CEOs and these corporations and their willingness to reward Wall Street instead of the people that work in these jobs.""
The Teamsters, which represent UPS workers as one of their largest workforces, also have been concerned over foreign nationals, who may not know English or U.S. traffic laws, being allowed to swoop in and take commercial driver's license (CDL) jobs, O’Brien said.
Trump in Aprilformally decreed strict English proficiency standardsfor CDL drivers, which Moreno also asked O'Brien about.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Moreno noted that as an immigrant himself – from Colombia – his parents required him to learn English, and asked O’Brien his thoughts on the flood of English-illiterate drivers on the same roads his members carry parcels every day.
""I think it's extremely frightening, to be honest with you. You had a lot of trucking companies that were actively recruiting in foreign countries to bring people over here on those work visas… and train them and put them on the roads – where they're not from this country, they don't know this language,"" he said.
""So our members are very passionate. By the way, our membership of 1.3 million is well representative from first-generation immigrants who came over here the right way, who learned the language, learned the laws, obtain this CDLs properly. And went to work and everything else.""
He suggested another solution being that Mexican truck drivers could drop their trailers at the U.S. border, to be picked up by American drivers who finish the trip.

FIRST ON FOX: A top political group that's allied withSenate Republicansis launching a major ad blitz showcasing what it calls the ""Working Family Tax Cuts"" in the newly passed GOP domestic policy package.
The spots by One Nation, a public policy organization aligned with Majority Leader John Thune, applaud Senate Republicans for ""deliveringPresident Trump'sagenda"" by passing the sweeping and controversial measure named by Trump as the ""one, big, beautiful bill.""
The ads, which One Nation said will run for several weeks on broadcast, cable and digital, are part of an eight-figure issue campaign. The spots were shared first with Fox News Digital on Wednesday.
""America is back, thanks to President Trump and Leader John Thune's Working Family tax cuts. Not tax on tips or overtime. Real relief for every American up early and home late,"" the narrator in the national ad touts.
RNC CHAIR SAYS ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’ KEY TO GOP'S MESSAGING EFFORT HEADED INTO MIDTERMS
Besides the national ad, the spots will run in Alaska, Florida, Ohio, South Carolina, Texas, and West Virginia, and will thank GOP Sens. Dan Sullivan, Ashley Moody, Jon Husted,Lindsey Graham, John Cornyn, and Shelley Moore Capito for helping to pass the megabill.
And the ads are part of a concerted messaging effort by the White House and Senate and House Republicans to showcase how the tax cuts in the measure will benefit working-class Americans.
POLITICAL FIGHT OVER ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’ IS FRONT-AND-CENTER IN KEY SENATE RACE
""One Nation will never cease to educate Americans about the Republican Party's historic effort to pass the Working Family Tax Cuts,"" said former GOP Sen. Cory Gardner of Colorado, who serves as One Nation chairman.

TheRepublican packageis stuffed full of Trump's 2024 campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit.
It includes extending the president's signature2017 tax cuts— which were set to expire later this year — and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay.

The measure also provides billions for border security and codifies the president's controversial immigration crackdown.
""Senate Republicans got President Trump's conservative agenda done, securing the border, finishing the wall, bringing manufacturing jobs back home,"" the narrator in the ad highlights.

The massive legislation is also projected to surge the national debt by $4 trillion over the next decade, but many Republicans dispute the projection by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).
And the new law also restructures Medicaid — the almost 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans. The CBO this week estimated that 10 million people could lose their health insurance over the next decade.
DEMOCRATS TAKE AIM AT TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’
Thechanges to Medicaid, as well as cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's tax cuts. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulations, including work requirements for many of those seeking Medicaid coverage.
""It protected Medicaid for Americans, not illegals,"" the narrator in the ad emphasizes.
But Democrats, for months, haverepeatedly blasted Republicansover the social safety net changes. And they spotlighted a slew of national polls last month and this month that indicate the bill's popularity in negative territory.
WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’
TheDemocratic National Committee(DNC) claims that the bill, which Trump signed into law on July 4 after the GOP-controlled House and Senate narrowly passed the measure along near-party-line votes, will gut Medicaid, forcing rural hospitals and nursing homes to close their doors.
""Rural hospitals were already on the brink of collapse thanks to Donald Trump, but now he has put the last nail in the coffin for rural hospitals with his billionaire budget bill,"" DNC chair Ken Martin argued in a statement to Fox News earlier this week.

Martin highlighted that ""in states across the country, hospitals are either closing their doors or cutting critical services, and it’s Trump’s own voters who will suffer the most. This is what Donald Trump does — screw over the people who are counting on him.""
Both parties see the ""big, beautiful bill"" as a key part of their messaging heading into next year's midterm elections, when the Republicans will be defending their slim majorities in the House and Senate.

EXCLUSIVE:AsNew York Citysocialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani pushes solutions to the city’s housing issues, including a rent freeze, Fox News Digital spoke to a local expert who said Mamdani’s agenda will do more harm than good to the housing situation.
""The fundamental problem with New York City's housing market is that there is not enough supply to meet the demand,"" John Ketcham, a legal policy fellow and director of cities at the Manhattan Institute, told Fox News Digital.
""The city government has prevented the private sector from building enough housing through zoning, through other forms of regulation, through affordability requirements and so forth, and so we've had more jobs created in New York City than housing units to support the population of newcomers and so that has simply increased prices. Prices are an effect of the supply-demand dynamic. They're not a cause, they're an effect.""
Mamdani, positioning himself as a champion of the working class and someone who would address the housing crisis withpolicies like a rent freeze, doesn’t address the actual problem.

""Assembly member Mamdani's proposal to freeze the rent would only apply to the 1 million units of rent-stabilized apartments,"" Ketcham said. ""Now, these are units that can only increase in rents by an amount that the rent guidelines board determines and those members of the rent guidelines board are appointed by the mayor. So he would essentially appoint these members and direct them to keep rents stable.""
Ketcham continued, ""Now, rents are already not covering increased operational costs for the owners of these rent-stabilized buildings and so the quality of the rent-stabilized housing stock is deteriorating rapidly and will continue to do so if the capital is not there to cover maintenance and operational costs. Roofs leak and boilers break. These things have to be fixed and there has to be enough in the rent increases to allow for these increased costs. If there isn't, then we're going to see a situation where tenants are living in worse and worse conditions each year.""
Ketcham told Fox News Digital that the situation raises the question, ""Is that the type of city that we want to create?""
""Or do we want a city where we have an abundance of new housing, where young people can feel like they have an option from among many different buildings and neighborhoods, where they can find the place that best suits their preferences and needs?"" Ketcham said.

Ketcham also said a key issue in the New York City housing market is that the city already has the largest public housing authority in the country, totaling 177,000 units. According to Ketcham, those residents are already ""truly suffering from gross mismanagement.""
""It takes our public housing Authority, NYSHA, 413 days to complete a repair on average,"" Ketcham said. ""It's so bad that our far-left public advocate, Jumaane Williams, has repeatedly called NYSHA the worst landlord in the city. So these are issues where we're looking at what kind of city is New York going to be? Is it going to a place that rewards aspiration and that tries to attract newcomers who want to live in conditions that are getting better every year? Or is it going to stay stagnant and simply appeal to those who seek security above all else?""

Mamdani, who has made lowering costs for New Yorkers a cornerstone of his campaign, has also proposed building 200,000 affordable housing units.
Mamdani's plan, aimed at tackling the tag team crisis of affordability and housing, includes an immediate freeze on more than 2 million rent-stabilized apartments.
Fox News Digital asked Ketcham if he thinks the housing situation will get worse under a Mamdani administration, and he replied, ""I do.""

Ketcham explained his belief that rent controls ""reduce the quality and the quantity of housing by reducing investment.""
""That's just the basic economics of it,"" Ketcham said. ""It's been tried in other cities like in Chicago and in St. Louis with Cabrini-Green and Pruitt-Igoe, which were historic failures in public housing.""
""The residents of these places have to contend with mold, rats and other vermin; they have all sorts of crime issues as well, so those experiments simply did not work. What does work is allowing the private sector to build a lot of new housing, including market-rate housing across the city and Mr. Mamdani's proposals are not necessarily amenable to that kind of private investment. In fact, he'd like to substitute in large part that private investment with public investment, public building projects.""

Adam Schiff, D-Calif., refused to answer repeated questions from Fox News Digital about his alleged mortgage fraud. (Credit: Nicholas Ballasy for Fox News Digital)
PresidentDonald Trumpcalled for California Democrat Sen. Adam Schiff to face jail time while invoking recently declassified documents alleging Obama administration officials ""manufactured and politicized intelligence"" to create the narrative that Russia was attempting to influence the 2016 presidential election.
""Adam ‘Shifty’ Schiff is in BIG TROUBLE!"" Trump posted to Truth Social Sunday evening. ""He falsified Loan Documents. He once said my son would go to prison on a SCAM that Schiff, along with other Crooked Dems, illegally ‘manufactured’ in order to stage an actual coup.""
""My son did nothing wrong, knew nothing about the fictional story,"" he added. ""It was an American Tragedy! Now Shifty should pay the price of prison for a real crime, not one made up by the corrupt accusers!""
Schiff is under scrutiny after the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sent a letter to the Department of Justice in May sounding the alarm that in ""multiple instances,""Schiff allegedly""falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments from 2003-2019 for a Potomac, Maryland-based property.""

FHFA is an independent federal agency that oversees Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
Schiff’s office did not respond to Fox News Digital’s request for comment Monday morning.
Trump publicly lambasted Schiff Tuesday over the alleged mortgage fraud, while Fannie Mae's financial crimes investigations concluded last week in a letter to the FHFA that Schiff allegedly engaged in ""a sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation"" on five Fannie Mae loans, Fox News Digital previously reported.
""I have always suspected Shifty Adam Schiff was a scam artist,"" Trump posted to Truth Social Tuesday. ""And now I learn that Fannie Mae’s Financial Crimes Division have concluded that Adam Schiff has engaged in a sustained pattern of possible Mortgage Fraud.""
""Adam Schiff said that his primary residence was in MARYLAND to get a cheaper mortgage and rip off America, when he must LIVE in CALIFORNIA because he was a Congressman fromCALIFORNIA. I always knew Adam Schiff was a Crook. The FRAUD began with the refinance of his Maryland property on February 6, 2009, and continued through multiple transactions until the Maryland property was correctly designated as a second home on October 13, 2020.""
Schiff has passed off the allegations as a continuation of Trump's history of slamming the liberal lawmaker.

""Since I led his first impeachment, Trump has repeatedly called for me to be arrested for treason,"" Schiff posted to X earlier in July after Trump first accused Schiff of mortgage fraud. ""So in a way, I guess this is a bit of a letdown. And this baseless attempt at political retribution won’t stop me from holding him accountable. Not by a long shot.""
WATCH: ADAM SCHIFF SILENT AFTER TRUMP ACCUSED HIM OF MORTGAGE FRAUD
Trump and Schiff have long been political foes, which was underscored during Trump's first administration when Schiff served as the lead House manager during the first impeachment trial against Trump in 2020, and when Schiff repeatedly promoted claims that Trump's 2016 campaigncolluded with Russia.
Days after Trump first posted about Schiff's mortgages in Maryland and California, the president's Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents that reportedly show ""overwhelming evidence"" that then-President Barack Obama and his national security team laid the groundwork for what would be the yearslong Trump–Russia collusion probeafter Trump's election win against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016.
""It lays out, these over 100 documents that you're referencing, that I declassified and released, spells out in great detail exactly what happens when you have some of the most powerful people in our country directly leading at the helm, President Obama and his senior-most national security cabinet, James Comey, John Brennan, James Clapper, and Susan Rice and others, essentially making a very intentional decision to create this manufactured, politicized piece of intelligence with the objective of subverting the will of the American people,"" Gabbardtold Fox News' Sean HannityFriday evening.

She argued that the goal of Obama and his team was to essentially ""not accept the decision of the American people"" in 2016, and to use this ""manufactured, politicized piece of intelligence"" as a means to enact a ""years-long coup against President Trump.""
Schiff was an incredibly vocal lawmaker amid the Russian collusion claims, most notably when the House censured him in 2023 over his promotion that Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia. Schiff served in the House representing California from 2001 to 2024, when he was sworn-in as a senator after his successful 2024 campaign to serve in the nation's upper chamber.

Schiff served as the ranking member of the House intelligence committee from 2015 to 2019, before becoming the committee's chair from 2019 to 2023. In that role, Schiff was kept up to date on classified materials surrounding the Russian collusion claims.
Schiff advocated in 2018 that Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, face a subpoena amid Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into claims Trump's 2016 campaign colluded with Russia to secure the election, which Trump cited in his latest Truth Social aimed at Schiff. Mueller's investigation, which wrapped up in March 2019, into the Russia claims determined there was no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.",7/21/2025
https://www.foxnews.com/media/mike-rowe-reveals-which-american-jobs-remain-untouched-coming-ai-revolution,Mike Rowe reveals which American jobs will remain untouched by the coming AI revolution,"MikeroweWORKS Foundation founder Mike Rowe joins 'The Brian Kilmeade Show' to discuss how AI and robots threaten white-collar jobs, as the nation faces a need for blue-collar workers.
Mike Rowe is sounding the alarm about the future of white and blue-collar jobs, and is urging young Americans to rethink their career choices due to threats from artificial intelligence.
The former star of the shows ""How America Works"" and ""Dirty Jobs"" sat down with Fox News Radio hostBrian Kilmeadeto discuss the outlook for the U.S. job market amid recent developments from PresidentDonald Trump'sadministration to invest in domestic energy and artificial intelligence.
LEE ZELDIN: TRUMP'S EPA CLEARING THE REGULATORY PATH FOR AMERICA TO DOMINATE THE GLOBAL AI REVOLUTION
Trump visited Pittsburgh on July 15 to announce a$90 billion investment in data centersand other energy projects in Pennsylvania.
Rowe was also present at the event, dubbed the Energy and Investment Summit, at Carnegie Mellon University. He praised the efforts by the federal government and Pennsylvania leaders as ""enormous.""
""The headlines have caught up to us in a way that is absolutely undeniable,"" Rowe said during the interview. ""This is an enormous play by Pennsylvania and [the two senators] [David] McCormick and [John] Fetterman, both of whom came together in a nonpartisan way to get behind this push.""
""I got invited simply to remind the crowd that creating jobs is very different from creating enthusiasm for those jobs.""

The founder of MikeroweWORKS warned that artificial intelligence is not necessarily coming for jobs like coal miners and trade jobs, but instead coders and the technology industry may be at a high risk.
""We have, for the last 30 years, been elevating our white-collar portion of the workforce at the expense of the blue-collar portion,"" Rowe said.
""We have been sort of intimating that the robots and the technology that is certainly on the horizon, if not already here, are coming for the blue-collar jobs. It’s turning out to be something quite the opposite- it's the white-collar positions.""
Rowe added that writing and creative-focused jobs have unstable outlooks due to automation.
""These are looking very wobbly right now,"" he said. ""The AI is going to come for those [jobs].""
AMERICA HAS THE POWER TO LEAD THE AI REVOLUTION – AND THE LEADERSHIP TO MAKE IT HAPPEN

However, Rowe cited the opportunity that the threat of white-collar positions brings to blue-collar ones. He expressed confidence that this resulting sea of change in the U.S. job market could bring about a ""golden age"" in trade positions.
""Short term, we are entering the golden age of plumbing, steam fitting, pipe fitting, welding, HVAC,"" Rowe explained. ""Those jobs are not going to be impacted by AI, and those are the jobs that are being created in Pennsylvania right now. And those are the opportunities that parents and guidance counselors ought to be zeroing in on.""
Rowe touted his foundation’s Work Ethic Scholarship program, which has seen an increase in applications over the last year, showcasing the national interest in young Americans for skilled trade jobs.
""My foundation is modest."" he said. ""We've given away about $13 million in these Work Ethic scholarships and this year we have 10 times the applicants that we did a year before.""
MIKE ROWE WARNS OF DECLINING WORK ETHIC PROBLEM AS YOUNGER GENERATION 'SNOWFLAKES' FACE FEWER CONSEQUENCES
Despite the apparent enthusiasm from adolescents for blue-collar jobs, Rowe emphasized the need to fill the hundreds of thousands of open positions, and continuing efforts to advertise those positions are imperative to steadying U.S. manufacturing efforts.
""We don't have an opportunity problem,"" he explained. ""And while we might have a skills gap, we also have a will gap. And if we don't, if we don't hit that thing head on, we're going to just keep pushing the boulder up the hill, I'm afraid.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/3-reasons-californias-green-energy-campaign-dying-vine,3 reasons California’s green energy campaign is dying on the vine,"Fix California senior advisor Katie Zacharia joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss why she considers the rail project a 'waste of tax dollars' and the latest on Democrats' effort to unmask ICE agents as they face growing threats.
California Democrat Governor GavinNewsom’s presidential aspirationsare Washington’s worst-kept secret. More than three years before the next election, he’s on the campaign trail in South Carolina, protesting immigration raids on cannabis farms and even politicizing the Second Family’s visit to Disneyland.
Before Newsom gets anywhere near Washington, he must ""confront his California problem,"" as even Politico observed. Blessed with incredible natural resources, the Golden State has the highest living costs in the nation. Nowhere is this trendmore evident than in energy,where there is a direct correlation between Newsom’s wrong-headed policies and overall unaffordability.
Here are three examples.
SOUTH CAROLINA GOP URGES TRUMP SUPPORTERS TO GIVE GAVIN NEWSOM A 'HUGE SOUTHERN WELCOME'
At $4.51 per gallon, California drivers already pay the most at the pump — that’s 45% higher than the national average, which hit a four-year low during the recent Independence Day holiday and kept dropping.
California gas prices continue to be far higher than the national average. FILE: Traffic jam during rush hour commute on the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California, USA.
As bad as that sounds, the pain is only just beginning. On July 1, motorists were hit with another 1.6-cent gas tax, andoverall gas taxesare expected to cost the average household $612 over the course of the year. A separate $0.05-$0.09 tax increase is expected not far behind. Newsom’s office touted the decline in gas prices by issuing a press release bragging about it.
Sadly, the latest gas tax could pale in comparison to other factors. Industry experts are projecting a gallon of gas potentially reaching $8 in the aftermath ofCalifornia refinery closures.
GAVIN NEWSOM IS MAKING A STRATEGIC VISIT TO A KEY PRIMARY STATE, RAISING EYEBROWS
For crude oil to become a usable petroleum product like gasoline, it must go through the refining process. Earlier this year, the Phillips 66 refinery in Los Angeles and the Valero refinery in Benicia announced plans to close by 2026, taking nearly 20% of the state’s total gasoline production with them, not to mention hundreds of jobs.
The trend is part of a sad and steady decline directly attributed to increasing red tape and regulations. During the 1980s, under the presidential administration of its former governor Ronald Reagan, California had as many as 43 operating refineries, a number that plummeted to just 14 last year, a drop of 67%. This is not for lack of resources. In fact, California has the fifth most oil reserves in the nation, outpacing places like Colorado and Oklahoma more often associated with the industry.
Newsom has denigrated the oil and gas industry as the ""polluted heart of this climate crisis."" He accused them of ""lying and gouging Californians"" and blamed them for ""more kids getting asthma.""

Along the way, he pursued policies aimed at making his state ""carbon neutral"" by 2045. That’s political speak for ending oil and gas entirely in favor of ""cleaner"" forms of energy like wind and solar, which are unreliable, untested and often rely on products from China (where roughly 80% of the world’s solar panels are manufactured).
STEVE HILTON: GAVIN NEWSOM'S $9 GAS NIGHTMARE LOOMS OVER THE GOLDEN STATE
A lynchpin of Newsom’s scheme was forcing drivers intoelectric vehicles.By 2035, less than a decade from now, 100% of vehicles sold in California were to be electric under a Newsom administration mandate that the U.S. Senate thankfully overturned in May.
As painful as the edict would have been for California’s nearly 40 million residents, the shockwaves were set to extend far and wide. As many as 13 states were on a track to follow where California was leading.

NEWSOM DEBUTS RAPID-RESPONSE WEBSITE AS CRITICS ACCUSE HIM OF PRIORITIZING PRESIDENTIAL AMBITIONS
To his political credit, Newsom appears aware of the unpopularity of some of his policies. He went on Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk’s podcast and turned heads by calling the concept of biological men competing in women’s sports ""unfair,"" but that demonstrates the powerthe green movement.

Newsom is far more likely to flip-flop on cultural issues than admit thegreen agendais failing his state. In the aftermath of President Donald Trump making the rollback of the EV mandates official, Newsom’s administration immediately took legal action and signed an executive order ""doubling down"" (his words) on his commitment to the nonsensical plan.
At the heart of the dissatisfaction with the Biden years was inflation and high costs of living, making it the top priority for more than six in 10 voters.Making energy expensivemade life expensive and Americans could not afford another four years of Biden/Harris energy policies. Newsom’s stubborn commitment to the failed green agenda, which has failed California spectacularly, should send his White House bid sputtering before it gets out of the starting gates.

Virginians recently learned that our commonwealth has lost our spot as ""America’s Top State for Business."" One major factor was singled out as leading to the downgrade — the widespread economic impact of DOGE’s attacks on the jobs of thousands of Virginians.
I’ve always supported responsible efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse — as well as corruption. In the U.S.House of Representatives, I even led the bipartisan push to ban members of Congress and their spouses from trading individual stocks. I believe that our leaders have a responsibility to restore trust in our government, make sure taxpayer dollars are used efficiently, and keep more money in people’s pockets.
But in the months since theTrump administration launched DOGE, I’ve been hearing from Virginians — across the political spectrum — who have lost their jobs or are worried their jobs will be targeted next. And I’m hearing from local business owners and contractors who are worried about their financial futures, as well as business leaders who are concerned about the long-term damage done to Virginia's economy; not just in northern Virginia, but in every corner of our commonwealth. We are home to more than 320,000 federal workers — not even including the private-sector workers who support federal contracts or the small business owners who are seeing Virginians cut back on family budgets.
LOOK BEYOND THE BIG APPLE'S SOCIALIST VICTORY TO FIND DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS IN 2025
It isn’t just federal workers who are taking a hit as a result of workforce cuts. A recent University of Virginia studyprojectsthat more than 32,000 Virginia jobs will be lost over the course of 2025 in large part because of DOGE. These include federal jobs, manufacturing jobs, food service jobs — real Virginians’ jobs across many industries.

The new ""America’s Top States for Business"" rankings make one thing clear: theTrump administration's approachis not working for Virginia. This year, the results specifically cited the disproportionate impacts of the president’s actions surrounding federal job cuts, but we haven’t seen meaningful guidance from our statewide leaders for Virginians whose lives were upended.
Earlier this year, our governor and lieutenant governor told Virginians who have lost their jobs to simply update their resumes and log on to LinkedIn. That isn’t leadership.
Virginia’s lieutenant governor, who is also asking Virginians to let her serve as their next governor, has repeatedly laughed off Virginians’ job losses. She offered these words of advice: ""don’t fret."" I don’t think Virginians in the throes of an unanticipated job search would call that leadership.

This year’s rankings make clear that Virginia’s economy remains under threat, and we need a governor who has a plan to build a more resilient economy. Virginians deserve a governor who will put Virginia’s economy first in the face of ongoing threats, no matter if it’s a Democrat or a Republican in theWhite House.
If elected to serve as Virginia’s next governor, I will take action to make sure Virginia is the best place in the country to start or grow a business. I will focus on leveraging our commonwealth’s strengths to attract new investment. Not only will we champion economic development in every corner of Virginia, including our rural communities, but we will focus on the strengths that keep businesses here — including our world-class community colleges and universities, our infrastructure, and our strong workforce.

The U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) said Thursday it was adding ""enhanced oversight"" of agency decisions about new wind and solar projects in an effort to end ""favoritism"" of these ""unreliable"" and ""subsidy-dependent"" energy systems from the previous administration.
The new directive updates review procedures that will require senior leadership at the Interior Department, including the office of the secretary, to conduct a final review of any relevant decisions, including leases, rights-of-way, construction and operation plans, grants, consultations and biological opinions.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-admin-tackles-urgent-electrical-grid-crisis-ai-set-double-demand,Trump admin tackles urgent electrical grid crisis as AI set to double demand,"Fox News anchor Bret Baier examines the U.S. power supply on 'Special Report.'
Over the next two decades,global electricity demandis expected to double, growth we haven’t seen since post-World War II.
To meet historic projections, we need to generate abundant, reliable and affordable energy at a massive scale. But new generation won’t be enough. We must dramatically modernize the country’selectrical grid infrastructure, the invisible backbone of our entire energy system.
Transforming this aging infrastructure – which has been built up over a century – into a state-of-the art system is critical if the U.S. is to maintain its competitive lead on the global stage.
This electrical grid issue was front and center at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, where President Donald Trump, members of his Cabinet and industry leaders discussed the key steps we must prioritize across the energy industry.
It is hard to overstate the urgency: America’s economy is only as strong as the grids that power it.
CHINA IS EXPLOITING OUR GOVERNMENT'S TECH WEAKNESS. WE NEED A RAPID REBOOT
TheEnergy Departmentreinforced this view last week, saying in a report: ""Electricity demand from AI-driven data centers and advanced manufacturing is rising at a record pace. The magnitude and speed of projected load growth cannot be met with existing approaches to load addition and grid management.""
Energy Secretary Chris Wright added a more personal view to the issue, saying, ""We produce energy for one reason, which is to better people's lives. So having a reliable grid that's as affordable as possible and that can grow so we can bring industry and more job opportunities to our states and communities is just critical.""
I couldn’t agree more. Boosting investments in the grid will expand high-tech U.S. manufacturing, create jobs and develop a stronger domestic supply chain. For the U.S. to truly lead the world in energy, manufacturing electrification infrastructure here at home is just as important as increased generation.
WE HAVE TO ACT NOW TO KEEP AI FROM BECOMING A FAR-LEFT TROJAN HORSE
This issue was front and center at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit earlier this week, where PresidentDonald Trump, members of his Cabinet and industry leaders discussed the key steps we must prioritize across the energy industry.
The grid we have today wasn't designed for the world we're building. Originally conceived in the early 20th century for electricity to travel in one direction, the grid now faces volatile, multi-directional energy flows. Peak demand is higher. Extreme weather more uncertain. Sources are more distributed.
While our systems are strong, the pressures we're putting on it are unlike anything earlier generations ever imagined.
But this challenge can be a historic moment for huge progress, not just incremental improvements. It’s why we are adding $100 million in investments and 700 new jobs over the next two years and expanding capacity at our leading grid solutions factories in Pennsylvania.
SILICON, STEEL AND MEGAWATTS: CAN AMERICA CREATE THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO WIN THE AI RACE?
The new roles and addedmanufacturing volumewill help support building more high-voltage switchgear products, critical components for stable and reliable operation of the nation’s electrical grids.
Energy-intensive, next-gen industries like high-tech manufacturing and AI will locate where they can access reliable, efficient power. Communities and countries that modernize their grids will attract investment and jobs, and those that don't will watch opportunities move elsewhere.
The bottom line – if we build a smarter, stronger electrical grid, our economy will grow faster, we willcreate more jobsand American families will save money.

So what can we do? The first step is to recognize the urgency that drives bold, sustained investment, since the International Energy Agency estimates we must double grid investment by 2030 to meet demand.
Second is stronger public-private partnerships. Smart policies from the federal government are crucial, but companies like ours must be prepared to make the investments to build the factories and hire the workers that are needed.
Third is accelerated permitting reform. Right now, it takes longer to get approval to build a transmission line than it does to actually build it, delaying access to bringing more power online, slowing job creation and holding back communities from modernizing their energy systems. We need to supercharge grid upgrades, not bury them in red tape.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Embracing new technologies will also be critical.Applying AI, advanced software and machine learning to grid management offers utilities the capability to process vast amounts of data in real-time, enabling better decision-making, optimization of existing infrastructure and smarter load management.
When the lights first came on, it helped power decades of prosperity. Now, this Age of Electricity will determine whether we can power a sustainable future for America and bring affordable energy to everyone who needs it.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/retailers-caught-red-handed-using-trumps-tariffs-cover-price-gouging,Retailers caught red-handed using Trump's tariffs as cover for price gouging,"Council of Economic Advisors Chair Steve Miran joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss why tariffs have not prompted consumer prices to rise as President Donald Trump continues to broker deals with U.S. trading partners.
In recent weeks, headlines have been filled with warnings from major retailers about impending price hikes due totariffs reinstatedby President Donald Trump. Big Box stores likeWalmartand Target have been quick to suggest that tariffs on imported goods, particularly from China, have left them with no choice but to raise prices for American families.
Let’s be clear, these decisions are more about raising profit margins and going against Trump’s agenda to bring costs down for Americans than responding to any actualeconomic pressure.
Tariffs are a strategic tool. TheTrump administration has always been clearabout that. Tariffs are designed to level the playing field, incentivize domestic production, counter predatory trade practices – especially from the Chinese Communist Party – and put America First. Tariffs protect long-term American interests, especially in vital industries like technology and manufacturing.
TARIFF CASE PITS CATO INSTITUTE AGAINST TRUMP OVER ‘UNLIMITED’ EXECUTIVE POWER UNDER EMERGENCY LAW
Yet, many corporations are using tariffs as a convenient scapegoat to raise prices across the board, even on products not impacted by new trade policies. A recentFederal Reservereport found that retailers have increased prices on non-tariffed items, falsely implying that across-the-board cost pressures are tariff-driven. This is not only wrong, it’s exploitative.

We all know many of these large retailers are sitting on comfortable, even expanded, profit margins because of the price hikes from COVID-19 that never came down. But it’s not enough for them. They want to fleece the American consumer and blame it on President Trump’s America First agenda.
Former Walmart CEO Bill SimonacknowledgedWalmart's capability to eat the costs of these tariffs rather than throwing the burden to the consumer: ""[T]his quarter they grew their gross profit margin in the US business 25 basis points … All that product that has the tariffs on it, they reported last quarter actually went down in price. That sort of gives them room in my view to manage any tariff impact that they would have.""
WHITE HOUSE DENIES TARIFFS PROMPTING INFLATION AS TRUMP PUSHES FOR TRADE DEALS
Despite Simon’s admission, Walmart has already issuedpricehikesunder the guise of tariff costs.
What we’re witnessing is a pattern of deflection. Rather than own up to their pricing strategies, many businesses are choosing to shift the blame onto the Trump administration’s economic policy. This tactic is not only dishonest, it’s harmful to public discourse. It creates the false impression that Trump administration policies are causing this, when in reality, many of these pricing decisions are being driven by corporate boards more concerned with shareholder satisfaction than consumer welfare.
Let’s be honest: these companies are not victims of President Trump’s trade policy. They are powerful corporations who get to thrive in a free-market economy that the U.S. provides for them. But they’re exploiting it. If they wanted to protect their customers from modest cost increases, they could. Instead, they’re choosing to use tariffs, often on a small subset of goods, as an excuse to raise prices on a much larger range of products.
TRUMP THREATENS 35% TARIFF ON CANADIAN GOODS OVER DANGEROUS CROSS-BORDER FENTANYL DISPUTE
The other fact the retailers consistently ignore is their role in why we need the tariffs to begin with. Major retailers have profited from the shift to outsourcing to China in recent decades. They should now bear the burden of the environment they helped create, and Americans agree.

The Protecting America Initiative, a conservative organization I work with that focuses on combating the threat of the CCP, recently polled general election voters and found that a majority of Americans are concerned that our nation’s largest retailers are using tariffs as an excuse to hike prices.
Yet, many corporations are using tariffs as a convenient scapegoat to raise prices across the board, even on products not impacted by new trade policies.
Fifty-two percent of Americans also agree with Trump when he says retailers should bear the burden of any cost increases associated with the tariffs. Our data also shows that consumers want both government officials at the federal and state levels to implement accountability measures to stop retailers from artificially hiking prices.

By turning tariffs into a political talking point, some corporations are playing directly into the hands of our enemies, like China, which doesn’t mind if American companies use tariffs as a scapegoat because it distracts from their unfair trade practices and puts pressure on the U.S. to back down.

The Trump administration has never hidden the rationale for its tariff strategy. It's about America FIRST, national strength and economic independence. This is not a radical position, it’s – as President Trump says – common sense. And it’s supported by millions of Americans who understand that supporting""Made in America"" manufacturingis vital for the future of our country.
Retailers should stop hiding behind tariffs and start being honest with consumers. If you're raising prices, say so. But don’t pretend you’re being forced to act by government policy when the numbers say otherwise. Support a made-in-America future instead of working against it.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-refines-eeoc-approach-transgender-workplace-discrimination-claims,Trump administration refines EEOC approach to transgender workplace discrimination claims,"EEOC Commissioner Andrea Lucas explains employment law regarding diversity and her response to Mark Cuban's DEI hiring claim.
The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency responsible for enforcing laws against workplace discrimination, will allow some complaints by transgender workers to proceed, a change from earlier guidance that indefinitely halted cases alleging workplace discrimination against transgender people.
An email was sent earlier this month to leaders of the EEOC in which Thomas Colclough, director of the agency’s Office of Field Programs, said if new transgender worker complaints involve ""hiring, discharge or promotion, you are clear to continue processing these charges.""
Even with the change, those complaints will still face higher scrutiny than other workplace discrimination cases, requiring approval from acting EEOC chair Andrea Lucas, who was appointed by PresidentDonald Trumpearlier this year.
Lucas has said one of her priorities would be ""defending the biological and binary reality of sex and related rights.""

Since Trump returned to the presidency in January, the EEOC has shifted away from its previous interpretation of civil rights law that included prohibiting workplace discrimination against people based on their gender identity.
This comes after the agency issued a landmark finding a decade ago that a transgendercivilian employeeof the U.S. Army had faced discrimination when her employer refused to use the worker's preferred pronouns or allow the individual to use bathrooms based on gender identity rather than biological sex.
Under Lucas' authority, the EEOC has dropped several lawsuits alleging discrimination against transgender workers. Lucas defended that decision during her Senate committee confirmation hearing last month, citing Trump's executive order stating that there are only two sexes — male and female.
But she also acknowledged that the 2020 Supreme Court ruling Bostock v. Clayton County ""did clearly hold that discriminating against someone on the basis of sex included firing an individual who is transgender or based on their sexual orientation.""

Colclough said in his email that the EEOC will consider transgender discrimination complaints that ""fall squarely under"" theSupreme Court'sruling, including cases involving hiring, firing and promotion, which reversed an earlier policy that de-prioritized cases filed on behalf of transgender workers.
""Under federal law, charge inquiries and charges of discrimination made to the EEOC are confidential,"" an EEOC spokesperson told The Associated Press, while declining to comment on the specifics of its updated policy.
""Pursuant to Title VII and as statutorily required, the EEOC is, has been, and will continue to accept and investigate charges on all bases protected by law, and to serve those charges to the relevant employer,"" the spokesperson added.
But even the cases the EEOC will consider under the Supreme Court ruling must still be reviewed by a senior attorney advisor and sent to Lucas for final approval.
The expanded review process for transgender cases is not typical of other discrimination complaints and reflects the agency’s increased scrutiny of these cases, according to former EEOC commissioner Chai Feldblum, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama.

""It is a slight improvement because it will allow certain claims of discrimination to proceed,"" Feldblum told The Associated Press. ""But overall it does not fix a horrific and legally improper situation currently occurring at the EEOC.""
Colclough's email did not clarify how long the review process might take, or whether cases that include additional claims, such as harassment or retaliation, would be eligible to proceed, and the EEOC declined to address those questions.
""This is not the EEOC being clear to either its own staff or to the public what charges are going to be processed,"" Feldblum said. ""This is not a panacea.""

Republican lawmakers plan to introduce legislation to revoke the federal charter of the National Education Association (NEA) over concerns about its political priorities.
North Carolina Rep. Mark Harris and Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn revealed on Tuesday inThe Daily Callerthat they will each introduce the National Education Association Charter Repeal Act in their respective chambers. The bill aims to revoke the federal charter for the largest teachers’ union in the country.
The new legislation came after reports that the NEA had been prioritizing politics over education at its annual meeting earlier this month.

""From branding President Trump a fascist to embracing divisive gender ideology and walking away from efforts to fight antisemitism, the NEA has become nothing more than a partisan advocacy group,"" Harris told The Daily Caller. ""Since the NEA is clearly not prioritizing students, parents or even teachers, it’s time to remove Congress’ seal of approval from this rogue organization.""
Harris confirmed the report onhis X accountwhile also mentioning ten other House Republicans who have co-sponsored the bill.
Fox News Digitalreached out to Harris and Blackburn for further comment.

A survivor of a Sunday blaze that tore through an assisted living facilityin Massachusettshas claimed that staff members abandoned the burning scene leaving the elderly residents to fend for themselves – while another said that workers didn’t even knock at doors to alert the seniors as the flames spread.
Resident Lorraine Ferrara, 70, told the Associated Press of her shock to see staff running away from the fire that ultimately killed 9 people and injured dozens more at Gabriel House in Fall River.
""They left us alone and ran,"" Ferrara said. ""I was hanging out the window — ‘Help! Help!’ — and they just kept running.""

Meanwhile, resident Robert Cabral also said that workers fled the terrifying scene as smoke filled rooms.

Fox News Digital reached out to Gabriel Care, the operators of the facility, for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
The deceased were aged 61 to 86.The facilityopened in 1999 and had 100 units with about 70 people residing there at the time.
As well as workers apparently fleeing the scene, reports have emerged of an alleged lack of fire drills at the facility, while a firefighters union said inadequate staffing hindered the response to the blaze.
Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts Secretary of Elder Affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, said the group was concerned by reports about the apparent lack of fire drills as well a low number of staff for a highly dependent population and safety issues such as a broken elevator and air conditioners in the windows.
""It’s a terrible tragedy that should have never happened,"" Lanzikos told the Associated Press.

Edward Kelly, president of the national firefighters union, said eight additional firefighters would have been on scene if national staffing recommendations were followed.
Capt. Frank O'Reagan said there was no breathing equipment available when he arrived, so he started going door to door on the third floor without an air tank until the smoke got to him.
O'Reagan's brother and fellow firefighter Michael O'Reagan said he was shocked that 40 minutes after firefighters arrived, a large part of the building had not been searched.
""We did the best we could with what we had, and what we had was not enough,"" said Michael O'Reagan, president of the Fall River firefighters union.

Fixing them should be Job No. 1 for America,"FOX Business' Taylor Riggs joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss her take on the June jobs report, Democrats' attacks against the legislation and why they claim it will target Medicaid.
This summer should be bringing the Class of 2025 a moment of well-deserved relaxation before they launch their careers. Instead, far too many college and high-school graduates are filled with anxiety. They’ve applied for dozens, perhaps hundreds, of jobs, but interviews and offers have become increasingly rare.
The national unemployment rate for young adults aged 20 to 24 looking for work is 6.6% — the highest level in a decade, excluding the pandemic unemployment spike. Among those without college degrees the situation is even more dire: The unemployment rate for high-school graduates aged 18 to 19 is 14.5%.
The precipitous reduction of entry-level hiring has been blamed ontariff-induced economic uncertaintyand employers betting thatartificial intelligence advanceswill reduce labor needs. Once there is greater clarity on both fronts, many expect hiring to increase.

A major new studyby research consultancy HarrisX, funded by our family foundation, reveals thatschool-to-work pathwaysfor millions of young Americans — both those with and withoutcollege degrees —are far more deeply fractured than previously known, posing a significant threat to building the future workforce essential to growing the U.S. economy.
More than four in 10 young people say both theeducation systemand the employment resources to which they have access are broken and not providing them effective guidance. And they worry employment will become even more difficult as AI impacts the job market: Nearly half said they feel unprepared, or are unsure of their preparation, for jobs of the future.

The study reveals how a broad swath of Generation Z between 16 and 24 years old remains far from tapping its full potential because of systemic inertia that leaves too many young people stranded at the start of their careers.
Many young people are not being adequately served by the institutions they encounter at every stage of their journey into adulthood, fromhigh schoolsthat do not expose students to a range of careers and non-college training pathways to achieve goodjobs,to employers who are unwilling to invest in building hard and soft skills among new hires.
This broken marketplace has significant consequences for the future of the U.S. economy, particularly efforts by the Trump administration toincrease domestic industrial production,which will require a larger pipeline of skilled workers.
Our nation has millions of open jobs — more than 7 million of them, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The problem for theClass of 2025,and many other jobseekers, is that the skills taught in our high schools and colleges aren’t aligned with what many businesses need, especially advanced manufacturers.
NEARLY HALF OF GEN Z ADMITS TO LYING ON JOB APPLICATIONS, SURVEY FINDS
Many of those unfilled jobs — and more so in the future — require applicants to possess more than just a high-school or college degree. Yet too many young adults lack the guidance and resources to acquire the necessary skills and credentials.
Too often, adults fault young people for not demonstrating more initiative and gumption in their journey into working life. But everyone who engages with young adults is responsible:

One of the innovations at Starbucks of which we are most proud has nothing to do with coffee. It was the decision to offer every Starbucks barista the opportunity to launch new careers by enrolling online at Arizona State University for free. To date, more than 16,000 of them have graduated with bachelor’s degrees — vaulting many into new roles inside and outside the company, with an average pay increase of $40,000 within 18 months.
The alarming headline about recent graduates should bolt us out of our complacency. Too many of our systems were designed for a different era. The old model of earning a degree and staying with one employer for decades no longer fits today’s dynamic workforce.
The challenge now is to build a better marketplace — one that is nimble, forward-looking, and grounded in the realities of a global, tech-driven economy. That marketplace requires embracing the power of AI to help repair what it is destroying:AI-powered agentsand other tech tools that can help young people navigate options with more clarity.

As the multi-state worker strike approaches the two-week mark, the garbage collection company involved in the unrest is being urged by state leaders across the country to finalize a contract and restore services.
Republic Services told Fox News Digital that they are ""working to resume regular trash collection as quickly as possible.""

Despite the involvement of a federal mediator, recent negotiations between Republic Services and Teamsters,the union representingthe garbage collectors, have ended without resolution.
Last week, Teamsters General President Sean O’Brien escalated tensions by threatening to disrupt waste collection operations across multiple states. The strike has disrupted trash collection in 14 Massachusetts communities served by Republic, primarily along the North Shore.
O’Brien declared ""war"" on Republic Services, warning that the union plans to ""flood the streets and shut down garbage collection in state after state.""
""Republic Services has been threatening a war with American workers for years — and now, they’ve got one,""O’Brien said in a statement.""Republic abuses and underpays workers across the country. They burn massive profits and funnel money to undeserving, corrupt executives.""

O'Brien said the Teamsters ""have had it with Republic.""
""We will flood the streets and shut down garbage collection in state after state. Workers are uniting nationwide, and we will get the wages and benefits we’ve earned, come hell or high water.""
Teamsters claimed that Republic Services had refused to settle fair contracts, despite months of negotiations in cities around the country.
""Republic Services doesn’t run without its hardworking Teamsters. This strike forced on workers by the multibillion-dollar corporation is resulting in trash pileups and collection disruptions for scores of people across the country,"" the organization wrote in a post on X.
""But Teamsters at Republic will not back down until they’ve gotten the fair contracts they’ve rightfully earned.""
In the meantime,numerous Massachusetts townsand businesses are facing mounting piles of uncollected garbage. Republic claimed the union wasn't negotiating in good faith, while the Teamsters accused the company of abandoning talks and refusing to continue over the weekend.
""Unfortunately, the Teamsters did not take the negotiations seriously and refused to make any meaningful progress,"" the company told Fox News Digital.
""Today, we made a formal proposal that included a nearly 16% wage increase immediately and an approximate 43% pay increase over five years for our Greater Boston employees. Contrary to the many falsehoods the Teamsters are spreading, our offer outpaces competitors.""
Another round of discussions is set for Tuesday as workers are calling for better wages, improved benefitsand enhanced job protections.
Nationally, over 2,000 Teamsters are either actively striking or observing picket lines. The Republic Services Teamsters began striking on July 3 on the East Coast.

The company said it is facing union-related work stoppages at six locations, including two business units in Boston and four additional sites in Cumming, Georgia; Ottawa, Illinois; Manteca, California, and Lacey, Washington. The Teamsters union has also expanded picketing to several other locations, with many employees at those sites honoring the picket lines, the company said.
While the company claims that garbage pickup is continuing in all affected areas, many residents and businesses report delays and inconsistent service. Republic’s commercial clients, such as restaurants, are also grappling with waste collection issues.
Massachusetts Secretary of State Bill Galvin sent a formal letter Friday to Republic Services President Jon Vander Ark, criticizing the company for halting active negotiations and imposing hardship on communities. In the letter,obtained by Boston.com,Galvin called for more intense efforts to reach a deal and suggested that the situation might require greater government oversight of the waste management sector.
He emphasized that essential public services like trash collection shouldn’t hinge on the strategies of a private corporation, and questioned whether oversight of such services should remain in the hands of private firms.
Boston City Councilors Erin Murphy, John FitzGerald and Ed Flynn echoed these sentiments in a separate letter to Vander Ark. The trio, who spearheaded a City Council resolution supporting the Teamsters, said the union’s demands were fair and accused Republic of failing to meet fundamental labor standards.

Republic countered that it had proposed a nearly 16% immediate pay raise and a total increase of around 43% over five years. The company accused the union of spreading misinformation and asserted its wage offers exceed those of competitors.
""Don’t believe the union’s false narrative – 45% of our Greater Boston drivers represented by the Teamsters earned more than $100,000 last year, based on W-2 data,"" the company said. ""If the Teamsters accepted the offer we made today, drivers would make approximately $140,000 per year, by the end of the contract.""
In addition, the company claimed that they ""pay 100% of the health and welfare premiums for our Greater Boston employees"" and ensured that they have a comprehensive health and welfare plan.
The company said that the mediator requested both sides return to mediation on Tuesday, July 15, and both parties agreed.
""We are confident that our most recent proposal meets all of our employees’ demands, and we expect the Teamsters to bargain in the best interest of our employees.""

Beef prices in the U.S. continue to hit record highs, yet demand for the popularsummer grilling stapleremains strong — prompting shoppers, farmers and restaurants to adapt.
A pound of ground beef cost $6.67 just before theFourth of Julyweekend, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), marking the highest price for beef ever recorded by the group.
It was up nearly 70 cents from May, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported it skyrocketed 16% from a year earlier and nearly 50% from five years ago.
MCDONALD'S PRICES FROM 1991 IGNITE DISCUSSION AMONG NOSTALGIC MILLENNIALS: 'IT TASTED BETTER, TOO'
""The main factors for our higher beef prices this year are driven by supply, demand and financial elements like higher interest rates,"" said Paul Savage, director of commodities forecasting at Chicago-based ArrowStream, which provides supply chain technologyto restaurants.
A key driver behind the rising prices is the shrinking cattle population.
The price of ground beef skyrocketed 16% from last year.(iStock)
The national herd has declined to 86.7 million head, the lowest since 1951, according to the AFBF.
Prolonged droughts in cattle-producing states like Texas, Kansas and Nebraska have devastated grazing pastures, forcing many farmers to cull their herds.
At the same time, rising tariffs and ongoing trade disruptions have made cattle production more costly.

Additionally, cases ofthe New World Screwworm– a parasitic fly whose maggots burrow into and feed on the flesh of cattle – halted imports from Mexico to the U.S., though the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) said some ports could reopen soon.
The U.S. gets most of its cattle imports from Mexico and Canada.
""The rising cost of ground beef is a perfect example of how global trade dynamics and domestic supply constraints collide,"" Robert Khachatryan, founder and CEO of California-based Freight Right Global Logistics, told Fox News Digital.

""Transporting cattle, which often involves multiple cross-country moves between birth, feedlots and processing, has become more costly due to fuel volatility and ongoing driver shortages in the freight sector,"" Khachatryan said.
""From ranch to processor to store shelf, every leg of the journey is costlier, and that cumulative pressure is showing up right on the price tag.""
The USDA predicts that cattle prices will remain elevated into 2026, meaning retail beef prices likely won't drop for several years. Nonetheless, it remains Americans'second-favorite choice of meat, according to the USDA, with nearly 57 pounds of it being consumed per person annually.
THIS BREAKFAST MISTAKE MAKES PEOPLE REACH FOR SUGARY SNACKS IN THE AFTERNOON
While factors such as population growth, recently expanded food assistance benefits and the popularity ofhigh-protein dietsare contributing to slightly higher demand, overall consumption has not dramatically spiked.
""We're producing roughly the same amount of beef that we did in 2015 but, given a higher population, supply is tight,"" Savage said.
The U.S. population reached 340.1 million in July 2024, up from 336.8 million from the year before, marking the highest year-over-year increase since 2001, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

In the meantime, the U.S. is importing more beef from Australia, New Zealand and Brazil, Savage said, and limiting beef exports to other countries to help stabilize supply. Farmers are also growing bigger animals to offset the lower cattle harvest.

Shoppers are seeking out more affordable cuts such as chuck, round and top sirloin, Savage said, though it has driven up their prices more than premium options like strip steaks.
Some grocery store chains are leaning into beef and pork blends, chicken-focused products and seasonal promotions to steer shoppers toward more affordable proteins, according to Khachatryan.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newsom-just-took-page-from-trump-theres-more-do-keep-california-golden-state,Newsom just took a page from Trump. But there’s more to do to keep California a golden state,"President Donald Trump said California Gov. Gavin Newsom should visit Florida's ""Alligator Alcatraz"" and ""learn something"" during his tour of the new migrant detention facility.
California Democrat Governor Gavin Newsomtook a page out ofDonald Trump’s playbooklate in June by approving an overhaul of his state’s costly and unnecessary environmental regulations.
Newsom’s signature updated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a 1970s-era law that forces developers and homeowners to undergo an absurdly expensive and long environmental review before starting any building project. Among other things, the update streamlines the review process and exempts huge swaths of the state’s infrastructure construction from the ancient regulatory statutes.
Critics and the homebuilding industry have long blamed this cumbersome policy for California’s long-runninghousing shortage,sky-high real estate prices, and even the state’sinfamous homelessness problem.As a free-market economist, I applaud Newsom for defanging some of his state’s most burdensome measures – but he should go much further to a) help his constituents and b) shore up his national moderate bona fides as he likely runs for president in 2028.
ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISTS COMPLAIN CALIFORNIA DEMOCRATS HAVE 'BACKED DOWN' ON CLIMATE CHANGE
For example, his signature left the ""CEQA abuse"" loophole untouched. This is a regulation which allows labor unions and NIMBY (Not in My Backyard) activists to file frivolous environmental lawsuits that delay projects and run up development costs. Environmentalists often pretend these suits are about protecting animals and trees, but they’re primarily a means of harming companies these radicals don’t like.
Gov. Gavin Newsom made a good start on housing rules, but environmental lawsuits still pose a big problem. FILE: Newsom speaks at a news conference in Oakland, Calif.(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)
And the radicals aren’t just holding up signs. They’re in elected offices, abusing their power for the sake of their agendas instead of serving constituents. That’s what a court ruled in 2022 after two local governments stopped ""much-needed housing"" for decades. The court also said that CEQA was intended for narrow use, and that its abuse was holding up progress within the state, especially related to easing the problem of lowhousingsupply.
Those lawsuits impact more than the rich company owners. They prevent young families from achieving the American Dream by making first homes too expensive to own and maintain. That’s another piece of low-hanging regulatory fruit for Newsom, because his CEQA reform focused on urban apartments and large infrastructure projects – important to millions of Californians, but also ignoring more structural reforms to the issue of expensive housing.
SUPREME COURT LIMITS JUDGES' AUTHORITY TO BLOCK INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS OVER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS
Since one of the primary drivers of California’s population decline is the high cost of living, allowing developers to build more single-family homes would encourage more people to rent or buy the type of home they want to flee to – or did end up fleeing to. Many formerCaliforniaresidents might even return from affordable states like Texas, Arizona and Tennessee.

Finally, there’s trash collection. This one doesn’t earn the same flashy headlines as environmental policy, crime or homelessness, but California has quietly (and expensively) been struggling in this area, too.
The California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle) currently employs a Byzantine system of greenhouse gas emissions standards and penalty schemes that squeeze privately owned landfills without reducing the amount of trash to process.

Not only does this force California taxpayers to cover the higher cost of transporting their garbage to faraway landfills, but it’s put some landfills out of business. Late last year, theChiquita Canyon Landfillannounced that it would no longer be accepting waste, eliminating a critical option for Angelenos’ trash disposal.

Newsom can’t solve the entire landfill problem by himself, as many counties employ their own ridiculous landfill and environmental regulations. But his bully pulpit and influence with local and county lawmakers could get those entities to fall into line and create affordable waste disposal services for all those new homes.
People vote with their feet, and millions of people have voted against California in recent decades by moving to more affordable states. GovernorGavin Newsomshould be commended for getting his party to accept reforms to California’s notoriously burdensomeenvironmental review laws.However, there is much more work to be done to stem the California exodus … not to mention to elevate a 2028 Newsom presidential run.

Have you ever thought your dream house could offer skyline views without sacrificing style or space?
Do you prefer the verticality of city apartments but wish you could also own a standalone home? These innovative prefab towers from the German company Moduleform make that possible.
Named the DQ Tower, this micro-living residence is designed for backyards and small urban lots. With three stories, two bedrooms, two bathrooms, and high-end built-in features, it brings a sleek new take oncompact living, even if it comes at a premium price.

HOW 432 ROBOTS ARE RELOCATING A 7,500-TON HISTORIC BUILDING
DQ Tower(Moduleform)
With three full stories of living space, the DQ Tower stands over 28 feet tall. However, all that vertical space only takes up a footprint of just 13 by 13 feet. It's designed for tight urban plots orbackyard spaces, and instead of spreading out like a traditional mobile tiny home, it rises straight up.
DQ Tower(Moduleform)
The ground floor opens up into a spacious living and dining area. A comfy sofa pulls double duty as both seating and an optional spare sleeping space. A comfortable dining nook sits next to a kitchenette complete with an induction stove, sink, and refrigerator. The floor-to-ceiling glass windows give plenty of natural light and open up the space even further. The ground floor rounds out with a half bathroom with a convenient washing machine included.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?
Climbing the staircase to the second floor, you will find the first cozy bedroom complete with a single bed and a built-in wardrobe. On the second floor is also a full bathroom with a standing shower. And yes, the ceilings are quite tall and spacious, avoiding the cramped loft designs of other tiny homes.
The third floor is the showstopper. As you ascend the steel and wood staircase, the master bedroom sits comfortably with a double bed, an even larger wardrobe, and a small desk for a working area. The tall windows up here continue to provide light and ventilation, making the most of the compact space while providing breathtaking views.
DQ Tower(Moduleform)
In total, the DQ Tower offers nearly 420 square feet of living space. That is a reasonable accommodation for a couple or small family, or anyone who appreciates the efficiency of downsizing. Another option, and one that the manufacturers advertise, is the DQ Tower, which fits comfortably in the backyard, making for a cost-effective and low-impact guest house, perfect for rental sites like Airbnb.  And with two bathrooms and two bedrooms, it's surprisingly livable for such a small footprint.

The major convenience and cost-cutting feature of these tiny tower homes is thatthey come prefabricated. They are built off-site in Germany, transported to the site, and settled into place with a small crane crew. As of now, it takes about eight months from order to delivery. The whole structure is constructed with a sturdy steel frame, well-insulated walls, and clad in chic aluminum panels.
DQ Tower(Moduleform)
The starting price for these private towers is currently roughly $176,000.   Now, that is nearly twice the per-square-foot cost of other tiny homes. However, the DQ Tower offers ultra-high-quality, designer-level micro-living with a sleek and accommodating design.
The DQ Tower is more than just a tiny home. It offers a bold vision for how people can live in smaller spaces without giving up comfort or style. Although it is not currently available in the United States, it provides a clear picture of where compact, vertical living could be headed. As cities become more crowded and backyard space gains value, this European design could inspire the next generation of American prefab housing.

The largest teachers' union in the nation was mocked on social media this week after misspelling the word ""fascism"" in a resolution passed on Sunday promising to ""defend democracy"" against PresidentDonald Trump.
The National Education Association (NEA) put forward the misspelled proposal at the union's annual convention on Sunday, pledging to defend ""the survival of civilization itself"" to its more than 3 million members.
""NEA pledges to defend democracy against Trump’s embrace of fascism by using the term facism [sic] in NEA materials to correctly characterize Donald Trump’s program and actions,"" the agenda item read, which wasposted to social mediaby conservative education expert Corey A. DeAngelis.

""The members and material resources of NEA must be committed to the defense of the democratic and educational conditions required by our hopes for a just society and the survival of civilization itself by stating the truth,"" the proposal continued.
""Yes, the union that claims to represent educators couldn’t even spell ‘fascism’ correctly in its official resolution attacking the president,""DeAngelis wrotein a Fox News Digital opinion piece, adding, ""The irony is almost too rich to parody.""
It didn't take long for many others on social media to also see the humor after the union's spelling error was revealed.
One X user warned that America's institutions are being controlled by ""fringe political activists"" after theteachers' unionmoved to use the term ""fascism"" as a formal description of the Trump administration.

CEO and co-founder of Moms for Liberty, Tina Descovich, mocked the union for not being able to properly define fascism in their proposal, and opting to teach the nation's children about partisan politics rather than math and reading.
Rep. Jim Walsh, R-Wash., chimed in with his opinion, ripping the union for misspelling the key word in their ""hysterical slander"" of the current president.
One user kept it short and to the point: ""Not only are they ideologues, they can't spell.""
Chip Rogers, CEO of the workers' advocacy group Americans for Fair Treatment, argued that teachers' money should not be taken from them to fund the union's ""hyper-partisan political activities,"" and urged others to ""help get unions out of politics.""

FIRST ON FOX:Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey launched parallel investigations this week into two of the nation's leading proxy advisory companies, alleging they have abdicated their fiduciary duties and violated state consumer protection laws by misleading consumers about their prioritization of ideology over investor returns.
Bailey argued in civil investigative demands sent to Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) that they are violating state consumer protection law by assuring their customers that their proxy voting recommendations are based solely on data and research – and are entirely neutral. But, simultaneously, Bailey argues that publicly available documents from the firms show that their proxy voting recommendations are designed to advance DEI and environmental causes regardless of whether they undermineinvestor returns.
Glass Lewis and ISS are two foreign-owned powerhouses that control roughly 97% of the U.S. proxy advisory market, according to an April report from the House Financial Services Committee. The firms specialize in providing voting recommendations to institutional investors – such as pension funds, retirement systems and mutual funds – on how to vote during corporate shareholder meetings. These votes frequently include decisions related to board member elections, executive compensation, company policies and other proposals.

""Missourians deserve answers as to why the unseen power brokers, controlling much of corporate America, are pushing a leftist worldview at the expense of millions of honest investors,"" Bailey said. ""These are foreign-owned actors manipulating the U.S. economy, and we will not let them thrive any longer. We are going after the source. These proxy advisors have held corporate America hostage with their radical ideologies. We are putting them on notice: Missouri will not tolerate ideological coercion disguised as investment guidance.""
In an enforcement petition Bailey sent to the state circuit court in an effort to compel the companies' compliance with the new probes, the attorney general points to statements on both ISS and Glass Lewis's websites, respectively, that insist they provide ""objective and impartial offerings"" that are ""based on research and data."" At the same time, Bailey points to internal company documents, such as a document titled ""2025 Benchmark Policy Guidelines"" from Glass Lewis, which includes numerous sections on the importance ofadvancing DEI and ESGcauses.
""This means that Glass Lewis’s statement that it provides ‘research and data’ that allows its customers to ‘make informed investment decisions’ is false,"" Bailey wrote in his enforcement petition against Glass Lewis.

Similarly, at ISS, Bailey points to company statements claiming it provides customers with ""objective and impartial offerings,"" while simultaneously producing internal company reports that include commitments to recommending votes in favor of proposals ""calling for the reduction of [greenhouse gas] emissions.""
In addition to allegedly misleading consumers about their company priorities, Bailey is accusing Glass Lewis and ISS of omitting or failing to disclose material information about how it weighs DEI and ESG standards when recommending votes.
Bailey's investigation is requesting a range of internal documents and communications to help determine whether Glass Lewis or ISS violatedstate consumer protection lawsthrough its allegedly misleading claims and lack of transparency.

""ISS and Glass Lewis have been harming consumers and misleading institutional investors by promoting a radical political agenda instead of focusing on maximizing returns. By taking legal action against both firms, Attorney General Bailey is doing the right thing and holding them accountable for selfishly prioritizing racist DEI quotas, climate activism, and other outdated ESG nonsense,"" Will Hild, Executive Director at conservative nonprofit Consumers' Research said in a statement to Fox News Digital.
""Such deception is not just financially reckless but also illegal and must be met with consequences,"" Hild continued. ""This necessary investigation will aid in exposing these activist proxy advisors for deliberately ditching fiduciary duty in the name of furthering the ESG scam.""

The Republican Congress and PresidentDonald Trumpjust delivered a major victory to the American people by passing and enacting into law the historic One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). Predictably, liberal media outlets – led by CNN, MSNBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post – continue to insist the OBBB will add trillions of dollars to our national debt.
The truth – backed by both historical experience and robust economic analysis – is the exact opposite. President Trump’s OBBB will not onlyboost jobs and take-home payfor America’s working-class families. It will slash deficits by trillions of dollars even as its targeted expenditures will strengthen our national defense and secure our borders. As a bonus, OBBB will rapidly accelerate the deportation of millions of illegal aliens now stealing jobs from American citizens and driving down wages.
At the center of the Fake News misinformation storm is the Congressional Budget Office. For years, the CBO has been trapped in a stale left-wing Keynesian mindset and stubbornly committed to static scoring models that fail to grasp how real-world economies respond to bold, pro-growth policies. As someone who has witnessed President Trump craft his economic agenda from inside the West Wing, I can tell you firsthand: when you cut taxes, slash job-killing regulations, achieve energy dominance, defend America’s manufacturing base with tariffs and fight for fair trade, the economy doesn’t just inch forward – it takes off.

Exhibit A: The Trump2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. I was there when the CBO confidently projected a return to a sleepy Obama-Biden ""new normal"" 1.8–2.0% trend growth. But what actually happened?
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' WILL UNLEASH PARALLEL PROSPERITY
In 2018, real GDP roared ahead at 2.9%. Business investment surged. Hundreds of billions in overseas profits came home. Small businesses and consumers finally felt like Washington had their backs – and they responded by spending, investing and hiring. All of this completely blindsided the bean counters at CBO, who missed the wave of innovation and confidence that Trump’s policies ignited.
Comes now CBO 2.0 – once again stumbling into the Trump policy arena with its trademark combination of backward-looking modeling and partisan blind spots. Instead of learning from its spectacular misfire on theTrump 2017 tax bill, the CBO is now recycling the same flawed assumptions to smear the fiscal integrity of President Trump’s One Big, Beautiful Bill – and the Fake News is eating it up.
Here's how the tired old misinformation act of the CBO has unfolded: At the outset of scoring the OBBB, the CBO defaulted to its static methodology. As in 2017, it assumed a chronically underwhelming annual real GDP growth rate of just1.8%–the same stale figure it has clung to for over a decade, regardless of the supply-side reforms at play. Unsurprisingly, the result of theCBO’s debut analysisof OBBB was a headline-grabbing forecast of $3.9 trillion added to the national debt over the next 10 years.
Of course, this initial forecast came under withering fire for two glaring omissions. First, as in 2017, it ignored the dynamic growth effects baked into the OBBB’s permanent tax cuts, deregulatory measures, and investment incentives. Second, it refused to account for the revenue-generating power of Trump’s tariff policy, which the White House projects will generate as much as $2.8 trillion over the same decade.

Under heavy fire, the CBO scrambled to release a second ""dynamic"" estimate – but once again, they blew it. This time, they cooked the books by frontloading the bill’s costs, artificially inflating the early debt load. That let them assume a spike in interest rates, which then conveniently wiped out the very growth their model was supposed to measure. It was a masterclass in bureaucratic sabotage disguised as fiscal analysis.
To wit: When you frontload spending – particularly on growth-oriented tax relief and business investment incentives – you should also frontload the growth surge those policies trigger. More investment, more jobs and more productivity from this dynamic growth surge translate into higher revenues and lower debt burdens, not higher. And with reduced borrowing needs, interest rates should fall – not rise – as the market prices in stronger fiscal sustainability.
Had the CBO conducted an intellectually honest dynamic analysis AND accurately accounted for the Trump tariffs, it would have forecast a massivemultitrillion-dollar surplus, NOT an equally massive increase in the debt. Instead, what we got was yet another ideological forecast designed to discredit a Trump-led growth agenda that history has already vindicated once before.

This CBO trash is what the Fake News is taking out now every day and night before the American people in its Trump Derangement Syndrome efforts to discredit what is beyond question a truly Big, Beautiful and FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE bill.
Here’s the Real News:President Trumphas designed a tax cut that will not just pay for itself through more rapid economic growth and robust tariff collections. OBBB will reduce America’s deficits by the trillions while financing everything from no taxes on tips and overtime to a much stronger national defense and far secure border. Get ready for the rocket ship.

Republican state lawmakers in Minnesota have not held back with criticism after newsGov. Tim Walzspent $430,000 in taxpayer money to prepare for a House congressional hearing probing blue state governors on their ""sanctuary city"" policies.
Invoices obtained by theStar Tribuneof Minnesota uncovered that Walz's office contracted with high-powered global law firm K&L Gates to prepare for the governor'smid-June hearingin front of the GOP-controlled House Oversight Committee, which included questions about his and other blue state governors' ""sanctuary city"" policies.
In May alone, Walz incurred legal fees of around $232,000, according to invoices the Star Tribune obtained. This balanced out to a rate of about $516 per hour, the local outlet noted.
In total, according to the Star Tribune, K&L Gates worked with Walz's office from April 10 until the June 12 hearing, costing taxpayers $430,000 for the legal preparation.

Minnesota GOP Rep. Jim Nash,one of two Republicanson the state's Legislative Advisory Commission, questioned why Walz felt compelled to get outside counsel rather than work with the state's attorneys and public relations specialists.
""A half a million dollars of taxpayer money to prepare the governor to go to his old stomping grounds seems exorbitant, particularly since the AG for thestate of Minnesotawas in Congress with Walz at the same time, and the two of them certainly could have figured out how to do what they were needing to do,"" he said.
Nash added that he intends to dig deeper into scrutinizing the invoices obtained by the Star Tribune.

Republican Minnesota state Rep. Harry Niska noted there ""appears to be no legitimate legal interest in the state racking up nearly half-a-million dollars in what amounts to PR consulting.""
""Tim Walz spent 12 years in Congress — he knows those hearing rooms inside and out, and he certainly knows how to conduct himself in that type of setting. So, why did the governor feel the need to spend $430,000 of taxpayer money on a private firm to ‘prepare’ for this hearing?"" Niska asked.
""To be clear, there appears to be no legitimate legal interest of the state in racking up nearly half a million dollars in what amounts to PR consulting as he tries to lay the groundwork for a presidential campaign that’s going absolutely nowhere. It is unconscionable to make hardworking Minnesota taxpayers pay for the governor’s personal national political aspirations.""
In response to the criticism over Walz's decision to contract with K&L Gates, both the governor and his team sidestepped offering an explanation. Instead, they suggested the blame fell at the feet of Republicans for holding a hearing that served no other purpose than to ""grandstand,"" according to the Star Tribune.

""They were too busy performing for the cameras to even feign interest in hearing from Gov. Walz about Minnesota’s balanced approach to immigration,"" Tschann added. ""What’s most frustrating is that Tom Emmer and Pete Stauber planned this spectacle knowing what it would cost and went through with it anyway.""
When asked directly about the legal bill, Walz told reporters the GOP-led hearing was ""not where I wanted to spend money. It’s not where I wanted to spend my time, and it certainly proved that there was nothing there other than using it as grandstanding.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/teachers-union-reveals-true-colors-behind-closed-doors-annual-convention,Teachers union reveals true colors behind closed doors at annual convention,"National Education Association President Becky Pringle defended illegal immigrants during a protest against immigration raids that occurred throughout the city.
The National Education Association (NEA),the nation’s largest teachers union, just held its annual convention in Portland, Oregon, and laid bare its transformation into a brazenly political organization. Far from prioritizing the education of America’s children, the NEA’s agenda was a parade of partisan resolutions, misspelled attacks on political opponents, and a clear alignment with the far-left wing of the Democratic Party.
The tone was set byAshlie Crosson, the NEA’s 2025 Teacher of the Year,who declared on July 4th that her job is ""deeply political"" and always has been. ""Once I realized how deeply political our profession had always been, I knew I could no longer stay on the sidelines,"" Crosson said. The irony of this statement on Independence Day was not lost, as the NEA proved itself anything but independent. Instead, it revealed itself as a loyal foot soldier for progressive causes, far removed from the needs of students or the concerns ofparents.
The convention’s resolutions – which were leaked to me by an NEA conference attendee – were a masterclass in political overreach. One business item called for the NEA to ""defend against Trump’s embrace of fascism by using the term facism [sic] in NEA materials to correctly characterize Donald Trump’s program and actions."" Yes, the union that claims to represent educators couldn’t even spell ""fascism"" correctly in its official resolution attacking the president. The irony is almost too rich to parody.
NATIONAL 'TEACHER OF THE YEAR' RECIPIENT FEELS JOB IS 'DEEPLY POLITICAL'
The NEA didn’t stop there. Another resolution labeled any move toeliminate the U.S. Department of Educationas an ""illegal, anti-democratic, and racist attempt to destroy public education and privatize it in the interests of the billionaires."" Calling the abolition of a federal bureaucracy ""racist"" is absurd, especially when theDepartment of Education’strack record has failed low-income minority students for decades. If anything, the department’s one-size-fits-all approach has entrenched disparities, trapping kids in failing schools based on their ZIP codes.
The NEA openly supports leftist politics and its latest convention was just more proof. FILE: President Becky Pringle speaks at the Philadelphia delegation on July 4, 2024.(YouTube/screenshot)
Immigration policy, another topic far afield from teaching math or reading, also took center stage. The NEA adopted a resolution to ""defend birthright citizenship and oppose the attempt to revert to pre-civil rights movement – Jim Crow – legal concepts of ‘states rights’ in order to deny citizenship to the children of immigrants."" The union went further, supporting students’ ""right to dissent and organize against Trump’s policies"" and ""against ICE raids and deportations.""
The NEA’s resolutions also took aim at parental rights. In response to theSupreme Court’s Mahmoud v. Taylor ruling,which allows parents to opt their children out of gender ideology instruction, the NEA adopted a business item signaling its intent to keep pushing such content in classrooms. This defiance of parental choice shows a union more interested in indoctrination than education. Similarly, the NEA passed a resolution supporting ""the mass democratic movement against Trump’s authoritarianism and violations of human rights,"" further cementing its role as a political activist group rather than an advocate for teachers or students.
DEMOCRATS SHOULD 'BREAK UP' WITH RANDI WEINGARTEN, EX-HARRIS CAMPAIGN AIDE ARGUES
Perhaps most puzzling was the NEA’s decision to ""not use, endorse, or publicize any materials from theAnti-Defamation League (ADL),""an organization founded to combat antisemitism. Why single out a group dedicated to fighting hate? This move raises serious questions about the union’s priorities and sends a troubling message at a time when antisemitism is on the rise.
The NEA’s political bias is not new. Nearly all its political contributions go to Democrats every election cycle, making it less a union and more a money-laundering operation for the Democratic Party. With over $380 million in annual revenue, the NEA has plenty of resources to push its agenda. This one-sided partisanship is particularly galling given the NEA’s unique status as the only union in the nation with a federal charter, granted over a century ago. This special privilege, bestowed by Congress, is no longer justified for an organization so blatantly partisan. Lawmakers should revoke this charter immediately.
The NEA’s priorities are so misaligned that in 2019, it rejected a resolution to ""rededicate itself to the pursuit of increased student learning in every public school in America."" Let that sink in: a teachers union explicitly refused to prioritize student learning. Instead, it has quadrupled down on its war on education, turning classrooms into activist training grounds.

The NEA’s actions echo the words of Horace Mann, the father of public education, who said, ""We who are engaged in the sacred cause of education are entitled to look upon all parents as having given hostages to our cause."" The NEA seems to agree, treating children as tools for its political projects rather than individuals deserving a quality education.
TEACHERS UNION BOSSES SPLIT OVER SUPREME COURT RULING ON PARENTAL RIGHTS TO SHIELD KIDS FROM LGBTQ CONTENT
The consequences of this politicization are clear. Only about a quarter of American eighth graders are proficient in math, and reading scores are similarly dismal. Yet the NEA remains focused on partisan crusades rather than addressing these failures.
The union went further, supporting students’ ""right to dissent and organize against Trump’s policies"" and ""against ICE raids and deportations.""
This radical agenda is free advertising for school choice and homeschooling. Parents are rightly alarmed by a union that sees their children as ""hostages"" to its cause. Since 2019, there has been amass exodus from union-controlled public schools,over a million families opting for charter schools, private schools or homeschooling. The NEA’sPortlandconvention only accelerates this trend, as parents seek educational options that prioritize learning over politics.

Teachers deserve a union that fights for their professional interests, not one that uses their dues to fund partisan agendas. Parents deserve schools that focus on reading, writing, and arithmetic, not activism. And students deserve an education that prepares them for life, not one that conscripts them into ideological battles.
Until the NEA returns to its core mission, it will continue to lose members, credibility and public trust. Lawmakers should start by voting to revoke its federal charter, and parents should keep voting with their feet.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/socialist-nyc-mayoral-candidate-mamdani-once-called-seize-luxury-homes-house-homeless-during-covid,Socialist NYC mayoral candidate Mamdani once called to ‘seize’ luxury homes to house homeless during COVID,"'Outnumbered' co-hosts analyze New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's communal living proposal as President Donald Trump responds to his to policies.
Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic Party's candidate forNew York Citymayor and a self-proclaimed socialist, is once again garnering backlash for previous comments he has made espousing language steeped in radical socialist and communist ideology.
Mamdani, this time, is getting blasted for calling on the government to ""seize"" luxury condos to house the homeless during the coronavirus pandemic.
The unearthed remarks, stemming from a March 2020 social media post, followed news of separate rediscovered remarks from Mamdami touting the need to ""de-commodify"" housing through replacing luxury condos with communal-style living that would include things like shared laundry facilities and food co-ops.
""The oligarchs who want us to return to work to goose the stock market are the same ones with thousands of luxury condos as investment properties, sitting empty while NYers die on the streets & in shelters,"" Mamdani wrote on social media in response to a news report claiming the first homeless person in New York City with the coronavirus had passed away amid the pandemic.

""Seize these properties,"" Mamdani demanded in his post, written while campaigning for the New York State Assembly. ""House the homeless. Enact a #HomesGuarantee.""

In part, during the video, Mamdani called for establishing ""community land trusts to gradually buy up housing on the private market and convert it to community ownership."" In more simplistic terms, Mamdami explained his housing idea would essentially aim to replace luxury condos with communal-style living that would include things like shared laundry, kitchens, food co-ops, bathhouses, pharmacies, lecture halls, swimming pools and more.
""If we want to end the housing crisis, the solution has to be moving toward the full de-commodification of housing,"" Mamdani says. ""In other words, moving away from the status quo in which most people access housing by purchasing it on the market and toward a future where we guarantee high quality housing to all as a human right.""

Other comments rooted in radical socialist and communist ideology from Mamdani have surfaced in recent weeks as well.
Critics have also pointed to comments that Mamdani made at a Young Democratic Socialists of America conference in 2021, during which the then-State Assembly membertold attendeesnot to compromise on goals like ""seizing the means of production.""
Meanwhile, current New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who left the Democratic Party to run as an Independent,slammed Mamdami this weekfor explicitly quoting communist revolutionary thinker Karl Marx.
MAMDANI CAMP SILENT WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CALLS TO ‘RADICALIZE’ HIGH SCHOOLERS, ‘DISMANTLE’ US
The post Adams shared included nothing more than the following simple message shared by Mamdani: ""Each according to their need, each according to their ability.""
To the less politically-inclined social media user, the message might seem innocuous, but, in reality, it is a direct quote from Karl Marx, a revolutionary socialist who penned the infamous ""Communist Manifesto"" with fellow socialist political philosopher Friedrich Engels during the late 19th-century.
President Donald Trump has referred to Mamdani as a ""100% Communist Lunatic"" and vowed to ""save New York City"" from Mamdani if he gets elected, suggesting awillingness to withhold federal fundsfrom the city if Mamdani doesn't ""behave.""
However, Mamdani has rejected claims he is a ""communist."" In response toTrump's criticism of being a ""communist,""Mamdani directly refuted the claim during an interview with NBC News.

""No, I am not,"" Mamdani responded when asked point-blank by NBC's Kristen Welker. ""I have already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I'm from, who I am, ultimately, because he wants to distract from what I'm fighting for. And I'm fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower that he has since then betrayed.
""When we talk about my politics, you know, I call myself a Democratic socialist — in many ways, inspired by the words of Dr. [Martin Luther] King from decades ago, who said, ‘Call it democracy, call it Democratic-Socialism, there has to be a better distribution of wealth for all of God’s children in this country.""

""That's it!"" the girl exclaimed. ""That's what happened! That's what my family’s big secret was!""
In Economics class, my seniors were learning about the 2008financial crisisand the Great Recession. We watched clips from the movie ""The Big Short"" illustrating how banks used teaser rates to lure people into buying homes lenders knew they probably couldn't afford. Surprised by my student’s reaction, I asked her to tell us her story.
""When I was little, my parents bought a house. It had a yard, and I even had my own room. It was wonderful, but even then, I sensed something wasn't right. My immigrant parents didn't earn much money. They had never gone to college — my mom was a waitress, my dad was a cook.

RED STATE OFFICIAL RECOUNTS PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF BEING 'DEBANKED' AND WHY IT 'HAS TO BE STOPPED'
Like millions of Americans, when her parents were offered the chance to buy a home, they leaped at it. Banks were making suspect loans and putting them into mortgage bonds. The rating agencies gave the bonds good ratings, and banks sold them to unsuspecting investors.
Her parents’ teaser rate expired a couple years later, and their monthly payment skyrocketed. They couldn’t afford the new payment and home prices had dropped, so they were upside down. They couldn't pay, they couldn't sell, so they walked away under threat of foreclosure.
My students were amazed and kept asking how the government could’ve allowed banks to do this.
Today, this is a very relevant question. In reaction to these widespread Wall Street abuses, theConsumer Financial Protection Bureauwas created in 2010 with the passage of theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.The CFPB has oversight authority over banks, mortgage companies, payday lenders and private education lenders. Its first director, Richard Cordray, said the CFPB emphasizes mortgages, credit cards and student loans.

Trump has called the CFPB’s staff a ""vicious group"" that is ""woke"" and ""weaponized"" and under the new budget the CFPB will lose almost half its funding. It has also been targeted by the Department of Government Efficiency.
The CFPB claims it has provided consumers almost $20 billion in relief via monetary compensation, principal reductions on loans, and canceled debts. It has also assessed $5 billion in civil penalties.

At times, companies back down and resolve problems out of fear of CFPB action. No more — theTrump administration has cut backthe CFPB’s enforcement actions.

The administration dismissed 22 enforcement cases against major banks and others — involving over $3 billion in alleged harm toconsumers —that were pending in January.

As I teach my economics students some of the basics of consumer finance, they are somewhat bewildered. Their confusion demonstrates the CFPB’s value.
The CFPB claims it has provided consumers almost $20 billion in relief via monetary compensation, principal reductions on loans, and canceled debts. It has also assessed $5 billion in civil penalties.
For example, the CFPB enforces the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which mandatescredit card companiesdivulge to cardholders the ramifications of only making the minimum monthly payment. I show a credit card bill which has a $10,000 balance — they’re surprised that, as the box in the corner of the bill indicates, it will take 23 years and almost double the current balance to pay it off.

For young people, junk fees hit hard — I get letters from former students shocked at how much they are charged, and at a time when they are financially vulnerable. Last year, the CFPB moved to close loopholes on overdraft fees and credit card late fees, and cap them at $5 and $8 respectively. The Trump administration is eliminating both caps.
Between young people and the financial institutions they inevitably interact with, there exists a huge power imbalance. Young people need a vibrant, effective CFPB to help level it.

Donald Trumphas just had the best few weeks of his presidency.
No question. No argument. Period, end of paragraph.
It began with a bold gamble to send pilots to destroy Iran's nuclear sites.
Then Trump managed to broker a cease-fire between Israel and Iran.
TRUMP’S ACHIEVEMENTS EMBOLDEN HIM TO BE EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE
Meanwhile, as Trump delayed his sky-high tariffs, the stock market hit record highs.
And he won a $16-million settlement from CBS's parent company in his lawsuit against unfair editing by ""60 Minutes."" That means he has now beaten two of the three broadcast networks, having won the same sum from ABC in a suit involving a crucial mistake by George Stephanopoulos.
And after days of pressure and arm-twisting, he managed to pass the Big Beautiful Bill.
President Trump's been on a serious winning streak these past few weeks – culminating in the passage of his ""big, beautiful bill.""(Samuel Corum/Getty Images)
Make no mistake, the bill was always going to pass. What were Republicans going to say, never mind, we just tanked the president's main legislative priority because we didn't like this or that?
They didn't need Democratic votes, under so-called reconciliation. And Trump controls the GOP. So its members fell into line.
Now the question is why, through this successful stretch, has Trump continued to draw such negative coverage?
TRUMP SIGNS 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL' BILL IN SWEEPING VICTORY FOR SECOND TERM AGENDA, OVERCOMING DEMS AND GOP REBELS
For starters, many in the media just can’t stand the guy. And this has largely been true since 2015. So anything that helps him must be wrong and must be denigrated.
Even the successful strikeon Irandrew only scattered instances of grudging praise, when under any other president there would have been standing ovations.
The press immediately reframed this as a debate over whether the bunker-busting bombs had only set back Iran’s nuclear program by a few months.
The press' scant praise over Trump's Iran strikes quickly devolved into debate over how far they really set back Tehran's nuclear program.(Planet Labs PBC via AP)
In fairness, that’s what the preliminary, classified Intel report leaked to the press said. And there’s nothing wrong with reporting that accurately, even though the assessment was made with low confidence.
But Trump wants reporters for CNN and the New York Times, which broke the story, fired over this, and with anFBI leak probeunder way, says he may force journalists to reveal their confidential sources.
Once the White House could no longer blame anonymous sources, there is nothing wrong with quoting a government report – even if if turns out to be wrong.
The cease-fire between Israel and Iran was fine, but that quickly morphed into chatter about why Trump couldn’t pull off an end to the fighting between Israel and Hamas, a far more difficult task.
AFTER SETBACK TO IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM, TRUMP EXPECTED TO LEVERAGE MILITARY SUPPORT IN NETANYAHU MEETING
Not to mention his freezing of weapons shipments to Ukraine, when despite his ""very disappointing"" call withVladimir Putin, who promptly unleashed the biggest drone and missile attack against Kyiv since the illegal invasion of its sovereign neighbor.
Perhaps the president is learning what has been obvious to the rest of us: Putin has no conceivable interest in peace.
Everyone had to report the stock market surge, though not with the enthusiasm of the earlier plunge, and Trump yesterday announced that he’d hit Japan and South Korea, two allies, with a 25 percent hike in tariffs. But they don’t take effect till Aug. 1, so this could just be another negotiating tactic.
There was also next to zero coverage of Trump's $16 million settlement with Paramount.(Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
There was almost no television coverage of Trump’s $16 million settlement with Paramount, which is nothing more than the news business protecting its own. If this had been any other kind of company – with the backstory that someone like Shari Redstone needed administration approval to sell the company and pocket $2 billion – the press would have gone haywire.
Now there’s a new twist. Fox’s Charlie Gasparino,writing for the New York Post, reported the Paramount settlement includes a side deal between Trump and for the buyer David Ellison, son of tech mogul Larry Ellison, for him to run $15 to $20 million in advertising supporting causes backed by the president.
And Trump confirmed it.
""We did a deal for about $16 million plus $16 million, or maybe more than that in advertising,"" he told reporters.
Paramount denied any knowledge of the side deal.

The president has also been drawn into a war of words withElon Musk, calling him a ""train wreck"" who’s gone ""off the rails"" in forming a third party and raising the Epstein files again. Musk says the lack of an Epstein client list is the ""final straw"" – he had once apologized for raising it – and there’s no difference between the Republican and Democratic parties.
But there was one moment, in my view, that was a misstep by Trump.
The president had no need to negotiate with Democrats, who strongly opposed a tax cut tilted toward the wealthy while making deep cuts to Medicaid.
""Every Democrat in Congress voted against the ‘Big, Beautiful Bill…They wouldn’t vote only because they hate Trump, but I hate them, too, you know? I really do. I hate them. I cannot stand them, because I really believe they hate our country.""

What I did not know at that time was that, 15 years later, my family and I would flee Venezuela after I was accused of terrorism and obtained political asylum underthe first Trump administration.
That same year, I visited New York — the city that I saw multiple times in movies. I was impressed. The skyscrapers, the infrastructure, walking through Times Square and seeing the number of brands... It was the symbol of individual progress. Today, that incredible city is flirting with the same ideas of the country that forced me to escape.
Freezing rent prices? Building more public housing? Converting private properties into communes? I’ve heard those ideas before. President Hugo Chávez did the same in Venezuela with his ""Gran Misión Vivienda Venezuela"" program: he promised to end market abuses, offered free housing and began to nationalize private properties. The result? Collapsed investment,poorly built homes,widespread corruption and millions living in terrible conditions.
REP. CROCKETT CLAIMS AMERICANS CAN'T AFFORD A HOME OR GROCERIES DUE TO TRUMP'S IMMIGRATION POLICIES
Free public transportation? I saw it.  In Venezuela, Chávez did it: he declared transportation a ""right"" and fully subsidized it. The prices were so ""low"" that they didn’t even cover basic operating costs.

What happened? The system collapsed. Without maintenance, the buses stopped circulating. Today, millions of people spend hours in line to get on one bus, if it arrives.
Government grocery stores?In Venezuela, it was called Mercal: a state network that soon became synonymous with long lines, expired food, scarcity and smuggling handled by the regime. Only those loyal to the party ate.

And the idea that billionaires shouldn’t exist? Chávez said the same thing. He expropriated those who generated employment and progress, and, in the end, the only rich individuals were the politicians.
I could continue listing each socialist promise made, and the result remains the same:Socialism always fails.It doesn’t matter the country or who applies it. It brings scarcity, repression and ruin. But it’s not just a practical mistake. It is a perverse ideology that attacks freedom, property and human dignity.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/threats-to-u-s-energy-projects-threat-to-national-security,Green energy zealots hand America's enemies the ultimate weapon,"Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking in New Hampshire, tells Fox News Digital that without American leadership the world is 'a lot less safe'
When radical environmental groups denounce the United States’ use offossil fuels, they often romanticize countries attempting to wean themselves from coal, oil and natural gas as models for us to follow.
But the reality is that these resources remain vital to America’s national and economic security, and the only ones more eager than green groups to end our country’s energy development are geopolitical rivals like Russia and China.
For a world power like the United States, policies that restrict the production and use of our God-given natural resources would hand a strategic andeconomic advantageto authoritarian regimes. Unfortunately, environmental zealots don’t seem to understand this inherent problem with their agenda. Or worse, they simply don’t care.

Take, for example, Greenpeace, which was recently ordered to pay $667 million to the developer of the Dakota Access Pipeline following its campaign of deception and destruction.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PURSUING ENERGY DOMINANCE — CONGRESS SHOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY
What Greenpeace and other extremist groups don’t grasp is that their efforts to stop oil and natural gas development would weaken the United States, embolden rogue nations, hurt our economy and have very little, if any, impact on the environment.
Making the United States moredependent on renewable energywould make the U.S. electricity grid less reliable and threaten the nation’s economy. Spain is a pertinent example.
In April, the country bragged that for the first time, it was running on 100% renewable energy. Later that month, a grid failure created a nationwide blackout that risked lives and cost the country nearly a half-billion dollars.
Generating electricity solely through renewables makes electric grids more prone to collapse, and requires incredibly expensive upgrades to energy infrastructure that leads to higher electricity prices for consumers.
THE PREDICTABLE OUTCOME OF CALIFORNIA’S GREEN ENERGY POLICIES HAS ARRIVED AND IT'S A DISASTER
The International Energy Agency found that for every 10% increase in the portion of electricity generated by renewables, costs go up by more than 4 cents per kilowatt hour. As a result, countries like Germany pay more than 2.5 times the average electricity rate than the United States, and over four times higher than China.
When countries likeChina or Russiacan generate electricity more cheaply than their democratic rivals, they gain an important economic advantage. China’s coal consumption reached record highs last year, and its buildout of new coal power plants reached the highest level of construction in the last 10 years. Russia is the world’s second-largest exporter of natural gas and holds natural gas reserves that rival the U.S.
When it comes to the environment, these countries are not extracting or using fossil fuels with the same care as American companies. In fact, the largest carbon emitter in the world by a long shot is China. In 2020, China’s emissions exceeded those of all other developed nations combined. As China andRussiacontinue to develop their fossil fuel resources, it will be essential that the United States do the same.

Groups like Greenpeace may continue their efforts to derail American fossil fuel projects, but policymakers should recognize that this agenda would have little impact on the environment and a lasting and damaging impact on both U.S. national security and economic competitiveness.
To protect the environment and preserve our democratic values, the United States must pursue an energy policy rooted in realism, not ideology. While environmental activism has a place in shaping a sustainable future, radical efforts to dismantle fossil fuel development ignore a critical truth – energy security isnational security.
Abandoning domestic oil and gas production would not reduce global emissions, it would only hand a strategic advantage to those who pollute more, care less and gain power when democracies self-sabotage.

Groups like Greenpeace may cloak themselves in the language of environmental justice, but their actions serve to undermine the very stability and environmental stewardship they claim to champion.
America must remain energy-independent, competitive and strong because the world’s most polluting regimes won’t sacrifice theirenergy dominanceno matter what we decide to do.

House SpeakerMike Johnson,R-La., said Sunday that President Donald Trump's megabill will be ""jet fuel"" for the economy despite Democrats' criticisms.
Johnson, who ceremoniously handed Trump the gavel after the president signed his signature tax cuts and spending package into law Friday, teased two future bills to be passed within the next year. In an appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" he said the ""big, beautiful bill,"" which is ""a huge leap forward for our priorities,"" is the first step in a three-tier strategy. Johnson expects a second reconciliation bill by fall and a third by spring before the end of the current Congress.
""I think we can do that, and so you'll see more of us advancing these common-sense principles to deliver that American First agenda for the people,"" Johnson said. ""That's what they elected us to do, and this was hugely forward.""
Johnson pushed back on a reported Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) memo claiming Republicans will lose the majority in 2026 as a result of the ""big, beautiful bill.""

""Our Republicans are going to be out across the country telling the simple truth, and guess what? It will be demonstrated,"" Johnson said. ""Everyone will have more take-home pay, they'll have more jobs and opportunity. The economy will be doing better, and we'll be able to point to that as the obvious result of what we did. So don't buy into those false talking points.""
The speaker dismissed criticisms fromRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif.,and DNC Chair Ken Martin in particular as ""old, tired talking points"" that are typically used against any Republican tax legislation.
Johnson stressed that the bill permanently extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts, which the speaker claims targeted lower- and middle-income Americans. He said the bottom 20% of earners witnessed their lowest federal tax rates in 40 years because of those original cuts and said that the new megabill expands on that by cutting taxes on tips, overtime pay, and seniors – benefits that he says will help Republicans during the 2026 midterm elections.
""We're giving everybody a tax cut,"" Johnson told ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream. ""And that's going to help the economy, it's going be jet fuel. Small business owners, entrepreneurs, risk-takers, the people that provide the jobs, manufacturers, farmers get assistance here, and that will lift the economy.""
Citing the Council of Joint Economic Advisers, Johnson said the megabill will spur 3% economic growth, create 4 million jobs and increase the average household's take-home pay by $13,000.
""This is a great thing for people who go to work every day,"" Johnson said. ""They're going to feel that. And we're excited about the upcoming election cycle in '26. Because people will be riding an economic high, just as we did after the first two years of the first Trump administration. This time it's on steroids.""

Johnson also responded to criticism fromRep. Glenn Ivey, D-Md.,who argued that the megabill makes tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans permanent, while those for the working class ""are time sensitive"" and ""expire in a couple of years.""
""Now, I don't think he read the bill, it's 940 pages, so I would give some grace on that,"" Johnson said in response to Ivey's claims.
Bream noted that Ivey was listening while the bill text was read on the Senate floor last Sunday.

""Yeah, you're right, for 19 hours or whatever it took,"" Johnson said. ""If you make between $30,000 and $80,000 a year, you can have a 15% less federal tax rate. You're going to save more money, you're going to keep more of your hard-earned money, and that's not going away. So by making all these tax cuts permanent, it's the largest tax bill, the most important, most consequential tax bill that Congress has ever passed because of what it does for people who go out and work hard every day.""
Johnson said the bill pushes ""pro-growth policies"" and constitutes the ""largest savings for the taxpayers in U.S. history.""

""In the bill, we're also going to secure the border permanently. We're going to return to American energy dominance again, which is going to also be jet fuel to the economy,"" Johnson said.

""Since then, no morestolen lunches,"" he wrote in his post.
""I said I was tired of my food being stolen.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/president-trumps-big-beautiful-bill-unleash-parallel-prosperity,"SCOTT BESSENT: President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill' will unleash parallel prosperity","President Donald Trump opens up about the future of the country following the passage of the 'big, beautiful bill.'
The same issues that drove the Founders to declare independence from the Crown in 1776 drove 77 million Americans to the polls in 2024: heavy taxes, weak leadership, and an overreaching government numb to the needs of its citizens. President Trump won in a landslide victory by offering powerful solutions to each of these problems. He is the American people's declaration of independence from business as usual in Washington.
The president seeks to serve ""the forgotten men and women of America."" And theOne Big, Beautiful Bill, which he signs into law today, is central to that mission. This historic legislation will make life more affordable for all Americans by unleashing parallel prosperity—the idea that Main Street and Wall Street can grow together.
NEW PROJECTION SIGNALS GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, WORKERS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'
The One Big, Beautiful Bill represents the priorities of the new Republican Party, which includes millions of working-class Americans who once called themselves Democrats. This bill builds on the blue-collar renaissance started by President Trump.
Since President Trump took office in January, blue-collar wages have increased 1.7%. This represents the largest increase in working-class wages to start a presidency in more than 50 years. For comparison, working-class wages decreased during the same period under every single president since Richard Nixon with only one exception—President Trump in his first term.

Key to sparking the president’s second blue-collar boom has been his efforts to end illegal immigration. The open-border policy of previous administrations accelerated our nation’s affordability crisis. The influx of millions of illegal aliens put an unsustainable strain on healthcare, housing, education and welfare. It also supported a black market in labor that artificially suppressed working-class wages for decades. But that ends with the One Big Beautiful Bill.
The One Big Beautiful Bill is more than just a tax bill. It works to ensure that illegal immigrants are not taking advantage of the safety net created for Americans. The bill also funds the completion of the border wall and provides resources to hire thousands of additional federal agents to protect our country against future illegal immigration. The goal is to redirect the estimated $249 billion inannualwagespaid to illegal workers to lawful workers and American citizens. Ending the black market of undocumented labor by funding enforcement of our existing immigration laws will result in a massive pay raise for the working class.

We have seen American workers benefit from the president’s economic approach before. Under President Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, the net worth of the bottom 50% of households increased faster than the net worth of the top 10% of households. That will happen again under the One Big Beautiful Bill.
The billprevents a $4.5 trillion tax hikeon the American people. This will allow the average worker to keep an additional $4,000 to $7,200 in annual real wages and allow the average family of four to keep an additional $7,600 to $10,900 in take-home pay. Add to this the president’s ambitious deregulation agenda, whichcouldsave the average family of four an additional $10,000. For millions of Americans, these savings are the difference between being able to make a mortgage payment, buy a car, or send a child to college.
The president is delivering on his promise to seniors as well. The bill provides an additional $6,000 deduction for seniors,which will meanthat 88% of seniors receiving Social Security income will pay no tax on their Social Security benefits.
The One Big Beautiful Bill also codifies no tax on tips and no tax on overtime pay—both policies designed to provide financial relief to America’s working class. These tax breaks will ensure Main Street workers keep more of their hard-earned income. And they will bolster productivity by rewarding Americans who work extra hours. All Americans can learn how President Trump’s tax cuts will impact their lives for the better witha new White House calculator.
These productivity-enhancing measures dovetail with the second booster in the blue-collar boom: providing 100% expensing for new factories and existing factories that expand operations, plus car loan interest deductibility to support Made-in-America.
Economic security is national security. This became especially clear during COVID, which exposed glaring vulnerabilities in our critical supply chains. By providing 100% expensing for factories—in addition to rebalancing trade to encourage greater domestic production—President Trump is fortifying our supply chains and reawakening the might of America’s industrial base.
To help fuel this effort, the president is unleashing American energy by removing onerous regulations, increasing oil and gas lease sales, eliminating the perverse subsidies of the Green New Scam, and refilling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. These measures will make life more affordable for American families by bringing down the costs of gas and electricity across the country.

Through the One Big Beautiful Bill, President Trump is taking a bottom-up approach to restoring the economy. To that end, the bill makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent to give businesses of all sizes the certainty they need to grow, hire, and plan for the long term. It also provides targeted relief for small businesses by more than doubling the cap on overall small business expensing. These tax provisions will put billions of dollars back in the hands of America’s small business owners, which they can then use to expand their workforce and reinvigorate Main Street.
The intent of all these policies—be it tax cuts for the working class, full expensing for manufacturers, or new deductions for small businesses—is the same: to improve the lives of Americans on every rung of the economic ladder. With visionary leadership, President Trump is laying the foundation for the Golden Age he promised through tax deals, trade deals, peace deals, and deregulation.

The One Big Beautiful Bill will Make America Affordable Again. It will cement the blue-collar boom, reignite U.S. manufacturing, and unleash the commercial potential of the greatest economy in the world. Today marks the passage of the largest tax cut in history for our nation’s workers. It is a tribute to the Founders who demanded lower taxes themselves and is the perfect way to begin America’s 250th anniversary celebration.

In addition to base and overtime pay, the dollar amount also includes ""other"" pay, leave time payouts, health insurance payments, pension contributions, deferred contributions, long-term disability and life insurance payouts.
The highest paid lifeguard OpenTheBooks found brought in $523,351 in base pay, ""other pay,"" and benefits in 2024.

L.A. County's lifeguard division is recognized as one of the largest professional lifeguard services in the country. According to OpenTheBooks, in addition to higher-paid lifeguards, whose duties can range from watching swimmers to major maritime rescues and emergency response, there are a slew of lower-paid lifeguards that bring the total number of them in the Los Angeles-area to around 1,500.
OpenTheBooks, which tracks wasteful spending across the government, reported in 2021 that the top-paid lifeguards in Los Angeles County earned up to $510,283 – nearly half of which was overtime pay. That year, 98 lifeguards in L.A. County made at least $200,000.
In 2024, overtime pay played a major role in boosting lifeguard earnings in Los Angeles.

Beyond Los Angeles, excessive overtime pay has sparked debate in other cities — particularly those grappling with major budget shortfalls.
In Seattle,police officershave had to be disciplined for repeatedly violating the city's overtime policy. PerThe Seattle Times, a patrol officer made more than the mayor, the police chief or any other city employee in 2019 after raking in more than $414,000.
Overtime abuse has been an issue in other major cities like New York and Chicago, as well. In Chicago, where the city faces a growing budget shortfall, records obtained by a local news outlet found that during the first six months of 2024, the city had already spent 30% more than was allocated for police overtime pay. In New York, a former department chief for the NYPD is currently under investigation for alleged overtime abuse and other crimes.

Republicans' ""big beautiful bill"" is purported to help overtime workers bring home even more, with its ""no tax on tips"" provision. Initially, the House's version of the bill had no limit on how much overtime pay could be exempt, but the Senate's version of the bill capped it at $12,500.

POLITICAL FIGHT OVER ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’ SHIFTS TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL

The president is scheduled to sign the massive spending and tax cut bill into law Friday at 5pm, at a White House signing ceremony.
With the legislative battle over the bill finished, and Trump andcongressional Republican leadersvictorious, the campaign trail war now begins over the controversial measure, which many of the most recent public opinion polls suggest is not very popular with Americans.
'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL ON WAY TO WHITE HOUSE AFTER NARROWLY PASSING FINAL HURDLE IN CONGRESS
""Every Democrat voted to hurt working families and to protect the status quo,"" argued a memo from the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) released minutes after the final House passage of the bill.
And the NRCC, which is the campaign arm of the House GOP, emphasized that ""House Republicans will be relentless in making this vote the defining issue of 2026.""
House Republicans will be defending their razor-thin majority in the chamber (220-215 when the House is at full strength) when all 435 seats are up for grabs in next year's midterm elections.

NRCC chair Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina, in an opinion piece published on Friday morning, charged that House Democrats ""rejected common sense"" by voting against the bill.
""And we will make sure each one of them has to answer for it,"" he vowed, as he pointed to next year's congressional elections.
The bill is stuffed full of Trump's 2024 campaign trail promises and second-term priorities on tax cuts, immigration, defense, energy and the debt limit.
It includes extending his signature 2017 tax cuts and eliminating taxes on tips and overtime pay.
By making his first-termtax ratespermanent - they were set to expire later this year - the bill will cut taxes by nearly $4.4 trillion over the next decade, according to analysis by the Congressional Budget Office and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN TRUMP'S ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’
The measure also provides billions for border security and codifies the president's controversial immigration crackdown.
And the bill also restructures Medicaid — the nearly 60-year-old federal program that provides health coverage to roughly 71 million low-income Americans. Additionally, Senate Republicans increased cuts to Medicaid over what the House initially passed in late May.
The changes toMedicaid, as well as cuts to food stamps, another one of the nation's major safety net programs, were drafted in part as an offset to pay for extending Trump's tax cuts. The measure includes a slew of new rules and regulations, including work requirements for many of those seeking Medicaid coverage.
And the $3.4 trillion legislative package is also projected to surge the national debt by $4 trillion over the next decade.
Democrats for a couple of months have blasted Republicans over the social safety net changes.
""BREAKING: House Republicans vote to kick 17 million people off health care,"" screamed the headline in an email from the Democratic National Committee to supporters, moments after the bill passed the House on Thursday.
House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries charged that ""extreme House Republicans just approved the largest cut to Medicaid and food assistance in American history to fund tax breaks for their billionaire donors.""
And Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) chair Rep. Suzan DelBene pledged that ""the DCCC will make sure every battleground voter knows how vulnerable House Republicans abandoned them by passing the most unpopular piece of legislation in modern American history, and we’re going to take back the House majority because of it.""
Expect to see ads from Democrats as early as this holiday weekend taking aim at Republicans over their passage of the bill. And the Democrats are expected to turn up the volume on the messaging campaign next month, during the August congressional break.
HOW MUCH THE ‘BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL’ WILL CUT YOUR TAXES
But Republicans are also going on offense, targeting Democrats for voting against tax cuts.
Republicans are shining a spotlight on a poll conducted by a GOP-aligned public policy group that indicates strong support for the bill due to the tax cut provisions.
A release earlier this week from the group, One Nation, argued that ""polling shows that the public supports the Republican plan to cut taxes for families, eliminate taxes on Social Security, overtime, and tips, and reign in waste and abuse in the federal budget.""

The president, as he returned to the nation's capital early Friday after his event in Iowa, touted his bill.
""I think it's very popular. It does many things, but one of them is the biggest tax cuts in our country's history. And that alone makes it very popular,"" Trump said.
But Democrats spotlighted a slew of national polls conducted last month that indicate the bill's popularity in negative territory.
By a 21-point margin, voters questioned in the most recentFox News national pollopposed the bill (38% favored vs. 59% opposed).

The bill was also underwater in other national surveys conducted last month by the Washington Post (minus 19 points), Pew Research (minus 20 points) and Quinnipiac University (minus 26 points).
About half of respondents questioned in the Fox News poll said the bill would hurt their family (49%), while one quarter thought it would help (23%), and another quarter didn't think it would make a difference (26%).

The latest surveys all indicated a wide partisan divide over the measure.
According to the Fox News poll, which was conducted June 13-16, nearly three-quarters of Republicans (73%) favored the bill, while nearly nine in ten Democrats (89%) and nearly three-quarters of independents (73%) opposed the measure.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/hardware-stores-nuts-bolts-american-freedom-july-4th,Hardware stores are the nuts and bolts of American freedom this July 4th,"‘The Five’ co-hosts discuss New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani’s platform.
In 1997, in the early, optimistic, post-Soviet days, I visited Odesa, Ukraine, to lead discussions about democratic governance systems for the region’s public officials. That beautiful, historic city on the Black Sea, once a polyglot center of commerce — now horrifically targeted by Russian bombs — was just awakening from socialism.
Private hotels and restaurants had opened, even as Soviet-era ""sanitoria"" — government-owned resorts for labor unions — continued to operate. But the green shoots of private ownership had not yet reached its housing market — such as its long blocks of ""Khruschevka"" concrete slab, three-to-five-story, 1950s-era apartment blocks, named for the former Soviet premier who once promised to ""bury"" the U.S. Publichousingwas the rule, not the exception, under socialism.
That helped explain the absence of a type of business I noticed was missing on the streets of the city made famous by Sergei Eisenstein’s film, ""SS Potemkin:"" pe They are ubiquitous in the U.S., of course, from the Home Depot and Lowe’s giants to the hundreds of small-town ""True Value"" affiliates. Their absence during the hangover from the socialism period led me to realize that the outlets for everything from lumber to wall plaster to bathroom grout hold a significance that goes beyond their thousands of inventory items. They say much about America — from private homeownership to personal agency and required responsibility that go along with it. In other words, freedom.
SOCIALIST MAYORAL CANDIDATE ZOHRAN MAMDANI UNDER FIRE FOR PLAN TO TAX 'RICHER AND WHITER NEIGHBORHOODS'
In contrast to the dreams of city planners during the Depression, public housing — a la Moscow, literally, to which early government housing advocates looked as a model — never took root in the U.S. Instead,homeownership increasedfrom 44% in 1930 to 65% today. We tend to think of ownership in terms of the extent to which it’s affordable — but not to pay enough attention to what it implies about the American way of life — and, yes, the freedom we celebrate on July 4.

That’s wherehardware storescome in. Homeowners must rely, first and foremost, on themselves to maintain their properties, their key source of personal wealth. Yes, we can now call on Angie’s List to find contractors and handy-persons — but it’s our responsibility to notice the leaks that can destroy a ceiling, to take care that pipes don’t freeze during a cold snap, to make sure gutters and downspouts are clear so roofs and clapboard siding don’t rot. We can’t call the property’s landlord — we are that person.

The stakes are high.Pew Research reportsthat among ""households that own their primary residence – home equity accounted for a median of 45% of their net worth in 2021."" In other words, almost half our personal wealth is tied up in a home we own. Surprisingly, it matters the most to some minority households. Per Pew, ""Home equity is especially important for Black and Hispanic homeowners. In 2021, they derived 63% and 66% of their net worth from home equity, respectively, at the median.""
ERIC ADAMS BACKS 50 CENT, SAYS DEM SOCIALIST’S ECONOMICS DESERVE 'ONE-WAY TICKET TO FANTASYLAND'
Not surprisingly, then, 90% of hardware giant Home Depot customers are DIYers (do-it-yourselfers), though professional contracts are also a key part of their revenue stream. Of course, it’s typically a homeowner who retains that professional contractor who goes to Home Depot for flooring and kitchen cabinets.
Software may be the future — but hardware remains big business in America. Home Depot’s 2,300 outlets brought in $159 billion in 2024. Competitor big box chain Lowe’s' 1,700 stores brought in $83 billion. Some 1,700 smaller, local hardware stores use the True Value brand logo. In each of these, every day, some homeowner is coming in for the right size dry wall — or asking for advice, something Home Depot long ago realized drew in customers.

There’s a Home Depot in Odessa, Texas — but not in Odesa,Ukraine.There is good news about the latter, though. Since the time of my visit there, the Ukraine-owned ""hypermarket"" home improvement chain Epicentre started with one store in Kyiv in 1996, and in 2009 opened locations in Odesa. There’s now a private market for those Khrushchev-era apartments — an Odesa real estate website lists one for $21,000.
One can only hope that, to go along with homeownership and hardware stores, Odesa residents will be able to be secure that they will not have to continue to do repairs — from bomb damage. That combination — homeownership, hardware — implies the sort of freedom Americans too often take for granted on July 4.

The House and Senate have done their jobs, the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" has crossed the finish line. For frontline members of Congress across the country, this is more than just a legislative victory, it is a political boon heading into the upcoming midterms. This bill delivers real relief to hardworking Americans, and our main street members now have a clear message to take home: We kept our promises.
Thislaw protectsthe middle-class tax cuts that have fueled economic growth, expanded the child tax credit that so many families rely on, and ends taxes on tips and overtime, giving hourly workers the raise Washington never let them keep before. These wins are not abstract. They are personal, tangible, and powerful.
Let’s start with taxes. For the last several years, millions of families have benefited from lower individual tax rates that helped stretch paychecks further and keep small businesses afloat. But those cuts were set to expire. Had Congress failed to act, families across the country would have faced a surprise tax hike in the middle of an already uncertain economy. Now, those cuts are permanent, and our members can proudly say they stood on the side of working Americans.
CONGRESS SENDING TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' TO HIS DESK AFTER DRAMATIC ALL-NIGHT HOUSE VOTE
Just as important is what this bill does for hourly and tipped workers. In main street districts from Pennsylvania to Arizona, we hear the same stories: parents picking up extra shifts, waiters working double time during the holidays, and young adults balancing multiple part-time jobs to pay for school. For too long, Uncle Sam took a bite out of every extra effort. With this new law, overtime pay and tips will no longer be taxed. That money stays in workers’ pockets, where it belongs.
Our main street members understand thatrewarding hard workis not just good policy, it is common sense. This provision alone gives frontline Republicans a powerful contrast against the bureaucratic mindset that says Washington always knows best. Voters know who had their back, and who tried to block this relief.
Then there’s thechild tax credit. Expanding it was a priority for our members because families are the backbone of every community. Under this bill, more parents qualify, and the benefit reaches further into the middle class. Whether it's used for groceries, childcare, or saving for the future, this credit will make a difference in homes across America. It is direct, it is simple, and it shows that main street Republicans are putting families first.
Make no mistake, our members took tough votes to get this done. They stood strong in the face of partisan pressure, media spin, and the usual Washington gridlock. But now, they can return to their districts and point to a concrete achievement. Not rhetoric. Not talking points. Real, reform that helps the people they represent.

That is the power of this moment. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" shows what happens when we govern with purpose and principle. It offers our frontline members not just a victory to campaign on, but a foundation to build trust with voters who are tired of excuses and hungry for results.

Data indicating the federal workforce shrank by just 1% over the first few months of PresidentDonald Trump’ssecond term shows a ""disappointing effect of DOGE"" and the level of bureaucracy’s entrenchment in America, experts told Fox News Digital.
Figures released by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) show that the United States employs 2,289,472 federal workers as of March 31, which is down from 2,313,216 on September 30, 2024.  The reduction of more than 23,000 positions ""reflects the administration’s early efforts to streamline government and eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy,"" OPM said in a press release.
""That's just through the end of March. So I suspect those numbers will be higher by the end of September this year, which is when a lot of the early retirement packages– and buyouts – go into effect,"" Alex Nowrasteh, the Cato Institute’s vice president for economic and social policy studies, told Fox News Digital.
""Regardless of what those numbers are, this is not enough people having been terminated. It is not enough shrinkage in the federal workforce. And it is a disappointing effect ofDOGEthat it wasn't able to increase the size of the decrease in the federal workforce,"" he added.
‘ONLY THE BEGINNING’: TRUMP ADMINISTRATION RELEASES DATA SHOWING FEDERAL WORKFORCE SLASHED SINCE JANUARY

Trump signed an executive order in February instructing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to coordinate with federal agencies and execute massive cuts in federal government staffing numbers.
That order is reflected in the new data, OPM said, showing that agencies averaged 23,000 new monthly hires from April 2024 to January 2025 but dropped by nearly 70% to just 7,385 per month once the hiring freeze was fully implemented.

""It's very hard to get rid of people unless you get rid of functions. See, he was able to decimate USAID because he took away all their money,"" Morici said. ""It's very, very hard to cut down the Commerce Department unless you, for example, don't want the numbers collected.""
""It takes more than four years,"" Morici also said. ""Look at the problems they're having just with Medicare reform, how all the special interests come out. Over the years, the federal bureaucracy is not just in Washington, but it's been spread throughout the country.""
""And as you talk about cutting it down, you're talking about affecting local economies, the interests of congressmen, and so forth,"" he added.

David Hebert, an economist with the American Institute for Economic Research, said the reduction reported by OPM ""is certainly a start.""
""The real challenge that President Trump is facing is the fact that the federal government has taken upon itself far too many responsibilities,"" he added in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Tens of thousands of employees who are in the process of being terminated remain on the government payroll due to court orders that are currently being challenged by the administration, according to OPM.

Zohran Mamdani, the democratic socialist candidate for New York City mayor, has come under fire from critics who label him a ""communist"" – a charge he dismisses as a distraction.
However, the criticisms may not be as unfounded as Mamdani claims. Videos show the NYC mayoral candidate espousing language and theories rooted in communist revolutionary language.
In one 2021 video, Mamdani urges fellow socialists at a conference to not compromise on goals like""seizing the means of production.""In a second video, released on YouTube by progressive advocacy group The Gravel Institute that same year, Mamdani discusses the need to turn housing from a private commodity to a public one, calling for luxury condos to be replaced with communal style living that would include things like shared laundry facilities and food co-ops.
POLITIFACT DECLARES ZOHRAN MAMDANI IS NOT A COMMUNIST IN FACT-CHECK OF TRUMP

""Why do so many people end up homeless?"" Mamdani asks in the video. ""It's not because there aren't enough homes to go around, there are plenty of empty homes. No. It's because housing people is not a primary goal of developers or landlords. Their goal, simply put, is to make a profit.""
According to Mamdani, this is a problem. He lamented in the video that housing is ""a consumer product, just like clothes or cars"" that private businesses sell on the market to make a profit. As a result, Mamdani complains, there is plenty of housing for ""the rich"" but not nearly enough opportunities for poor and working-class people.
""[It's] not efficient or beneficial for the rest of society,"" Mamdani says. ""Housing doesn't have to be seen as a market at all.""

In the video, Mamdani points to post-war communist Vienna as an example of how removing privatization from thehousing marketcan be good for society. However, he does concede that currently in Vienna, ""residents still pay part of their earnings in rent to cover operational costs and a sizable chunk of the population lives in private housing.""
After describing the so-called Vienna model, during which he puts forth a vision of communal living with shared laundry, kitchens, food co-ops, bathhouses, pharmacies, lecture halls, swimming pools and more, he suggests a way forward that includes establishing ""community land trusts to gradually buy up housing on the private market and convert it to community ownership.""
""If we want to end the housing crisis, the solution has to be moving toward the full de-commodification of housing,"" Mamdani says. ""In other words, moving away from the status quo in which most people access housing by purchasing it on the market and toward a future where we guarantee high quality housing to all as a human right.""

President Donald Trump has referred to Mamdani as a ""100% Communist Lunatic"" and vowed to ""save New York City"" from Mamdani if he gets elected. He has suggested awillingness to withhold federal fundsfrom the city if Mamdani doesn't ""behave.""
""As President of the United States, I’m not going to let this Communist Lunatic destroy New York,"" Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social Wednesday.

I show them that in July of 2020 debt service was only $386 billion a year and the national debt was $26 trillion. I ask why would debt service be 2.6 times as high now when the national debt is ""only"" 1.4 times as high. The answer is that interest rates have gone up, greatly increasing the interest we pay on the debt.

I explain hyperinflation and pass around a couple 100 million Deutsche Mark bills from Germany in 1923. I tell the story of a German woman filling an old wheelbarrow with Deutsche Marks, going to the store, leaving it outside for a moment while she selected some bread and milk, then coming back to find the old wheelbarrow gone--and the worthless bills dumped out in the street.
We watch the 2009 Onion satirical video ""U.S. Government Stages Fake Coup To Wipe Out National Debt"" in which a newscaster informs viewers:
""The White House today enacted an emergency plan to eliminate all the United States’ financial obligations to foreign nations by faking a violent coup of the American government …the fake coup began at 10 a.m. today, when fake rebel leader Octavius Del Monte stormed Congress, pretended to kill several congressmen … then said ‘Hear my words China, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates. The U.S. and all its vast debt, no longer exists. Henceforth, this land will be called Octavia. Do not even try to collect funds owed!’""
INVISIBLE TAX: GOVERNMENT DEBT IS CRUSHING YOUR FINANCES
The newscaster then explains that ""Representatives on both sides of the aisle said the plan was the best option left for lowering our debt after ideas like burning down the country for the insurance money and disguising the nation as Canada were deemed infeasible.""
I ask the students why it seems almost comical how worried they were in 2009 about the national debt. There’s a pause. Then one student raises his hand, and answers, ruefully, ""Because it was only $10 trillion back then.""

President Donald Trumptook to Truth Social early Thursday to call out Republicans who are still refusing to get behind a House procedural vote on the ""Big Beautiful Bill.""
With the vote having stalled late Wednesday – with five Republican ""nays"" and another eightRepublicanshaving yet to cast a vote – the president touted the benefits the country is poised to gain with the bill’s passage.
""Largest Tax Cuts in History and a Booming Economy vs. Biggest Tax Increase in History, and a Failed Economy,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social before turning his ire to GOP holdouts: ""What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove??? MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!""

Trump later wrote that the vote should be an ""EASY YES"" for Republicans, calling the holdouts’ refusal to vote, ""RIDICULOUS.""
A procedural ""rule vote"" allows lawmakers to debate ahead of a final vote on the ""Big Beautiful Bill"" before it would head to the president’s desk for a signature.
By early Thursday, the following House Republicans were a no on the procedural vote: Reps. Andrew Clyde of Georgia, Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, Keith Self of Texas, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, and Thomas Massie of Kentucky – who changed his vote from a ""yay"" to a ""nay.""
When asked why he switched his vote, Massie told Fox News Digital, ""Because most of the world isn’t concerned about the difference between the rule resolution vote and the final passage vote.""

Leaving a room with other holdouts and critics of the bill just after 1 a.m. on Thursday, Burchett told reporters, ""We're just getting very close, I think, to getting something resolved.""
He would not say how he would vote for the legislation, however.
GOP lawmakers can only afford to lose three votes. Republican leaders have now kept the rule vote open for over four hours to try to pressure the holdouts to get a majority vote.
House Speaker Mike Johnson had recalled lawmakers to Washington, eager to seize on the momentum of the bill's passage the day before in the Senate and vowed to press ahead.
""Everybody wants to get to yes,"" Johnson told Fox News as the voting was underway.

Quickly convening for the vote on the more than 800-page bill was risky gambit, one designed to meet Trump's demand for a holiday finish. Republicans have struggled mightily with the bill nearly every step of the way this year, often succeeding by the narrowest of margins, only one vote.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-appointed-judge-halts-trump-hhs-overhaul-after-democrat-led-lawsuit,Biden-appointed judge halts Trump HHS overhaul after Democrat-led lawsuit,"'Outnumbered' panelists weigh in after President Donald Trump celebrated a 'giant win' from the Supreme Court, which limited lower courts' ability to block federal policies.
A Biden-appointed federal judge on Tuesday stepped in to halt the Trump administration's efforts to dramatically reorganize theDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS)after 19 Democratic attorneys general sued to stop the reforms.
HHS announced in March it would be laying off around 20,000 full-time agency employees, while also reducing the number of regional offices across the country and consolidating several HHS divisions. A fact sheet from HHS about the cuts said the reforms were aimed at making the agency more efficient, saving money and ensuring Americans' most critical health needs are adequately met.
In response, 19 Democratic state attorneys general sued to block the Trump administration's reforms. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose granted a temporary injunction in their favor.

DuBose's ruling Tuesday temporarily blocks the Trump administration from enforcing its proposed workforce reduction or sub-agency restructuring, and HHS was also ordered to file a status report by July 11.
""We stand by our original decision to realign this organization with its core mission and refocus a sprawling bureaucracy that, over time, had become wasteful, inefficient and resistant to change,"" HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in response to the ruling.
""The reorganization was designed to restore the department around bold, measurable public health goals like reversing thechronic disease epidemicand advancing U.S. leadership in biomedical research. While we strongly disagree with the decision by a Biden-appointed district court judge, HHS remains committed to modernizing a health workforce that for too long prioritized institutional preservation over meaningful public health impact.""

Last month, the Supreme Court limited the use of nationwide injunctions to halt President Donald Trump'sexecutive actions.
However, the ruling did not shut the door on legal challenges to Trump's executive orders.

""HHS is the backbone of our nation’s public health and social safety net – from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, one of the 19 state attorneys general who sued to stop the Trump administration's reduction in force at HHS.
""Today's order guarantees these programs and services will remain accessible and halts the administration’s attempt to sabotage our nation’s healthcare system. My office will continue fighting to stop this unlawful dismantling and defend the essential services that protect our most vulnerable communities.""

Chick-fil-A was voted the highest in customer satisfaction for the 11th consecutive year, according to the newest American Consumer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) rankings released in June.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/politicians-push-job-killing-minimum-wage-hikes-while-ignoring-devastating-economic-reality,Politicians push job-killing minimum wage hikes while ignoring the devastating economic reality,"National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett explains how Democrats were wrong in critiquing President Donald Trump’s economic plan on ‘The Ingraham Angle.’
Despite it being widely known by anyone who can think two steps ahead that price controls have negative consequences, politicians can’t help but continue to promoteprice controlsas policy.
With Americans facing increased costs of living, there has been a return to calling for minimum wage hikes from democratic socialists like New York City Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, who wants to raise the minimum wage in the city to $30/hour, to RepublicanSen. Josh Hawley, who is bafflingly pushing an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15/hour with additional increases indexed to inflation.
If wages could be raised by mandate without negative consequences, why would we stop there? Why not make the minimum wage $100/hour, $100,000/hour or even a cool $1 million/hour?
Zohran Mamdani, mayoral candidate for New York City, speaks at a rally held by the Working Families Party at Foley Square in New York City, May 10, 2025.(Reuters/Bing Guan)
Because in real life, that’s not the way things work.
TRUMP’S ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ COULD CEMENT ECONOMIC LEGACY FOR DECADES
The minimum wage has always been an evil policy, rooted in racism. It was passed as legislation precisely to exclude unskilled workers, particularly immigrants, minorities and women, from the workforce. It has the same effect today.
But the financially illiterate don’t seem to understandbasic economics.
The minimum wage is not an average wage, median wage, maximum wage or even an expected wage. It is quite literally a floor (although, as economist Thomas Sowell has pointed out, the real minimum wage is zero). As reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (""BLS"") via FRED, only 1% of workers report being paid at or below the federal minimum wage, and that data is ""based solely on the hourly wage they report (which does not include overtime pay, tips or commissions).""
LEFT, LEFTER AND LEFTIST: DEMOCRATS COULD BE DEFINED BY RADICAL, BIG CITY MAYORS
Sen. Josh Hawley asks questions during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Jan. 15, 2025.(Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)
The minimum wage is heavily slanted toward teens and workersentering the workforcewith few skills. As the BLS noted, ""Minimum wage workers tend to be young. Although workers under age 25 represented one-fifth of hourly paid workers, they accounted for 43% of those paid the federal minimum wage or less.""
While minimum wage directly impacts a small number of individuals, its effects ripple throughout the economy at large. If teens and unskilled workers have a guaranteed wage floor, those with skills and experience will want to be compensated even more.
That increases bothwages and taxes paidfor a business throughout their labor force, as well as that of all their suppliers, adding substantially to operating costs and reducing what may already be slim operating margins. The businesses will either have to make less money or pass on costs to consumers – or both.
This makes products and services more expensive and, in many cases, will put businesses out of business across the economy as every company now competes in a market where nonskilled workers have a high fixed cost set by government.
NEW YORK'S SOCIALIST NIGHTMARE IS JUST BEGINNING BUT THERE'S STILL A WAY OUT
Sometimes, businesses will also reduce product sizes or service offerings – shrinkflation, as we saw under the last administration – but one way or another, that increase in labor cost flows through the economy and impacts what you are able to get for your dollars.
It’s notable that small business owners, who often work well in excess of 40 hours of week and risk their own capital, don’t get a guaranteed wage, but politicians are happy to make entrepreneurial effortsmore risky and costly.
The minimum wage, particularly the federal proposals, don’t take into account different economic costs by region or geographic area, either.
Just because bad policy exists doesn’t mean that we should keep doubling down on it. Pay should be negotiated between parties based on value and demand for skills and services.

An economy cannot function without being able to get people into the workforce and trained. We need to keep jobs where people can enter the workforce, learn skills and, if desired, move on in their career paths.
At a time whenAI is threatening jobs, and technology is replacing workers, enacting legislation that incentivizes fewer jobs and makes it more costly and difficult to run a business is patently insane.
Wages will naturally shift with the market for labor, as we have seen in recent years. Politicians who are trying to ""help"" will once again find that intentions do not equate to outcomes, and their policies only make the cost-of-living issues worse.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/socialist-mayoral-candidate-zohran-mamdani-under-fire-plan-tax-richer-whiter-neighborhoods,Socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani under fire for plan to tax 'richer and whiter neighborhoods',"Rep. Laura Gillen, D-N.Y., reacts to Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani winning New York City’s mayoral primary race.
Socialist Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is facing criticism over a campaign policy document that explicitly calls for shifting the city’s tax burden onto ""richer and whiter neighborhoods.""
Mamdani caused a political earthquake in this week’s primary, trouncing former New York Gov.Andrew Cuomoin a stunning upset, all but securing his place on the November ballot. Housing affordability has been a central pillar of his campaign.
Apolicy documenttitled ""Stop the Squeeze on NYC Homeowners"" from Mamdani’s mayoral campaign website argues that the city’s current property tax system disproportionately benefits wealthy, White homeowners, particularly in Manhattan and affluent areas of Brooklyn, by allowing them to pay far less in taxes due to outdated assessment caps.

CITY-RUN GROCERY STORES, DEFUNDING POLICE, SAFE INJECTION SITES: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT NYC'S NEXT POTENTIAL MAYOR
In contrast, Black, Latino and immigrant homeowners in neighborhoods like Brownsville and Jamaica in the outer borough of Queens are overburdened and at higher risk of foreclosure.
His solution?
""Shift the tax burden from overtaxed homeowners in the outer boroughs to more expensive homes in richer and whiter neighborhoods,"" the proposal reads. ""The property tax system is unbalanced because assessment levels are artificially capped, so homeowners in expensive neighborhoods pay less than their fair share.""
The proposal would reduce the taxable portion of assessed property values citywide, and offset that by raising actual tax rates in wealthier areas. The result: lower tax bills for lower-income neighborhoods and higher ones for affluent areas — which the campaign describes as ""richer and whiter.""
The racial component of the policy position has come in for criticism online, with broadcaster Mark Levinsharing a New York Poststory about the proposal and writing ""Oh, and Mamdani is racist, too.""
Political commentator Eric Daugherty also brandished it as explicitly ""racist"" on X, while the New York Post editorial board also slammed the proposal as ""pure racism.""
Fox News Digital reached out to Mamdani’s campaign for comment but did not immediately receive a response.
The campaign document also highlights racial disparities in deed theft and ""tangled titles,"" which are situations where someone lives in a home they believe they own — often through inheritance — but their name is not on the deed, creating legal uncertainty about ownership.
The document states that predominantly Black neighborhoods face these challenges at much higher rates than White neighborhoods.
To address this, Mamdani is proposing a $10 million ""Tangled Title Fund"" to help city residents hire lawyers and clear legal titles so they can secure full homeownership rights and benefits.
REPUBLICANS USE MAMDANI BOMBSHELL VICTORY OVER CUOMO AS AMMUNITION TO BLAST DEMOCRATS AS EXTREMISTS
Mamdani is a member of theDemocratic Socialists of America, whose preamble discusses a way to ""end white supremacy and racial oppression because its destruction is in the interest of all workers, including white workers.""
Overall, the housing document frames the city’s housing inequities as structurally racist and economically unjust.
The document also claims that the city’s tax lien sale system is exploitative and racist. When a homeowner falls behind on property taxes under the system, the city sells that debt to a private trust of Wall Street-backed investors, usually at a discount. instead of collecting the debt directly.
""The tax lien sale has been particularly harmful to Black, brown, and working-class homeowners, leading many homeowners to lose their home to foreclosure, or forcing them to sell below market value in order to pay off their accumulating debts,"" the document reads. ""The city is six times more likely to sell a tax lien in a Black neighborhood than a white neighborhood. This policy is extracting wealth from Black, brown, and working-class communities and stripping New Yorkers of their homes.""

Mamdani said he will end the system on his first day in office and create a new tax collection system that provides ""additional opportunities"" for homeowners to enter into payment plans, pay down their debt and stay in their homes.
The Queens assemblyman wants to build 200,000 new publicly-subsidized affordable homes and immediately freeze rents for the city’s 2.4 million stabilized tenants. His proposals call for multi-year rent freezes and massive investment inpublic housing. Critics argue his proposals could worsen existing problems in the rental market,

The bosses of America's largest teachers' unions appear to have taken opposite stances on the recentSupreme Courtruling about LGBTQ books in school, with one saying the ""expertise of trained educational professionals"" should have been deferred to, while the other said, ""Parents must have a say.""
On Friday, the justices decided 6-3 inMahmoud v. Taylorthat parents could opt their children out of a Maryland public school system's lessons that contain themes about homosexuality and transgenderism if they feel the material conflicts with their religious faith.
""Students pay the price when books are censored and educators are silenced,"" National Education Association President Becky Pringlesaidin reaction to the decision on BlueSky.
""Today, in the ruling on Mahmoud v. Taylor, the Supreme Court failed students. They have discounted and ignored the expertise of trained educational professionals, and harmed students in the process,"" she added. ""Shameful.""
The bosses of America's largest teachers' unions appear to have taken opposing stances on the recent Supreme Court ruling that sided with parents who sought to shield children from LGBTQ books in school.
AUTHORS BLAST 'HARMFUL' SCOTUS RULING ALLOWING PARENTS TO OPT KIDS OUT OF READING THEIR LGBTQ+ BOOKS
The NationalEducationAssociation is the largest teachers' union in the country, presiding over 3 million members.
However, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said on Friday that parents and families should be respected.
""We have to respect all children and all families. Bad facts make bad law. Mahmoud should have been worked out on a local level, it's a shame it went all the way to SCOTUS,"" Weingarten said. ""Parents must have a say about their own kids, they are our partners in education.""

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR CASE ON LGBTQ-THEMED STORYBOOKS AND PARENTS’ RIGHT TO OPT OUT
Weingarten shared similar sentiments on ""The Story"" in April, when the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on the case.
""This is something that has to be happening at the local level and not in the Supreme Court,"" Weingarten said, while also noting that the books containing LGBTQ content are not ones she would read to children.
The two teachers' union bosses usually align in political views, having both endorsed Vice PresidentKamala Harrisin the 2024 election.
(Parents, school boards and teachers' unions have battled over what books are appropriate in schools.)
In the past, Weingarten has pushed back on book challenges from parents. In 2023,Weingarten launched a hotlinecalled ""Freedom to Teach and Learn"" to report instances of book banning and challenges against curricula.
Weingarten, the leader of the 1.7 million-member union, claimed at the time that ""MAGA lawmakers have used culture wars to divide communities and other schemes that drain resources from public education.""

""Hey @50cent, make it a one-way ticket to Fantasyland, he’ll fit right in,"" Adams said in a Monday X post that included a screenshot of what appears to be a since-deleted post from 50 Cent where the rapper challenged Mamdani’s policy ideas.

Adams, who was elected as a Democrat in 2021 but recently announced he wouldrun as an independentthis year followinglow approval ratingsand federal corruption charges that have since been dropped, has said there is ""no dignity"" in socialism.

""We're talking about corporations that are making millions of dollars, not in revenue, but in profit,"" Mamdani said. ""And the second is taxing the top 1% of New Yorkers. We're talking about people who make a million dollars a year or more, taxing them just by a flat 2% tax increase.""
Mamdani also mentioned 50 Cent by name, saying, ""I know if 50 Cent is listening, he's not going to be happy about this. He tends to not like this tax policy, but I want to be very clear this is about $20,000 a year. It's a rounding error. And all of these things together, they make every New Yorker's life better, including those who are actually getting taxed now.""

The Trump administration is working on a way to allow farmers and the hospitality industry to have a ""temporary pass"" to avoid a negative impact from Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, he said on ""Sunday Morning Futures.""
""I don’t back away. What I do have, I cherish our farmers,"" the president said when asked by host Maria Bartiromo about the issue. ""And when we go into a farm and we take away people that have been working there for 15 and 20 years, who were good, who possibly came in incorrectly. And what we’re going to do is we’re going to do something for farmers where we can let the farmer sort of be in charge. The farmer knows he’s not going to hire a murderer.""
""But you know, when you go into a farm and you set somebody working with them for nine years doing this kind of work, which is hard work to do and a lot of people aren’t going to do it, and you end up destroying a farmer because you took all the people away,"" he said.

""It’s a problem. You know, I’m on both sides of the thing.

""We’re working on it right now. We’re going to work it so that, some kind of a temporary pass, where people pay taxes, where the farmer can have a little control as opposed to you walk in and take everybody away,"" he continued, emphasizing that ""criminals are going out of this country.""

ICE and DHS referred to the White House, and the White House deferred to the president’s remarks when Fox News Digital reached out. The comments from the president come as the administration aims to ramp up deportation efforts, whether it’s those with criminal charges and convictions or who entered the country illegally under the Biden administration. At the border itself, apprehensions and gotaway figures have taken a nosedive since Trump took office.
DHS is also encouraging those without acriminal history to self-deportby offering $1,000 and free travel outside the United States. ICE operations have been the subject of protests and even riots, including in Los Angeles.

A group of millennials recently took to Reddit to reminisce about how cheapfast foodused to be, as well as lament how much the price has risen since their childhoods.
On a popular subreddit filled with 800,000 users born between 1981 and 1996, a recent post focused on the price of food in 1991.
A user shared a graphic stating that aMcDonald's feastonce cost only $12, including 99 cents for medium fries, 79 cents for a cheeseburger and $1.85 for a Big Mac.

The graphic also claimed that a Filet-o-Fish cost just $1.29 in 1991 and a medium drink went for 89 cents.
The post was upvoted by over 5,200 users and attracted over 400 commenters with varied reactions.

Because prices varied by location, the claims in the graphic could not be confirmed, but the lower prices were familiar to many commenters.
Many of the Redditors said they fondly remembered the old prices and the quality ofthe food.
""Anyone remember the 29-cent hamburgers and 39-cent cheeseburgers?"" one person asked.

""I feel like the sweet spot for McDonald's was 2008. The dollar menu was insane,"" one person said.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/loeffler-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill-could-cement-economic-legacy-decades,"LOEFFLER: Trump’s ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ could cement economic legacy for decades","White House Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, joined Fox News Digital for an exclusive interview as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is debated in the Senate.
After four years of record prices, regulation and low growth, America’s economy is regaining strength. Inflation is at a four-year low. Wage growth is strong, with more than 620,000 new jobs added since January. Business investment is accelerating and optimism is returning. Underpinning that momentum is PresidentDonald Trump’s pro-growth policies – and the small businesses his agenda is built to strengthen.
With the""One Big, Beautiful Bill Act of 2025,""Republicans are working to solidify Trump’s agenda with the most sweeping tax and entitlement overhaul ever – to ensure the Main Street comeback isn’t temporary, but lasting.
Since February, I’ve traveled across the country meeting with small business owners in nearly every sector – from family farms and factory floors to the Main Street cornerstones of restaurants and retailers. Their message is clear: they don’t want bailouts, bigger tax bills or bureaucracy. They want a tax code that enables them to plan for the long term, puts more money in their pockets, and rewards – not punishes – work, entrepreneurship and growth. This bill delivers on all three.
THE ‘ONE BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ URGENTLY NEEDS A MAKEOVER TO USHER IN TRUMP’S GOLDEN AGE
Thanks toTrump’s commitment to ending wasteful spending,data shows that inflation is no longer the top concern for small businesses. Today, the threat of rising taxes has taken the top spot. Unless Congress acts soon, the 2017 Trumptax cutswill expire, raising the top tax rate on small business pass-through income to 43.4%. That would hit more than two-thirds of small business owners, most of whom file taxes as individuals.

The""One Big, Beautiful Bill""prevents the largest tax hike in history. It makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent, including the Section 199A deduction – leaving more capital in the hands of America’s 34 millionsmall business ownersto hire, expand and reinvest in their operations. This provision alone is projected to create 1 million new jobs on Main Street and generate $750 billion in economic activity over the next decade.
The bill also keeps cash in the wallets of blue-collar Americans. With no taxes on tips or overtime, it raises take-home pay for our workers without increasing costs for their employers. It repeals the IRS’s $600 reporting rule, which created compliance headaches for millions of gig economy workers and small sellers. It increases the Child Tax Credit and standard deduction for working families. And it protects family farms from the death tax – preserving generational assets rather than taxing them twice.
TRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER'
To address the post-pandemic labor shortage, the bill incentivizes work, with work requirements for able-bodied adults without dependents receivingMedicaid benefits,bringing nearly 4.8 million Americans back into the workforce and removing 1.4 million illegal aliens who do not qualify for Medicaid. At a time when small businesses are still struggling to hire, this is a necessary step to align government incentives with opportunity to pursue the American Dream.

The legislation also reinforces a key goal of Trump’s economic vision:Made in America.Companies that manufacture here will benefit from targeted tax incentives, including interest deduction for American-made vehicles. They can take advantage of full expensing for investments in capital and equipment, R&D and factory construction. These provisions don’t just encourage domestic production – they renew our industrial base and create good-paying jobs for American workers.
Finally, the bill tackles one of the most overlooked obstacles to small business success:regulatory overreachand costs. Under the Biden administration, Washington added an estimated $5.8 trillion in new regulations. The ""One Big, Beautiful Bill"" reins in those costs, clears out bureaucratic red tape, and restores a business climate where job creators can focus on growing – not just staying afloat.
IT'S TIME FOR CONGRESS TO DELIVER PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' TO HIS DESK
Support for the bill spans party lines – just not in Washington. A majority ofsmall business owners,including many left-leaning entrepreneurs, back the legislation’s core provisions. That’s because these ideas aren’t ideological – they’re practical. They reflect the real-world perspectives of the people who show up every day to keep our communities running.

Unlike his predecessor, Trump has never lost sight of those who drive the American economy. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" is a reflection of his commitment to working families and small businesses. It delivers real tax relief, trims Washington overreach, rewards work and puts small businesses back where they belong – at the center of America’s success story.
Congress should act without delay. Small businesses are ready to keep building, hiring and innovating - this time with most in Washington finally behind them.

https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/bartenders-spill-beans-gen-zs-annoying-drink-by-drink-payment-habit,Bartenders spill the beans on Gen Z's 'annoying' drink-by-drink payment habit,"Derek Brown, D.C.-based author of ""Mindful Mixology: A Comprehensive Guide to No- and Low-Alcohol Cocktails,"" reveals how to differentiate between the non-traditional alcoholic offerings.
In bars across America, fewer young bargoers – those born in the late 1990s or early 2000s – are opening tabs, instead choosing to close out and pay afterevery drink, The New York Times recently reported.
Does the trend bother bartenders? Fox News Digital asked a few for their thoughts.
""Is it annoying to close out the tab after every single drink for bartenders? And the answer is yes. Unequivocally, that is annoying,"" said Derek Brown, a bartender and founder of Drink Company, a hospitality consulting agency in Washington, D.C.
SPLITTING A RESTAURANT BILL WITH FRIENDS? EXPERT SHARES 'MOST DESIRABLE' APPROACH
""You have so many things to do as a bartender throughout your shift, and closing out the tab, if you have to do it throughout the evening when somebody's ordering two, three drinks — it takes time, and it's frustrating and annoying.""
Today's younger generation isn't the first to annoy bartenders, Brown clarified.
Younger bargoers are frustrating bartenders by paying for drinks one by one rather than opening a tab for the evening.(iStock)
""Every generation has its quirk,"" he said.
Still, while it may not seem like a big deal to customers, closing out after every drink is a nuisance to those on the other side ofthe bar, especially when things are busy, Brown said.
""When somebody comes in and says, 'I'll takea cocktail,'great, and then somebody comes behind and says, 'I'll close it out,' you have to turn around, you have to go to the [point-of-sale machine], and you have to turn around and go back to making drinks,"" Brown said.
CRAFT BREWERS NAVIGATE RISING COSTS WITHOUT PASSING HEFTY PRICE HIKES TO CUSTOMERS
""All of this while being congenial, keeping a smile, making sure people are taken care of — it can be just a really, really annoying habit between all the other things you have to do. But it is part of the job.""
Some younger people claim that paying as they go is a better way to manage their drinking money.
""Once you've had two drinks, then the third one comes a lot faster and easier.""
""This is the positive side of this, right?"" Brown said. ""If you're closing out every time, it's true. You're going to be able to monitorhow much alcoholyou're drinking throughout the evening.""
Brown said ""fiscal responsibility"" is important from the consumer perspective.
Some young drinkers believe paying as they go is the best way to manage their money when visiting a bar.(iStock)
""Once you've had two drinks, then the third one comes a lot faster and easier,"" he said.
Others have expressed concerns about leavingtheir credit cardsbehind or in the hands of the bartender.
One way bars solved this problem was with a new system in which a customer's card is swiped once and then immediately returned.
RESTAURANT TIPPING ETIQUETTE: SHOULD YOU TIP FOR FAST FOOD OR TAKEOUT?
""In that case, it's not that difficult,"" Brown said. ""You keep your card. You put it in your pocket. That's what we learned.""
Still, nothing stops a person from paying drink by drink.
""Somebody can just keep asking to open and close it [all] evening,"" Brown said. ""We just have to smile and do our best.""
Most bartenders can swipe cards and give them back to customers, but that doesn't stop people from paying drink by drink.(iStock)
Another reason for the decline in bar tabs could be that fewer young adults, in general, are drinking.

A 2023 Gallup poll found that 62% of adults under age 35 say they drink, a 10% decrease over the previous 20 years.
""It depends on what kind of night I'm trying to have.""
Katie Fites, a former bartender in Tallahassee and recent graduate of Florida State University, said she doesn't have a blanket rule when deciding whether she's going to open a bar tab.

""It depends on what kind of night I'm trying to have,"" she told Fox News Digital.
""If I know that my friends and I are going to be staying in one spot for the night, I will leave a tab open. But if I think that we're going to be bouncing around and there's a possibility I'll forget I've left my tab open and leave, I will not leave my tab open.""

Fites worked at a popular college bar that didn't allow tabs — so most people paid in cash.
Those who did pay with a card, however, were subject to a $10 minimum.

Card payments can not only slow down bartenders on a busy night, they can also be costly to a bar owner's bottom line.

Nicknamed ""The Book House,"" the home was custom-designed to evoke the feel of a historic German village cottage, according to news agency SWNS.

""My goal was to seamlessly blend charm and character with the luxury and comfort expected in today’s most finely appointed homes,"" said Marshall.(Vitality Pictures / SWNS)
""That’s why I designed it to operate as a high-end short-term rental: to increase revenue and share it with guests from all over,"" he added.
The quirky home was recently featured on ""Zillow Gone Wild"" — which shared the comment, ""Imagine sleeping surrounded by books. The dreams you will HAVE.""

Despite the policy challenges facingPresident Donald Trump’s""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" White House Director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, was unfazed, telling Fox News Digital on Wednesday that he doesn’t ""expect that there's going to be any issue"" with current language in the legislation.
""I think that what's going on right now is that people are going through really, almost basically, the footnotes,"" Hassett said in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital. ""They're arguing over last-minute language.""
Hassett’s comments come after reports that House GOPmembers are concernedabout the version of the bill coming out of the Senate, which would make its way to the House shortly after.

With thin margins in both the House and Senate, consensus among Republicans is critical. The first version of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" passed the House last month by just one vote.
As to the pendulum swing between the two chambers, Hassett raised no concerns with congressional drama, saying he doesn’t ""expect that there’s going to be any issue there at all.""
""I've been briefed on the difference between the Senate and the House language on this matter,"" Hassett told Fox. ""And the differences are incredibly small, and so I don't expect that there's going to be any issue there at all.""
SENATE REPUBLICANS LOOK TO SWEETEN MEDICAID POT TO SILENCE DISSENT ON TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'
Hassett also made clear the main elements of President Trump’s agenda are ""hardwired into the bill"" and that current debates are just items ""around the edges"" of the White House’s key proponents.

""We're making the president's first tax cuts permanent,"" Hassett explained. ""No tax on overtime, no tax tips, no tax on social security, we're securing the border, we're building the Golden Dome. All that stuff is hardwired into the bill.""
""What they're arguing about now is stuff around the edges of that.""
TRUMP TELLS CONGRESS: NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL THE 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' IS DONE
The president himself has pushed hard for the legislation to be passed quickly, and asked Congress to work toward having the bill signed into law by the Fourth of July.

50 Cent offered to pay for New York City Democratic mayoralcandidate Zohran Mamdanito leave the state on Wednesday after learning about his tax plan from an interview that referenced the rapper.
The video he referenced was from ""The Breakfast Club"" podcast on June 11 where Mamdani appeared while campaigning for the Democratic primary earlier this month. During the interview, Mamdani explained his goal of raising corporate taxes to pay for plans to ""Trump-proof"" the city.
""We're talking about corporations that are making millions of dollars, not in revenue, but in profit,"" Mamdani said. ""And the second is taxing the top 1% of New Yorkers. We're talking about people who make a million dollars a year or more, taxing them just by a flat 2% tax increase.""

He added, ""I know if 50 Cent is listening, he's not going to be happy about this. He tends to not like this tax policy, but I want to be very clear this is about $20,000 a year. It's a rounding error. And all of these things together, they make every New Yorker's life better, including those who are actually getting taxed now.""
50 Cent, whose real name is Curtis James Jackson III, later responded to Mamdani’s comments on Instagram.
""Where did he come from? Whose friend is this? I’m not feeling this plan. No. I will give him $258,750 and a first class one-way ticket away from NY. I’m telling Trump what he said too!""50 Cent wrote.

50 Cent notablyendorsed President Donald Trumpin 2020 after learning that then-candidate Joe Biden’s tax plan would tax New York at a rate of 58% and New York City at a rate of 62%.
""WHAT THE F--K! (VOTE For TRUMP) IM OUT,"" Jackson wrote on Instagram. ""F--K NEW YORK The KNICKS never win anyway. I don’t care Trump doesn’t like black people 62% are you out of ya f--king mind."" He later walked back that endorsement.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/desantis-predicts-florida-property-values-skyrocket-nyc-dem-socialist-nominee-wins,DeSantis predicts Florida property values will ‘skyrocket’ if NYC Dem socialist nominee wins,"The Free Press staff writer Olivia Reingold joins 'The Story' to discuss the New York City mayoral race as she reacts to the Democratic primary.
Florida Republican GovernorRon DeSantisis predicting property values in Palm Beach will ""skyrocket"" if Democratic socialist nominee Zohran Mamdani wins the mayor’s race in New York City this November.
Mamdani, a Ugandan immigrant and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, won theDemocratic Party’s nomination for New York City mayor on Tuesday night. Running a campaign in which he promised a slew of free services, Mamdani defeated former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who was highly favored to win. His victory has caused alarm among both Republicans and Democrats, with some predicting a Mamdani administration would lead to a mass exodus from America’s largest city.
""Just when you thought Palm Beach real estate couldn’t go any higher…"" DeSantis said on X in response to Mamdani taking the lead overCuomo, a quip playing off south Florida as a long-favored relocation destination for New Yorkers.
Speaking shortly before the primary election on Tuesday, DeSantis said, ""if this socialist mayor candidate wins inNew York City, you’re going to see real estate values skyrocket in Palm Beach because people are going to get out of that city.""

""As bad as De Blasio was,"" DeSantis went on, ""this guy is going to be way, way worse.""
""He doesn’t think that we should have law enforcement in dangerous parts of the city, that you should send in social workers. See how that works out for you, it ain’t going to work out well. So, they’ve made a lot of dumb decisions, and we’ve benefited from it,"" he quipped.
Florida’s Voicereported DeSantis also commenting, ""if this guy gets in, we may need to up our police recruitment bonuses"" because ""you’re going to see a flood of people.""
DeSantis added that ""when you have a candidate who wants to abolish the NYPD,"" that ""ain’t going to end well.""

A look through Mamdani’s platform, available on his campaign website, lives up to his socialist affiliation and endorsements by Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.
He has promised to immediately freeze rent prices for more than 2 million New Yorkers living in rent-stabilized apartments, implement free public transit, create a network of city-owned grocery stores that are ""focused on keeping prices low, not making a profit"" and institute free universal childcare for children from ages 6 weeks to 5 years.
He has also promised to create a New York City Department of Community Safety that he says will deploy outreach workers in 100 subway stations, expand gun violence prevention programs, and increase funding to ""hate violence prevention programs"" by 800%.
Mamdani has also pledged to champion a law to raise the minimum wage in New York City to $30 an hour by 2030.

Mamdani’s website says that he plans to raise the corporate tax rate to 11.5%, which he says will bring in an extra $5 billion. He plans to further set a flat 2% tax on those earning above $1 million annually, which he believes will bring in an extra $4 billion a yearin taxes. He has also said he will hire more tax auditors, end no-bid contracts and crack down on fine collection from ""corrupt landlords"" to raise an additional $1 billion.

Republicans and Democrats alike have criticized Mamdani’s record. Trump has also weighed in, saying that ""this is a big moment in the History of our Country"" in which ""the Democrats have crossed the line"" with Mamdani’s nomination.
""Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor,"" Trump posted on Truth Social. ""We’ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hud-becomes-first-major-cabinet-agency-exit-dc-citing-failing-hq-which-doge-wants-sell,"HUD becomes first major cabinet agency to exit DC, citing ‘failing’ HQ -- which DOGE wants to sell","Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner spoke to Fox News Digital.
EXCLUSIVE: The Department ofHousing and Urban Development(HUD) and the Commonwealth of Virginia will announce Wednesday that the agency will be the first major cabinet department to relocate out of Washington, D.C. during President Donald Trump’s term.
Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and HUD Secretary Scott Turner are set to christen the agency’s new home at the already existing National Science Foundation (NSF) building in Alexandria’s Carlyle-Eisenhower neighborhood, which is also home to a Wegman's grocery store, a movie theater and several shops and high-end restaurants.
HUD’s current headquarterson L’Enfant Plaza is also on the Senate DOGE Caucus’ list of buildings they want to see sold off to save taxpayer funds. The curved X-shaped granite building, officially called the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, is ""underutilized,"" according to their rubric.
Turner noted that the relocation will unlock hundreds of millions in taxpayer savings and address serious health concerns among staff at L’Enfant.
‘FOR SALE’: DOGE MOVES TO SELL OFF ALMOST HALF A BILLION IN FEDERAL REAL ESTATE, RELOCATE CABINET AGENCY HQS
""It is time to turn the page on the Weaver Building and relocate to a new headquarters that prioritizes the well-being of HUD employees and properly reflects the passion and excellence of our team,"" Turner told Fox News Digital.
""There are serious concerns with the current state of HUD’s headquarters, including health hazards, leaks, and structural and maintenance failures. Many of these risks will needlessly and irresponsibly continue to absorb taxpayer dollars. Relocating is about more than just changing buildings; it’s about a mission-minded shift that we hope will inspire every employee.""
Turner, a former Washington Redskins cornerback, added that it also aligns with President Donald Trump’s vision for a ""New American Golden Age.""
Youngkin was equally enthused about HUD’s move to the Old Dominion.
HUD SECRETARY SCOTT TURNER LAYS OUT AGENCY WINS DURING FIRST 100 DAYS, SHARES PRIORITIES FOR NEXT 100
""Virginia is a great place to be headquartered, and we are excited to welcome the Department of Housing and Urban Development and their over 2,700 headquarters-based employees to the best state in America to live, work, and raise a family,"" Youngkin told Fox News Digital.
Amid plans bythen-Elon Musk-led DOGEto relocate federal workers, Youngkin faced criticism for not speaking out more forcefully against the administration — criticism that largely fizzled after Wednesday’s announcement revealed the new headquarters would be just a few stops from downtown Washington on the Metro’s Yellow Line.
""Since the Trump administration started transforming the federal government to better serve the American people, our team has been focused on seizing the new opportunities that this presents for the commonwealth,"" Youngkin said. ""Virginia is the proud home to many public and private sector headquarters, and we thank HUD leadership for trusting us and are committed to supporting your important national mission.""
Youngkin had taken slings and arrows over his support forsuch DOGE efforts, including from Virginia Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Mount Vernon, who previously criticized his position onfederal worker relocation.
""This is about people's jobs, their lives, their ability to support their families, and it's about the future of the Virginia economy,"" Surovelltold VPM.
The HUD relocation, however, falls just across Cameron Run Creek from Surovell’s district.
Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, the Senate DOGE committee chairwoman, praised Youngkin and Turner for the move.
""The Robert C. Weaver Building is a vacant and run-down monument to waste with half a billion dollars in overdue maintenance,"" Ernst said, calling it a ""cross between a ghost town and a horror show.""
""It is a true federal fixer-upper and perfect candidate to be put on the auction block.My For Sale Actwill sell off this and five other money pits to downsize Washington’s portfolio of underutilized buildings, generate $400 million in revenue, and save taxpayers billions in maintenance.""
Michael Peters, the commissioner of the General Services Administration, which manages federal real estate, praised the move to Virginia, saying it reflects his agency’s commitment to fiscal responsibility and ""mission effectiveness.""
Investments to-date in the Weaver building totaled $90 million over the past 15 years, including plaza, roof and façade repairs.
HUD expects ""significant demand"" from the private sector for its old home – located just east of the Smithsonian, south of the National Mall and within walking distance of the new Waterfront Wharf social area.

Mold and asbestos containment have plagued the building, which also has only about half of its elevators in working operation.
The agency also noted there are about 1,000 more employees at HUD versus NSF – which they calculated to effect a $51-per-square-foot savings on building usage and maintenance.

Buried in the budget reconciliation package recently passed by the House is a moratorium that would block every U.S. state from passing laws onartificial intelligence or automationfor the next decade.
Why would lawmakers try to sneak a 10-year ban on AI regulation into a budget bill?
No surprise, it’s money.
There’s big money in Big Tech. The draft moratorium is the result of aggressive lobbying from companies that are already using AI to undermine workers and eliminate jobs.
To understand what a ban on AI regulation could mean, ask yourself: what are lawmakers talking about when they talk about ""AI?""
Most of us imagine programs like ChatGPT churning out text and images. But Big Tech sees something else: disruption, control, profit.
They want driverless trucks crisscrossing our roads without oversight. Delivery drones flying over our neighborhoods without regulation. Fully automated warehouses and ports operated by machine. Freight moving across state lines without a single worker involved — and without anyone paying attention.
They want a world with fewer workers, fewer rules, and zero interference from state or local governments.

It’s not justblue-collar jobson the line. AI is already being used to automate white-collar work in finance, law, media, and design. Bad actors are using AI tools to create deepfake videos, clone voices, spread hate, and commit fraud. These tools are being abused now, and without strong public oversight, the risks will get worse.
But some states are stepping up. Lawmakers in both parties have introduced bills to locally regulate AI surveillance, driverless vehicles, and workplace automation. And that’s precisely why Big Tech wants to nuke states’ rights to regulation as quickly as possible.
HUMANOID ROBOTS HANDLE QUALITY CHECKS AND ASSEMBLY AT AUTO PLANT
If the moratorium language stays in the reconciliation bill and this ban goes through, it will be one of the largest federal takeovers of state power in U.S. history. It would strip all 50 states of their right to protect jobs, police their streets, ensure public safety, and respond to a technology that’s changing by the minute.
It will send our country into a spiral from which we cannot recover. It will lead to a future where states are forced to sacrifice their sovereignty to any special interest with enough money to spend.

This isn’t policy. It’s a payoff. It’s a decade-long free pass for tech giants to kill jobs, silence state governments, and reshape the country to their liking behind closed doors. No accountability. Just profits for the people who need it least.
You can’t say you support working people and then vote to replace us with machines. You can’t claim to believe in states’ rights and then give Silicon Valley total control over how America works.

When politicians sell out, it’s always workers who pay the price. But senators still have a choice. They can fix this situation and improve the bill. They can protect hardworking families — or they can side with Big Tech and cast American workers aside.

Voters are feeling a bit better about the economy, yet overall sentiment remains negative.
Since the start ofPresident Donald Trump’ssecond term, positive ratings of the economy have inched up from 21% in March to 28% in April to 31% in the latest Fox News survey, which is about where things stood at the end of the Biden administration in January. During the previous four years, that number was higher than the current rating only once, when it hit 32% in June 2024. For reference, at the end of the first Trump administration, 33% gave economic conditions positive marks (December 2020), but that had been as high as 55% in January 2020 (just before the pandemic).
Currently, 62% say their family is getting ahead (14%) or holding steady financially (48%), up 5 points since January. The 36% who say they are falling behind is the lowest in four years.
FOX NEWS POLL: THE FIRST 100 DAYS OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S SECOND TERM
Still,economicsentiment is mostly gloomy: 84% are extremely or very concerned about inflation, 68% score conditions as only fair or poor, and 55% feel pessimistic about the economy.
Democrats, Independents, women, and voters without a college degree are among those most likely to say the economy is in bad shape, while Republicans, men, and college graduates are among those most likely to rate it better.
FOX NEWS POLL: DEMOCRATS' FAVORABILITY HITS NEW LOW, STILL FAVORED OVER GOP IN 2026 MIDTERMS
""During theBidenyears, Republicans and independents were overwhelmingly negative about the economy, while Democrats were slightly less so,"" says Republican pollster Daron Shaw, who helps run the Fox News survey with Democrat Chris Anderson. ""Now with Trump as president, Democrats think the sky is falling, while Republicans see rays of sunlight.""
By a 21-point margin, voters oppose the federal budget legislation passed by the House of Representatives that the president calls the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" (38% favor vs. 59% oppose). About half think the bill would hurt their family (49%), while one quarter think it would help (23%), and another quarter don’t think it would make a difference (26%).
Sixty percent feel they have a good understanding of what is in the OBBB, and while those voters are more likely to favor the legislation than those who are unfamiliar with it, more still think it will hurt rather than help their family (45% vs. 34%).
Views of the legislation are highly partisan, withRepublicansfavoring it (73%), and Democrats (89%) and Independents (73%) opposed. Fewer than half of Republicans think it will help their family (46%).
Overall, 57% think tariffs hurt the economy, the highest ever recorded in Fox News surveys -- and double the number who think tariffs help.
While a majority (53%) approve of Trump’s handling of border security (46% disapprove), the president otherwise receives negative marks on the issues: immigration (46% approve, 53% disapprove), and foreign policy (42-57%). His worst ratings are on the economy (40-58%) and inflation (34-64%), where he’s underwater by a whopping 30 points.
The president’s overall job approval stands at 46%, while 54% disapprove. That’s up a couple ticks from 44-55% in April. His highest approval, 49%, came in March 2025 and April 2020. Men under age 45 (55% approve) and White men without a college degree (54% approve) are among those giving the president his best marks. Seven in 10 Republicans consider themselves part of the MAGA movement, and fully 98% of them approve.
About 90% ofDemocratsdisapprove of the job Trump is doing generally and on specific issues, with the exception of border security, where fewer disapprove (80%). Most Republicans are with Trump, but approval drops to 68% on inflation and 75% on the economy, generally. Disapproval among Independents ranges from roughly half on border security to three-quarters on inflation.
When voters are asked how they feel about Trump as a person, his ratings are underwater by 10 points: 45% have a favorable opinion and 55% an unfavorable view. For comparison, that’s about on par with JD Vance (44- 53%), Joe Biden (43-56%), and Marco Rubio (42-46%), and ahead of Elon Musk (41-58%), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (40-45%), Gavin Newsom (39-45%), and Pete Hegseth (32-45%), while his ratings trail those of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. (48-50%) and Kamala Harris (49-51%). Harris’s higher favorability comes from more Democrats (87%) and Independents (38%) viewing her positively compared to favorable views of Trump among Republicans (85%) and Independents (34%).
None of those tested – not the president, not the vice president and not the former president nor the former vice president -- garnered positive marks from at least 50% of voters, although Harris comes closest.
As mentioned above, most are concerned about inflation (84%), including 78% of Republicans.
By a single point, the future of the U.S. narrowly tops inflation as voters’ top concern, with 85% saying they’re worried about the direction of the country. That includes 8 in 10 Republicans, and 9 in 10 Democrats and Independents.
Eight in 10 voters are concerned about government spending and Iran getting a nuclear weapon, while around 7 in 10 are worried about antisemitism, illegal immigration, and the use of the U.S. military domestically, and roughly 6 in 10 about protests in U.S. cities.
More Democrats (87%) and Independents (71%) express concern about the deployment of federal troops in cities in response to anti-ICE protests than Republicans (42%). On the other hand, more Republicans (84%) are worried about illegal immigration than Independents (68%) and Democrats (49%).
There are zero issues that all three groups, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents, agree on as priorities. The top three concerns for Democrats are the future of the U.S., inflation, and U.S. troops being deployed, while for Republicans, it’s illegal immigration, Iran getting nukes, and government spending.  Among Independents, it’s the future of the country, inflation, and government spending.

MARSHALL, NC –Nearly nine months have passed sinceHurricane Helenemade its way through Western North Carolina, washing out homes and businesses.
In the small mountain town of Marshall, just 30 minutes north of Asheville, business owners are eager for visitors. The main town sits along the French Broad River, which rose nearly 25 feet during Helene's storms, calculated by the U.S. Geological Survey.
The townreopened to visitorsin May and each week more businesses are opening their doors. Some business owners still remember the layer of mud caked on the floor, covering their belongings like a blanket.
""I had no words, I mean I was crying,"" said Connie Molland, co-founder of Flow Gallery. ""To walk into this space and see what we had left was all toppled all over and covered in mud.""
POPULAR NORTH CAROLINA DESTINATIONS STILL RECOVERING FROM HELENE
Molland said before the storm she tried to gather as much of the handcrafted art as she could. The gallery lost about 30% of itsartwork from Helene.
The gallery was not the only business crushed under Helene's wrath.
Many businesses have reported a thick layer of mud covering the floor of their establishment.
Zuma's Coffee owner, Joel Friedman, says he had to climb through his windows just to get inside his coffee shop.
""All these windows busted out, all the contents went out with it. All the tables, chairs, the equipment. It was total destruction,"" he told Fox News.
Over eight inches of mud filled her gallery after Helene, said co-founder Connie Molland.
Friedman and Molland said volunteers from all over the country showed up on their doorstep — wearing protective gear, carrying tools, and ready to work.

https://www.foxnews.com/health/brain-physically-changes-when-work-too-much-scientists-warn,"Your brain physically changes when you work too much, scientists warn","Dr. Paul Saphier, M.D., a New Jersey neurosurgeon, shared in a video posted to X what he's eating for breakfast to maximize the brain health benefits.
New research has found that being overworked can physicallyalter the brain.
Researchers in South Korea set out to understand how working long hours impact the cognitive and emotional health of employees.
The study, published in the journal Occupational & Environmental Medicine, assessed the brain volume of 110 healthcare workers who were classified by the categories of overworked – working greater than or equal to 52 hours per week – and non-overworked.
LOW-CALORIE DIETS LINKED TO SURPRISING MENTAL HEALTH EFFECT, NEW RESEARCH SHOWS
The results revealed that overworked individuals exhibited ""significant changes"" in brain regions that are associated with executive function and emotional regulation.
Study co-author Wanhyung Lee, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor at Chung-Ang University College of Medicine in Seoul, told Fox News Digital that this is one of the first studies to examine the relationship between prolonged working hours and structural brain changes.
New research has shown that overworked individuals exhibited ""significant changes"" in key brain regions.(iStock)
""We initially had no clear expectations regarding what we might discover,"" he revealed. ""Therefore, we found the results particularly intriguing.""
The researchernoted that increased brain volume associated with cognitive and emotional functions was an ""unexpected and fascinating"" observation of the study.
""These findings open new questions and underscore the complexity of how chronic occupational stress might affect brain health, highlighting the need for further detailed investigations,"" he said.
‘I’M A NEUROSURGEON – THIS IS WHAT I EAT FOR A BRAIN-HEALTHY BREAKFAST'
The increased brain volume as observed was found in regions associated with executive functions, Lee said, such as memory, decision-making and attention — as well asemotional regulation, such as stress management and emotional stability.
While these changes may initially reflect a need to manage ""ongoing occupational stress,"" according to Lee, there could be potential risks of prolonged or chronic alterations.
This could include neural strain, inflammation or maladaptive reorganization.
Working long hours could potentially have a long-term impact on brain function, a study co-author and professor (not pictured) has suggested.(iStock)
""Although our current study cannot conclusively determine the long-term impacts, ongoing exposure without sufficient recovery may negatively affect cognitive and emotional health,"" he said.
Lee urged employees who work excessive hours torecognize that chronic stresscan lead to physical brain changes, not just psychological complications. This emphasizes the need to manage workload, prioritize rest and maintain emotional balance.
""At the same time, individual efforts alone are not sufficient; organizational support and proactive management by companies to create healthy working conditions are essential to protect employees’ brain health,"" he said.
NEGATIVE THOUGHTS MIGHT BE CHANGING YOUR BRAIN IN SURPRISING WAYS, STUDY SUGGESTS
""With the rapid advancement ofsmartphones and digital technology, work increasingly extends beyond traditional office hours into personal time, making chronic overwork more common and less visible,"" Lee went on. ""Employers and policymakers must also acknowledge and address these evolving work patterns to support sustainable working environments.""
The researcher recognized the progressive move toward becoming an ""overwork society."" He urged employees to ""actively set boundaries, ensure regular rest and recovery, practice stress management, and advocate for workplace policies that clearly define and respect healthy work-hour limits.""
There's ""no question"" too much mental stress can alter the brain, said a neurosurgeon.(iStock)
Dr. Paul Saphier, a neurosurgeon and founder of Coaxial Neurosurgical Specialists in New Jersey, was not involved in the study but commented on the findings in an interview with Fox News Digital.
Saphier considered the study interesting, yet not ""overly surprising.""

""There is no question that mental stress and fatigue, eitherwith sleep deprivation, anxiety, long periods of intense concentration, etc., lead to alteration of neurotransmitter release and additional physiological changes,"" he said. ""This may ultimately lead to anatomical changes within the brain.""
Experts have known that professions that require ""crisp cognitive awareness"" with ""zero room for error"" — such asairline pilotsand medical professionals — benefit from ""limited consecutive work hours to reduce errors,"" said the neurosurgeon.
""Caring for your mental health and well-being is essential if you want to be a productive employee,"" one career expert said.(iStock)
Kyle Elliott, a California-based tech career coach and mental health expert, also weighed in during a separate interview with Fox News Digital.
""Caring for your mental health and well-being is essential if you want to be a productive employee,"" he said.
""Neglecting your mental health can not only affect your ability to work effectively but also negatively impact your physical health and longevity.""

Elliot encouraged employees to advocate for their needs.
""Don't be afraid to speak up [at work or to employers] if you need to take a break or time off to protect your mental or physical health,"" he said. ""Yourmind and bodywill thank you in the long run.""

In April, PresidentDonald Trumpfollowed through on a campaign promise andimplemented tariffson the majority of the United States’ trading partners. Predictably, the left lost their collective minds and giddily spoke of the coming collapse of the American economy, higher inflation and massive unemployment.
Perhaps no one on the left stoked fear more than the Democrat senator from Hawaii, Brian Schatz. Schatz lamented that, ""Donald Trump is ruining the economy on purpose … we'll be paying more for everything – groceries, food, cars, homes, toys, electronics, everything that you buy. This is about the ability for people to pay for college. This is about the ability for people to retire with dignity and comfort. Trillions of dollars of wealth are being demolished. These are everyday people panicked about how much more expensive their next trip to Walmart or Costco will be, or when they'll lose their job.""
Schatz may be a liberal senator from the Rainbow state, but he is apparently no Nostradamus. The American economy is doing quite well and shows no signs of slowing down.
US IS IN A ‘SUPER PLACE,’ SAYS COMMERCE SECRETARY ON CHINA TRADE TALKS
The United States added nearly 140,000 new jobs in May 2025, beating forecasts and the unemployment rate remained at 4.2%. Since February 2025, the first full month of Trump’s second term, the United States has added more than 515,000 jobs, despite shrinking the size of the Federal Government.

Inflation remains low as well.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI),a measure of inflation,was 2.4% for the 12 months ending in May 2025, slightly up from the 2.3% number in April. Core inflation was at 2.8% for the third straight months, growing at the slowest pace since inflation surged in the spring of 2021.
TRUMP SUPPORTERS FEAR $36T DEBT YET BACK PRESIDENT'S AGENDA
Inflation was held down by declines in airfare, new and used cars, clothing and energy costs.
The positive job news and low inflation have caused consumer confidence to surge.
Consumer confidence rose 12.3 points in May to a reading of 98, the Conference Board said in its latest survey, the first monthly gain since November and the biggest monthly increase since March 2021. The reading of 98 was significantly higher than economists’ prediction of 88.
And it isn’t just consumer confidence that is improving.Small business confidenceis also on the rise.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-trump-deduction-a-simpler-path-to-tax-free-tips-and-overtime,The Trump Deduction: A simpler path to tax-free tips and overtime,"White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt addresses the media after President Donald Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill’ was passed by the House.
The current version of PresidentDonald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act delivers on one of his core campaign promises – exempting tips and overtime pay from federal taxation.
But he could score a victory on this promise in a more beautiful way by creating a new ""Trump Tips and Overtime Deduction"" that would be available exclusively to workers who receive tips or overtime pay.
Tax-free tips and overtime are politically popular, but messy and problematic in almost every other way imaginable.

They are exceedingly complicated from an administrative perspective, as employers and employees will undoubtedly go to great lengths to reclassify earnings as tipped or overtime pay. This is going to create a nightmare for the IRS, which is already one of the most incompetent agencies in the federal government.
TAX-FREE OVERTIME COULD BE MIDTERM MAGIC FOR GOP
On top of that, these are budget-busting policies at a time of nearly unprecedented levels of red ink. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, ""no tax on tips"" and ""no tax on overtime"" are scored at a combined $164 billion over 10 years; however, that number is somewhat misleading as the policies are scheduled to be in place for only four years. If they are extended across the 10-year window – which is very likely – they could easily reduce revenue collections by half a trillion dollars.
That’s an enormous amount of revenue, especially considering that these policies are not likely to generate substantial economic growth or job creation. These resources would be better utilized reducing our massive federal debt or enacting across-the-board, pro-growth tax policy.
The ""Trump Tips and Overtime Deduction"" is a much better way to give President Trump a resounding win on one of his campaign promises. This ingenious policy would not only provide much-needed relief to working-class Americans, it would also do so without overcomplicating the tax code or heaping enormous amounts of additional debt on future generations.
The Trump deduction is simple. It is a bonus deduction of $1,000available to all workerswho are eligible for overtime or who work in positions that customarily receive tips. That’s it. There would be no added complexity involved while completing your taxes and no need to quantify what income is derived from overtime or tips versus via wages. You wouldn’t even need to demonstrate that you earned $1,000 or more in eligible pay. If you meet the requirements for the Trump Deduction, you simply check a box on your tax form and collect the extra $1,000 deduction.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
With 6 million taxpayers reporting tip income and 80 million working hourly and eligible for overtime, an enhanced standard deduction would be a tax cut of around $13 billion a year, compared to the more complicated $45 billion a year currently projected.
The mechanics for the federal government are also pretty straightforward. As with the current legislative text of the current ""big, beautiful bill,"" the Treasury secretary would publish a list of traditionally tipped occupations. If you work in one of these categories, you check a box on your tax form.
Workers who are nonexempt under the Fair Labor Standards Act – that includes most full-time workers who make $35,568 or less – can check the corresponding box on their tax forms.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
If either box is checked, you get the Trump Deduction. It’s a simple, beautiful way to deliver pro-worker tax relief without complicating the tax code or busting the budget.
But perhaps most importantly, it provides ahuge win for Trumpand his campaign promise to end taxes on tips and overtime pay.

Well— the Washington Post sure hasn’t…
The National Labor Relations Board is seeking reinstatement and back pay for former Washington Post reporterFelicia Sonmez, who was fired in 2022 after attacking colleagues and fiercely criticizing the paper on social media.
Sonmez was terminated for insubordination after she continued condemning other Post reporters online despite multiple memos issued by then-executive editor Sally Buzbee calling for civility. The Washington-Baltimore News Guild filed an unfair labor practice charge over Sonmez's firing. The NLRB, Guild and Washington Post each filed briefs on Friday.
""To put it bluntly, Respondent just got sick of Sonmez’s Twitter activity criticizing the Post’s and its policies, as well as its implementation—or lack thereof—of those policies. In response, Respondent decided to bypass its progressive discipline system and fire her because of those criticisms,"" NLRB prosecutors said.

When asking for the complaint to be dismissed, the Post argued that allowing Sonmez to return to the company ""would cause unmanageable and unacceptable disruption,"" and referred to the actions that resulted in her dismissal as a ""seven-day tirade.""
""Because Sonmez lacks the ‘journalistic integrity’ necessary to work in the Post’s newsroom, she should not be reinstated,"" the Post argued.
The Guild believes the Post violated her rights under the National Labor Relations Act.
The saga began in June 2022 when Sonmez went after then-colleague Dave Weigel for retweeting a joke: ""Every girl is bi. You just have to figure out if it's polar or sexual.""
Sonmez was not amused and publicly criticized her colleague, also attacking her workplace by reacting, ""Fantastic to work at a news outlet where retweets like this are allowed!""
Sonmez then launched a days-long public tirade against the Post and many of her colleagues.

Weigel was placed on a one-month unpaid suspension despite having removed the retweet and issuing an apology. He left the Post to join the start-up site Semafor later that year.
However, Sonmez's tweetstorms berating co-workers continued, and she began receiving public pushback from Post colleagues, who Sonmez then attacked publicly.
She repeatedly ripped the paper’s social media policy throughout the ordeal. Sonmez even took aim at ""White"" reporters who expressed solidarity with the paper amid infighting.
""I don’t know who the colleagues anonymously disparaging me in media reports are. But I do know that the reporters who issued synchronized tweets this week downplaying the Post’s workplace issues have a few things in common with each other,"" Sonmez wrote during a lengthy Twitter thread, saying they ""are all White.""

NLRB prosecutors are seeking reinstatement and back pay for Sonmez, who now works for Blue Ridge Public Radio. Sonmez declined comment.
""The decision is now up to the judge,"" Sonmez wrote on X.

California labor leaderDavid Huerta, 58, was released from federal custody on Monday on a $50,000 bond after being charged with ""conspiracy to impede an officer.""
Huerta, the president of Service Employees International Union California (SEIU), was arrested during an anti-ICE protest in Los Angeles on Friday.
Huerta was photographed wearing socks and carrying shoes following his release from custody. He told reporters he did not intend to get arrested, and the only way to win change is through nonviolence.

Huerta was arrested whilelaw enforcement officerswere executing a federal search warrant at a Los Angeles business suspected of hiring illegal immigrants and falsifying employment papers, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, which is part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, wrote in a federal court filing obtained by the AP.
SEIU represents 750,000 members in 17local unionsacross 58 counties, according to its website. Among the members are ""nurses, healthcare workers, janitors, social workers, security officers, in-home caregivers, school and university employees, court workers, and city, county and state employees.""

While SEIU International President April Verrett said on Monday that the labor union is ""relieved"" that Huerta is free, she added his arrest only drew attention to a larger issue.
""Thousands of workers remain unjustly detained and separated from their families. At this very moment, immigrant communities are being terrorized by heavily militarized armed forces. The Trump regime calling in the National Guard is a dangerous escalation to target people who disagree with them. It is a threat to our democracy. The federal government should never be used as a weapon against people who disagree with them,"" she said in a statement.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/lee-zeldin-start-your-rigs-alaska-our-gateway-energy-dominance,LEE ZELDIN: Start your rigs: Alaska is our 'Gateway to Energy Dominance',"Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin details the agency's goal to be as efficient 'as possible,' its approach to staffing and its projects with other departments and agencies.
Alaska stands as anAmerican energy powerhouse, a vital gateway to energy dominance, economic prosperity and national security.
The 49th state holds half of U.S. coal resources, the country’s fourth-largest proved crude oil reserves, and the second-largest proved natural gas reserves behind Texas.
On his first day in office, PresidentDonald Trumprecognized these untapped opportunities and issued an important executive order, Unleashing Alaska’s Extraordinary Resource Potential.

He declared that developing Alaska’s energy resources would help deliver price relief for Americans and create high-quality jobs for our citizens while resolving trade imbalances and bolstering the nation’s exercise of global energy dominance.
ONE STATE’S NATURAL RESOURCES CAN FINALLY PUT AN END TO AMERICA’S RELIANCE ON CHINA
America should not have to rely on foreign energy sources to fuel our cars and heat our homes. It’s expensive, and those countries end up with leverage over the United States.
Anyone who lived through the 1973 Arab oil embargo marked by long gasoline lines and fuel shortages understands this vulnerability.
Producing more of our resources – oil, gas, coal – at home lowers the price of energy used for electricity and transportation fuel, which helps bring more affordable goods and services to Americans.
President Trump’s EO ended the assault onAlaska’s sovereigntyand its ability to responsibly develop these resources for the benefit of the nation. He reversed punitive restrictions implemented by the previous administration that prevented the U.S. from producing American energy on both state and federal lands in Alaska, which can now help spark an energy and economic revival.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS PURSUING ENERGY DOMINANCE — CONGRESS SHOULDN'T GET IN THE WAY
All of this settled in as I traversed the great state of Alaska last week with Interior SecretaryDoug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, Sen. Dan Sullivan and the state’s governor, Mike Dunleavy.
From the Arctic Coastal Plain to the North Slope, the potential held within Alaska’s bastion of natural resources was clear.
The U.S. Geological Survey says Alaska has at least 160 billion short tons, and possibly up to 5.5 trillion short tons. Yet only one surface coal mine – the Usibelli mine – is operational, supplying about 1.2 million tons annually to neighboring states and Asian allies.
Coal mines also contain critical minerals required for our modern life, a reality unearthed by President Trump during his first term. He has already taken steps to expand sourcing critical minerals for national security.
MY FAMILY TRIED LIVING EUROPEAN-STYLE AUSTERITY. ONE STATE'S INSANE ENERGY AGENDA WANTS THAT AS A MODEL
Alaska is rich in critical minerals including graphite, lithium, tin, tungsten, rare earth elements and platinum-group elements – essential to everyday products Americans demand. Flake graphite, a major component in lithium-ion battery anodes, is currently 100% imported, but Alaska could provide domestic supply.
The state is also an oil and gas titan, yet most of the natural gas produced is not brought to market because of lack of pipeline infrastructure.
During President Trump’s first term, the oil and gas industry in Alaska supported47,300 total jobs, provided $4.6 billion in labor income to Alaska and contributed $19.4 billion to Alaska’s total gross domestic product, which was more than 35% of the state’s total GDP.
By contrast, the previous administration all but ended oil and gas drilling on the North Slope and canceled the seven remaining leases for drilling on the coastal plains, sacrificing economic growth, energy security, affordable reliable power generation and prosperity for all Alaskans.
AMERICA'S ENERGY CRISIS IS HIDING IN PLAIN SIGHT AND IT'S WORSE THAN YOU KNOW
President Trump’s vision for us to unleash oil, gas, coal and even critical minerals in Alaska could generate billions of dollars in revenue and thousands of high-paying jobs.
Producing this bounty would set us on a path to fulfill President Trump’s vision forU.S. energy dominance.
We can’t afford not to produce Alaskan energy.
I was fortunate to visit with the Chenega Regional Development Group, LLC and native Alaskans of the Chenega tribe on this trip. What struck me was their kindness, resilience and openness to energy development in their state.
While more than half of Alaskans live in Anchorage, Juneau or Fairbanks, most native Alaskans don’t – they inhabit much of the northern and southwestern regions.

Native Inupiat Eskimos in Northern Alaska have said they do not want to be suspended in the 19th century, and most of the 20th when they struggled with no electricity, running water, toilets or sewage management.
They have struggled to stay warm, and in many cases, have nearly died from hypothermia when they lived without adequate energy and home heating.
All Americans must have access to adequate electricity and home heating. Climate activism cannot stand in the way of access to critical energy resources.

Voters in red areas of the country are ringing alarm bells over the country’s national debt just as PresidentDonald Trumpwants Congress to pass a bill experts say will add trillions to it over the next few years.
Fox News Digital spoke to voters in Trump voting districts throughout the United States to gauge how they feel about the U.S. national debt. Most of them said that it was a significant cause for concern, and some even called out the president they support for adding to it.
""We need to address the national debt, and I thought that Trump was doing that when he brought in [Elon] Musk. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Trump supporter. But I think his spending's gotten a little bit out of control,"" Art, in Lapeer, Michigan, told Fox.

The national debt currently sits at$36.2 trillionand counting, according to Fox Business' National Debt Tracker. A new spending bill – dubbed the ""big, beautiful bill"" by Trump – has reinvigorated concern over how much higher the debt, with its implications for economic growth and future spending, can get.
The sweeping tax cuts and spending package, passed by the GOP-controlled House in May, addresses many of the president’s legislative priorities on cutting taxes, boosting border security, American energy, defense, and rolling back some of former President Joe Biden’s environmental regulations and tax credits.
However, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected the legislation would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt, prompting criticism from even Trump allies like Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla.
Former Department of Government Efficiency headElon Muskeven publicly feuded with the president over the bill last week, in a spat that played out on social media.

Ahead of the upcoming Senate vote on passing the bill, Fox News Digital asked voters in Republican voting precincts about the national debt, and many responded they had serious reservations.
A woman in Staten Island, New York, who asked to remain anonymous, told Fox, ""It’s too big. And we’re leaving it for the future, for our children, and we’re leaving all that debt on them to pay for. I don’t think that’s right.""
""We can’t keep spending ourselves into the ground and leaving that burden for our children and grandchildren,"" Franceen in Boca Raton, Florida, declared.
Chris from Cypress, Texas said, ""I mean, I'm inheriting it, my kids are inheriting it, and we've got to cut it off, or we're going to default.""
Front Royal, Virginia, resident Frank told Fox that the debt has been a ""longstanding problem.""
""It’s probably going to be there even after I’m gone, but yeah, of course, any country has a problem with their debt. Of course, it’s a problem,"" he said.

Joe in Lapeer said, ""Yes, I think it is an issue. So, at this time, I think it’s going to level out over time. It can't keep going the way it was going, put it that way. You know, that's my opinion.""
A man from Staten Island, who asked to remain anonymous, acknowledged the problem but expressed hope that Trump will try to right the ship.
""I think it's always a problem,"" he said. ""I think the other party was just – made everything upside down and now Trump's trying to fix it. So, it's going to take a few years, but I think we're on the right track.""
""It is a huge problem,"" Chad in Cypress, Texas, declared. ""You know, we’ve got to the point right now – I think we're $34, $36 trillion in debt. And it's like running up a credit card, you know, sooner or later the bill has to be paid and there's no reason for America to be in debt.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/federal-ai-power-grab-could-end-state-protections-kids-workers,Federal AI power grab could end state protections for kids and workers,"Gladstone A.I. co-founders and CEOs Edouard Harris and Jeremie Harris explain the major role that A.I will play in national security and warfare on ‘The Will Cain Show.’
Just asAI begins to upendAmerican society, Congress is considering a move that would sideline states from enforcing commonsense safeguards.
Tucked into the recently passed House reconciliation package is Section 43201, a provision that would pre-empt nearly all state and local laws governing ""artificial intelligence models,"" ""artificial intelligence systems,"" and ""automated decision systems"" for the next 10 years.
Last night, the Senate released its own version of the moratorium that would restrict states from receiving federal funding for broadband infrastructure if they don’t fall in line.
Supporters argue that a moratorium is needed to avoid a patchwork of state rules that could jeopardize U.S. AI competitiveness.
AI'S DEVELOPMENT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR AMERICA – AND IT ALL HINGES ON THESE FREEDOMS
But this sweeping approach threatens to override legitimate state efforts to curb Big Tech’s worst abuses—with no federal safeguards to replace them. It also risks undermining the constitutional role of state legislatures to protect the interests and rights of American children and working families amid AI’s far-reaching social and economic disruptions.
In the absence of Congressional action, states have been the first line of defense againstBig Tech. Texas, Florida, Utah, and other states have led the way to protect children online, safeguard data privacy, and rein in platform censorship.
Section 43201 puts many of those laws—even those not directly related to AI—at risk.
The provision defines ""automated decision systems"" broadly, potentially capturing core functions of social media platforms, such as TikTok’s For You feed or Instagram’s recommendation engine.
At least 12 states have enacted laws requiring parental consent or age verification for minors accessing these platforms. However, because these laws specifically apply to social media platforms, they could easily be construed as regulating ""automated decision systems""— and thus be swept up in the moratorium.
Further, Section 43201 might also block provisions of existing state privacy laws that restrict the use of algorithms—including AI—to predict consumer behavior, preferences, or characteristics.
Even setting aside concerns with the moratorium’s expansive scope, it suffers from a more fundamental flaw.
The moratorium threatens to short-circuit American federalism by undermining state laws that ensure AI lives up to the promise outlined by Vice PresidentJ.D. Vance.
Speaking at the Paris AI Summit, he warned against viewing ""AI as a purely disruptive technology that will inevitably automate away our labor force.""
Instead,Vance called for""policies that ensure that AI… make[s] our workers more productive"" and rewards them with ""higher wages, better benefits, and safer and more prosperous communities.""
That vision is nearly impossible without state-level action. Legislators, governors, and attorneys general from Nashville to Salt Lake City are already advancing creative, democratically accountable solutions.
Tennessee’s novel ELVIS Act protects music artists from nonconsensual AI-generated voice and likeness cloning. Utah’s AI consumer protection law requires that generative AI model deployers notify consumers when they are interacting with an AI.
Other states, including Arkansas and Montana, are building legal frameworks for digital property rights with respect to AI models, algorithms, data, and model outputs.
All of this is now at risk.
As laboratories of democracy, states are essential to navigating the inevitable and innumerable trade-offs entailed by the diffusion ofemerging technologies. Federalism enables continuous experimentation and competition between states—exposing the best and worst approaches to regulation in highly dynamic environments.
That’s critical when confronting AI’s vast and constantly evolving sphere of impact on children and employment—to say nothing of the technology’s wider socio-economic effects.
Sixty leading advocacy and research organizations have warned thatAI chatbotspose a significant threat to kids. They cite harrowing stories of teens who have been induced to suicide, addiction, sexual perversion, and self-harm at the hands of Big AI.
Even industry leaders are sounding alarms: Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei estimates that AI could force up to 20% unemployment over the next five years.

Innovation inherently brings disruption—but disruption without guardrails can harm the very communities AI is purportedly meant to uplift. That’s why 40 state attorneys general, Democrats and Republicans alike, signed a letter opposing Section 43201, warning that it would override ""carefully tailored laws targeting specific harms related to the use of AI.""
To be sure, not all laws are drafted equal. States like California and Colorado are imposing European-style AI regulations particularly detrimental to ""Little Tech"" and open-source model developers.
But Congress shouldn’t throw out federalism with the ""doomer"" bathwater. Rather than a blanket pre-emption, it should consider narrow, targeted limits carefully tailored to stymie high-risk bills—modeled on California and Colorado’s approach—that foist doomer AI standards on the rest of the nation.

Absent a comprehensive federal AI framework, states must retain freedom to act—specifically, to ensure that AI bolsters American innovation and competitiveness in pursuit of a thriving middle class.
America’s AI future has great potential. But our laboratories of democracy are key to securing it.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-trumps-3-billion-wake-up-call-higher-ed-exactly-what-america-needs,Why Trump’s $3 billion wake-up call to higher ed is exactly what America needs,"People in Washington D.C., Detroit, MI and Houston, TX react to President Trump pulling Harvard University funding and his proposal to shuffle the cut finances to trade schools.
When PresidentDonald Trumprecently suggested taking $3 billion from Harvard’s federal funding and redirecting it toward trade schools, he didn’t just launch a headline, he launched a national reckoning. And as a university president, I believe he touched a nerve that desperately needed to be hit.
For too long, higher education has drifted from its purpose.Elite institutionshave grown wealthier and more disconnected, while everyday Americans shoulder massive student debt for degrees that no longer guarantee opportunity.
The result? A broken pipeline, rising costs, shrinking returns, and students who feel forced to choose between meaning and mobility.

But here’s the truth few are willing to say out loud: not every student is called to a traditional university path. And that’s not a problem to fix, it’s a reality to embrace.
HARVARD VS. TRUMP: ALL THE PRESIDENT WANTS IS FOR THE UNIVERSITY TO OBEY THE LAW
In my role, I’ve seen firsthand the power ofaligning education with calling. That includes aspiring teachers, ministers and entrepreneurs, but also electricians, HVAC technicians, mechanics and builders.
I’ve met students who feel more alive on a construction site than in a lecture hall. And I’ve seen how learning construction technology can do more than build a career, it can restore confidence, dignity and purpose.
This is personal for me. I lead a university, yes, but I also lead with the conviction that education should serve the whole person: spiritually, practically and vocationally. That’s why I believe the future of higher ed must includethe trades, not as a fallback, but as a foundation.

Christian tradition understands this well. Jesus worked with wood and nails before preaching in synagogues. Paul made tents to support his ministry. Scripture doesn’t draw a line between spiritual work and skilled labor. It lifts both as sacred. As Paul writes in 1 Thessalonians 4:11, ""Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life… and to work with your hands.""
What we need now is a cultural reset. One that stops looking down on trades and starts investing in them, not just with funding, but with respect. That means parents affirming their child’s calling, even if it leads to a job site instead of a boardroom. It means pastors reminding their congregations that all honest work is sacred. And it means more universities embracing flexible, high-quality training that equips students for lives of both character and competence.
The goal isn’t to pit trade schools againsttraditional universities. It’s to restore balance. Because the future of our country won’t be built from ivory towers. It will be built from the ground up, by people with tools in their hands and purpose in their hearts.

Loyal customers accuse iconic dessert chain of 'shrinkflation',"Food stylist and cookbook author Suzanne Lenzer joins the ‘Fox & Friends Weekend’ crew to show off some of her top healthy recipes for summer.
One of America's most popularrestaurant chainshas been accused of ""shrinkflation"" by some of its most loyal customers.
The Cheesecake Factory, famous for its large portion sizes, has 200-plus locations across the United States. The chain is well-known for having an expansive, calorie-packed menu of over 250 items across various cuisines.
But the restaurant is now being accused of shrinkflation, which is when companies make products smaller while keeping prices the same or raising them.
DO YOU SPEND MORE AT FAST-FOOD RESTAURANTS THAN YOU WANT TO? CONSIDER THIS
Members of a Cheesecake Factory Reddit group, a community of 4,000cheesecake enthusiasts,recently discussed the chain's allegedly dwindling portion sizes.
In one post, a skeptical customer shared a picture of a cheesecake slice in a to-go box.

The user's concerns were validated by most commenters, who overwhelmingly concluded that they, too, noticed smaller slices.
""The cheesecakes used to have 8 slices in each,"" one Redditor claimed. ""Now it's 12 slices for each.""
""And of course the price has only gone up,"" another commenter replied.
""If memory serves, I think the slices got smaller years ago,"" one Redditor said.
Another recalled, ""Yes!! A month ago, I was SHOCKED at the size of the to-go slices we were handed at the counter.""

Climate change advocates are using ""tiny jurisdictions"" across the country to push their priorities through civil lawsuits, in an effort that could have significant national-level impacts on domestic oil production and even other industries, a conservative consumer advocate warns.
PresidentDonald Trumphas taken steps to unleash a sweeping domestic energy agenda, including through preemptive lawsuits in at least four states aimed at preventing them from suing fossil fuel companies over climate change damages. However, a wave of other mainly Democratic jurisdictions across the country, such as in Oregon, Colorado and Washington, are still attempting to go after fossil fuel companies, something consumer advocate O.H.

""You really have to understand that these suits matter a ton,"" said Skinner, who is a fossil fuel industry advocate and executive director at nonprofit Alliance for Consumers. ""If a court in Oregon declares climate change to be a public nuisance, and orders the nine biggest energy companies in America to stop the nuisance, they're going to unlock billions of dollars for their green initiatives, and going to be asking the court to prevent theseenergy companiesfrom opening a new oil field, drilling, producing, refining, everywhere.""

He also pointed out that several other ""public nuisance lawsuits"" across the country ""are asking for national fixes from courtrooms in little, tiny jurisdictions.""
""One county gets 50 billion. Another county gets 50 billion. What's their real goal? Bankrupting the energy industry across the whole country,"" Skinner said. ""If they were to get such a win, it would start to have a huge effect.""
Trump signed an executive order in April targeting state and local lawsuits against domestic energy producers, which, in part, instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify and take action against state laws and civil actions that burden domestic energy producers. So far, his administration has filedlawsuits against at least four states,New York, Vermont, Michigan and Hawaii, to block them from suing fossil fuel companies for damages.

""They are trying to direct national policy through the courtroom, because they've lost in so many other important venues,like Congressor at the ballot box for president,"" Skinner said.

""Allowing that tax to lapse in 2026 would cost the corporate fund an estimated $80 million next year alone, further exacerbating our $1 billion-plus gap,"" Guzman said. ""Nearly 200 other municipalities in Illinois — from Berwyn to Wheaton and beyond — have already voted to extend this grocery tax... If we fail to do the same, we will leave critical services on the chopping block.""
She pointed to the city's police department as a potential victim of budget cuts if taxes like this were not passed.
""Roughly one-third of our corporate fund supports the police department and its related pension obligations. Without new revenue, staffing, training and community-based programs could face cuts,"" Guzman said.

In apress briefing, Johnson advocated for the 1% increase by pointing out that the new tax would only replace the one currently in effect without adding additional taxes.
""TheCity of Chicagowill not enact its own grocery tax. The grocery tax already exists. There is a process in which the collection of the grocery tax is now being placed in the responsibility of municipalities,"" Johnson said on Tuesday. ""We’re not creating a grocery tax. We’re just creating a process by which we can collect it.""
The city council has not yet voted on a replacement tax. Alderman Andre Vasquez pointed out during the meeting that a local tax was not included in Johnson’s 2025 budget, which now puts the council in an awkward position.

""Had it been included in the budget, it might have gotten done in a way that’s going to feel a lot easier than this year,"" Vasquez said. ""Hearing that 200 municipalities that already did it — it’s a bit frustrating. It was a missed opportunity.""
Fox News Digitalreached out to members of the committee for additional comment but did not immediately receive a response.
Though the city council can pass a new tax increase after the October deadline, the City Council Office of Financial Analysisreported in Maythat collections on any new ordinances would not go into effect until mid-2026.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/climate-cult-notice-lawmakers-push-let-feds-hop-blue-state-roadblocks-us-energy-dominance,‘Climate cult’ on notice as lawmakers push to let feds hop blue-state roadblocks to ‘US energy dominance',"Sen.-elect Jim Justice, R-W.Va., discusses his desire to help pass Trump's agenda in Congress and the role his famous dog will play in Washington, D.C.
EXCLUSIVE:The left-wing ""climate cult,"" as one lawmaker put it, will have fewer avenues to throw roadblocks in front of domestic energy production and PresidentDonald Trump's efforts to obtain ""American energy dominance"" if a landmark effort between members of both the House and Senate is successful.
""I am an energy guy from an energy-rich state,"" West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice told Fox News Digital on Thursday before introducing a bill to prevent state governments less supportive than Charleston from getting in the way of the development, transmission and distribution of reliable energy sources.
His House counterpart in the effort, Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., hails from such a place.
Langworthy said that, in contrast to lawmakers in Justice’s state, New York Democrats have ""waged an extremist crusade"" against developing a crucial multi-state natural gas deposit ironically named for a town in the Empire State.
The Energy Choice Act has drawn 37 co-sponsors across the House and Senate.

The bill would prohibit state and local governments from placing restrictions on the connection, re-connection, modification, installation, transportation, distribution, or expansion of a source of energy that is sold in interstate commerce and/or is to be delivered to an end-user.
Justice, when he served as governor, signed multiple bills boosting his state’s own renowned coal industry, including slashing severance taxes, and said the U.S. energy crisis is ""too great"" to allow the ""luxury of picking the winners and losers.""
""Americans ought to have the right to choose what is best for their energy needs.""
Tens of thousands of square miles of themassive Marcellus Shale formationruns through New York, but development has been under a state-sanctioned ban for more than a decade.
Pennsylvania, Ohio andWest Virginia, meanwhile, continue to develop their major caches of Marcellus Shale gas, while the piece of the formation in the Maryland panhandle also remains off-limits.
Those bans, according to Langworthy, have sent home energy costs ""through the roof"" in places like New York, which he said is ""teetering on the edge of an energy crisis—all to satisfy the radical fantasies of the far-left climate cult.""
""New York has been ground-zero for the Green New Deal, where common sense goes to die and working families get stuck with the bill,"" said the lawmaker, a former NYSGOP chairman.
FLASHBACK: JUSTICE IN THE SENATE - WV GOVERNOR VERY INTERESTED IN CHALLENGING JOE MANCHIN

That disparity led him to draft the House version of the bill, hoping, in his words, to ""restore sanity"" to U.S. energy policy and give Americans the choice ofaffordable and reliable power.
They should not be ""forced into rolling blackouts to please eco-activists who don’t live in the real world,"" he quipped. ""I thank Senator Justice for introducing this bill in the Senate and urge its swift action.""
Meanwhile, Justice’s state remains the second-largest coal producer in the nation, and his Senate counterpart, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, also signed onto the bill.
""America needs more energy, and our state and local governments shouldn’t discriminate against baseload energy generation that increases security, affordability, and creates good paying jobs across the country, simply because it doesn’t align with their political agendas,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Gov. Kay Ivey in 2025 signed the Powering Growth Act seeking to streamline the permitting process in the Yellowhammer State, and Sen.Tommy Tuberville– who hopes to succeed the term-limited governor – is another top sponsor of the bill.
""Energy security is national security,"" Tuberville has said.
""For four years, Joe Biden and woke Democrats took a sledgehammer to American energy production. We need torein-in blue stateswho caved to the climate cult and imposed ridiculous regulations that are deeply unpopular with hardworking Americans,"" he said.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/educational-choice-children-act-tax-break-rich-not-lifeline-students,"Educational Choice for Children Act: A tax break for the rich, not a lifeline for students","Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., discusses the House passing the ‘big, beautiful bill’ on ‘Hannity.’
Like many Americans this summer, I’ll be heading to a football stadium to see Beyoncé deliver two hours of magic on herCowboy Carter Tour. I paid a premium for those tickets – and I’m OK with that. It was my choice – not something I can deduct from my taxes or expect to be federally subsidized.
That’s the way it should be.
The same goes for my guilty pleasure: ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians."" I don’t mind watching the antics of one of America’s most famous (and wealthiest) families, but I’d never ask taxpayers to help fund their children’sprivate school tuition.
Instead of helping students in underfunded schools, measures like the ECCA divert public dollars to families who already have access to private education.(iStock)
And yet, some in Congress think that’s precisely what we should do.
TRUMP'S DECISION TO GUT THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT IS NOT ONLY ILLEGAL, IT'S WRONG
A proposal quietly tucked into the House GOP’s reconciliation package, part of what’s being marketed as PresidentDonald Trump’s ""Big, Beautiful Bill,"" would give wealthy individuals and corporations a 100% federal tax credit for donations to private school scholarship funds.
This proposal – the Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA) – effectively allows wealthy donors to turn tuition into a tax write-off.
That’s right. This plan, currently before the U.S. Senate, would allow billionaires to ""donate"" to their kids’ private schools – and then receive every cent back in tax relief, at the expense of American taxpayers.
This is not a small-dollar program. The measure could siphon more than $10 billion away from federal revenues, funds that could otherwise strengthen our nation’s public schools.
Now, I don’t think Blue Ivy Carter or North West needs our help getting into elite institutions. However, the backers of this bill, such as House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, have argued that it’s primarily about helping working-class students escape ""low-performing"" schools.
A FAILING NATION'S REPORT CARD PROVES NEED FOR SWEEPING CHANGE
""It will encourage more individuals and businesses to invest in our children’s futures,"" Stefanik said, ""by establishing a 75%federal tax creditfor qualified charitable contributions made to nonprofit schools with proven success.""
That sounds good – until you look at the evidence.
In practice, measures like ECCA have the opposite effect. Instead of helping students in underfunded schools, they divert public dollars to families who already have access to private education.
We’ve seen it happen in more than 20 states, where private schools receive more than $1 billion each year through similar tax credits, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. A 2023 report in St. Louis Today revealed that most students receiving vouchers in Missouri were already attending private schools, while only 35% came from public schools.
In other words, this isn’t about opportunity. It’s about entitlement.
WHY I DEDICATED MY BOOK ON SCHOOL CHOICE TO RANDI WEINGARTEN
Every year, public schools educate nearly 50 million students – more than 90% of the nation’s children. These taxpayer-funded institutions have produced extraordinary alumni, including the CEOs of Apple, Walmart and the majority of Fortune 500 companies.
Public schools are where kids learn how to live and work in a diverse democracy. They’re not perfect, but they are essential.
Educators know thisbetter than anyone. A 2024 Pew Research Center survey of more than 2,300 public school teachers found that most feel underpaid, under-supported and under-resourced.
Respondents also reported a deep commitment to their students and their profession. More than half of these educators said they wished the public understood the difficulty of their job. Teachers across the U.S. are clear: students don’t need more ""choice"" – they need more investment.
As one Kentucky educator told the Louisville Courier Journal earlier this year, ""If lawmakers actually stepped into our classrooms, they’d see what we’re doing with so little. Give us more counselors, working air conditioning, and reading specialists – don’t hand tax breaks to people who already have advantages.""
MY VISION FOR ELIMINATING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
These educators are on the front lines. They’re not asking for handouts. They’re asking for fairness – and for policies that reflect the real needs of public school communities.
It’s worth noting that the original pitch behindvoucher programs– dating back to the early 2000s – was to help low-income families in struggling urban districts. But decades of research have shown that voucher students don’t perform significantly better in reading or math than their public school peers.
Meanwhile, the programs have drained resources from the very schools most in need of help. That’s not reform. That’s abandonment.
The concept of ""school choice"" has become a catch-all for undermining public education without explicitly stating so. But make no mistake: this is a wealth transfer in disguise, and ECCA is its latest vehicle.
As a son of immigrants and a proud product of public schools, I know firsthand what public education can offer. I’ve seen how classrooms can unlock potential and teachers can change lives.

I’ve also seen what happens when we neglect those systems and call it innovation. This isn’t just bad policy. It’s a betrayal of the American promise.
Let’s be clear: families have every right to choose private or religious schools for their children. But they shouldn’t expect the rest of us to foot the bill.Tax dollarsshould be allocated where the need is greatest – schools that serve all students, regardless of their ZIP code, income or background.
At a time when the country feels increasingly divided, our public schools are one of the few places where kids from every walk of life still come together. That’s something worth protecting, not defunding.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-big-beautiful-bill-needs-makeover,"The ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ urgently needs a makeover to usher in Trump’s Golden Age","Senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought testifying in a House budget hearing as Congress moves to codify DOGE cuts.
PresidentDonald Trumpis working to usher in a new Golden Age for America. But he needs Congress to do its part by ensuring that the""One Big, Beautiful Bill""isn’t neutered by shortsighted compromise.
Recently, Trump gave Senate Republicans the green light to make changes to the House version of his signature legislative initiative, openly acknowledging that there is room to significantly improve on its current form.
I’ve been working publicly and privately to advocate for this bill since before Trump’s reelection, collaborating with some of the greatest business leaders and economists in the country to ensure that we make the absolute most of this rare opportunity to set this country up for long-term economic prosperity.
TRUMP PUSHES 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AS SOLUTION TO FOUR YEARS OF BIDEN FAILURES: 'LARGEST TAX CUT, EVER'
We’ve identified several provisions that add significantly to the bill’s ""score"" from the Congressional Budget Office (a measure of how much the legislation is projected to affect the federal budget) without offering commensurate economic benefits. Addressing these provisions would free up space to expand the bill’s most impactful pro-growth elements — most significantly by creating the budget room to make theTrump tax cutspermanent.

One element of theHouse billthat needs to be eliminated is a provision offering full expensing for new structures. While it might sound like a good, pro-growth idea to allow companies to deduct the entire cost of a new building the year it’s placed into service, in practice no public company would ever take advantage of it — because taking the deduction would slash their reported earnings, harming their stock value and investor confidence.
Even private businesses face structural hurdles, including the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT), income mismatches and the reality that bonus depreciation already provides ample incentive. Buildings are long-term investments. A one-year tax write-off simply isn’t the deciding factor.
GOP SENATORS EXPRESS 'CONCERNS,' 'SKEPTICISM' OVER TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL AFTER MUSK RANT
According to the CBO, however, this provision alone adds $148 billion to the projected cost of the ""Big, Beautiful Bill."" That’s a huge chunk of change that crowds out other worthwhile provisions that companies would actually use to increase productivity and output.
Blue state Republicans successfully fought for the inclusion of a much more generous cap onstate and local tax (SALT) deductions,which the House bill raises from $10,000 to $40,000. The increased cap means that about 90% of filers will be able to deduct the full value of their state and local taxes from their federal income tax, adding an estimated $320 billion to the cost of the legislation.
Once again, however, the projections fail to account for the actual, real-world implications of the provision. Because of the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), very few filers would even be able to claim the full deduction at the $40,000 cap used in the House bill. In other words, blue state Republicans are sabotaging this legislation for the sake of political theater — they don’t expect voters to understand the nuances of tax law, and when they run for re-election next year, they want to be able to tell their constituents that they went to bat for them.

In fact, raising the SALT cap could ultimately hurt many blue state taxpayers, because Democrat elected officials in those states would use the increased cap to justify raising taxes even higher while telling voters that Uncle Sam will be offsetting a significant portion of the cost.
TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' FACES RESISTANCE FROM REPUBLICAN SENATORS OVER DEBT FEARS
We’re fortunate that theTrump tax cutsare coming up for renewal at a time when Republicans control the White House and both Houses of Congress. But who will be in charge the next time the tax cuts are due to expire? We should not be forcing American families to live with the anxiety of wondering whether their taxes will automatically shoot up if the political winds aren’t blowing the right way in the future. Likewise, we can’t expect businesses to make the long-term investments oureconomyneeds if they can’t reliably project tax rates even just a few years into the future.
Certainty and stability are essential to sound economic policy. With the savings from eliminating full and immediate expensing of structures and lowering the SALT cap back to $10,000,Congressshould be able to make the individual and corporate tax reductions permanent, creating the conditions for long-term growth.

The fixes outlined above could also create room in the budget forfull and immediate expensing of R&Dinvestments. Unlike expensing of new structures, companies would eagerly take advantage of tax write-offs on their research and development costs. This was included in the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, but is currently in the process of being automatically phased out.

Competitors such as Great Britain and China are already offering permanent, full and immediate expensing of domestic R&D investments. If America intends to keep up in the race to develop and perfect world-changing new technology like artificial intelligence, we can’t afford to be out-competed by the incentives offered by other countries.
Thanks to President Trump’s visionary leadership, America is on the precipice of a new Golden Age — if only Congress can get tax policy right. We only have one chance.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-polling-expert-marvels-collapse-democratic-advantage-middle-class-trump-era,CNN polling expert marvels at collapse of Democratic advantage with middle class in Trump era,"Democrats were once perceived as the party of the middle class, but CNN polling analyst Harry Enten said that thanks to Trump and Republicans, this historically held belief has been shattered.
CNN senior political data reporter Harry Enten Monday marveled at how Democrats continue to face a stark lack of confidence from voters on the economy and middle class issues.
Voter dissatisfaction with formerPresident Biden's managementof the economy was one of the major issues that led to President Donald Trump's return to the White House. While Trump may have stirred controversy with his tariff and immigration policy shakeups since then, the economy appears to be one key area where he retains voters' trust.
CNN host Kate Bolduan observed as she spoke to Enten that, according toCNN’s own polling,Republicans are actually gaining ground in terms of being trusted to help America's struggling middle class.
""Yeah, you know, historically speaking, ‘Which is the party of the middle class?’ has been a huge advantage for Democrats,"" Enten said, referring to one question from the polling.
CNN polling analyst Harry Enten marveled at how the game has changed in terms of how the political parties are perceived by voters.
FOUR MONTHS INTO TRUMP'S SECOND TERM, DEMOCRATS REMAIN DEEPLY PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THEIR PARTY
He said Democrats had a 23-point advantage on this question in 1989 and a 17-point advantage in 2016, ""But by this decade, we already started seeing declines back in 2022, where you saw that Democrats led, but only by four points, well within the margin of error.""
Now it's tied.
""This, I think, speaks to Democratic ills more than anything else,"" he argued. ""They have traditionally been the party of the middle class. No more! Donald Trump and the Republican Party have taken that mantle away, and now a key advantage for Democrats historically has gone ‘adios, amigos,’ and now there is no party that is the party of the middle class. Republicans have completely closed the gap, Kate.""
Enten also said while one might thinkTrump’s rocky experimentation with tariffsmight shake voters' faith in Republicans and make them consider the opposition, but, ""It ain’t so. It ain’t so!""

The data reporter noted that in November 2023, Republicans had an 11-point advantage as ""the party that is closest to your economic views."" He noted, ""Now it’s still within that range, still within that margin of error, plus eight point advantage for the Republican Party. How is that possible, Democrats?""
Enten continued to break down the numbers, wondering, ""How is it possible after all therecession fears?After the stock market’s been doing all of this, after all the tariffs that Americans are against, and Republicans still hold an eight-point lead on the economy? Are you kidding me?""
He argued that CNN’s poll was echoed by similar findings from Reuters/Ipsos, showing that confidence in Republicans to handle the economy has risen.
""And again, this is after months of supposed economic uncertainty in which the stock market’s been going bonkers, in which tariff wars that Americans are against have been going on. And yet, despite all of that, the Democrats are down by 12 points on the economy,"" he said.

""This speaks to Democratic problems on the economy better than basically anything that you could possibly look at,"" Enten continued, arguing that even if approval ratings are slightly lower than they once were, Republicans maintain a clear advantage with public opinion on their management of the economy.

Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentcalled out CBS ""Face the Nation"" anchor Margaret Brennan on Sunday for warning in March that Trump administration tariffs on imported goods would raise prices for American consumers after inflation cooled to a four-year low in April.
During an interview on Sunday, the CBS anchor again challenged Bessent to respond to the economic concerns PresidentDonald Trump's tariffs posed to consumers, but Bessent argued that ""alarmist"" predictions about inflation increasing had been wrong before.
""Everything has been alarmist, that the inflation numbers are actually dropping,"" he said, referring to the latestBureau of Labor Statisticsreport showing that the inflation rate fell to 2.3% in April, the lowest level in over four years.
Brennan pressed Bessent about retail giants like Walmart and Targetweighing price hikesdue to the uncertainty surrounding the tariffs.

""When you go back-to-school shopping, things are going to cost more,"" Brennan told Bessent.
Bessent disagreed, saying retailers like Home Depot have said they don't plan to raise prices in response to the tariffs.
Brennan insisted consumers would feel economic pain from Trump's strategy. She quoted from a Wall Street Journal opinion piece by Karl Rove warning that companies like Walmart would not be able to break even if they couldn’t absorb the tariff costs.
""But, for consumers, the reality is, there will either be less inventory or things at higher prices, or both,"" she said.
Bessent reminded Brennan that in March, when he previously appeared on ""Face the Nation,"" she had reported that tariffs could lead to inflation.

TRUMP TARIFF PLAN FACES UNCERTAIN FUTURE AS COURT BATTLES INTENSIFY
""Margaret, when we were here in March, you said there was going to be big inflation. There hasn't been any inflation,"" Bessent retorted. ""Actually, the inflation numbers arethe best in four years. So why don't we stop trying to say this could happen and wait and see what does happen?""
""Just trying to gauge for people planning ahead here,"" Brennan replied before moving on to ask about how much Trump’s recent announcement that he was doubling the tariffs on steel would impact the construction industry.
During that March interview, Brennan cited a study from the think tank, The Peterson Institute, predicting that Trump's then-10% tariffs on China and 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico would cost U.S. households an additional $1,200 a year.

Brennan previously clashed with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick over Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement during an April interview where she asked whether ""AI"" was used to craft the tariff announcement.
Trump’s tariff strategy faced legal challenges last week after a federal court ruled unanimously to block the sweeping tariffs he imposed on dozens of countries.
The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled Wednesday that Trump overstepped his authority to impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).

Mike Rounds spoke to Fox News Digital about the U.S.’ efforts to remain the world’s economic and military leader as China makes technological advances.
SIMI VALLEY, Calif. –China's rampanttheft of intellectual property from American institutions and industry must be thwarted as the U.S. battles to remain the world's economic and military leader – but America cannot completely decouple from the economic behemoth, Republican South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview.
The key, according to Rounds, is maintaining China as a key trade partner without giving them access to America's technology, including artificial intelligence and computer chips.
""In doing so, maybe we'll restrict their ability to actually be able to have a market that they can create their own stuff with. They'll be using ours. And in using ours, they'll be our standards,"" Rounds told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview from the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library during the Reagan National Economic Forum on Friday in California.
""Let's not necessarily just totally divest. Let's see if we can have an influence on them and the rest of the world as well when it comes to standards forAI and other technological advancesin the future,"" he added.
Rounds was among the conference panelists who spoke on the threats China poses as President Donald Trump addresses the country's chronic trade deficit with foreign nations, and his optimism for the future as the U.S. sprints to remain the world's economic and military leader.

Rounds' remarks focused on keeping the U.S. in the driver's seat of the world's economy, which he explained is deeply entwined in technological advances and bucking Chinese theft of intellectual property, while also acknowledging and combating how China has advanced into a ""near-peer competitor"" with the U.S. from a military standpoint.

""We've got to do a better job ofprotecting the intellectual propertiesthat we've got. The most advanced types of technologies that we have, everything we can do to slow down their connection with that, protecting against that infiltration or de-filtration of really good information that, right now, they're stealing from us on a regular basis,"" Rounds said during a panel called ""China and the U.S.: When Trading Partners are also Great Power Competitors.""

He added that China has no qualms about stealing U.S. intellectual property – which is understood as intangible creations, such as patents for inventions or trade secrets such as tech algorithms. Rounds recalled a recent conversation with an ambassador to China who told him their culture does not understand ""how someone can own an idea.""
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last Wednesday that the U.S. will begin ""aggressively"" revoking visas of Chinese students, most notably those with ties to the Chinese Communist Party who are trained at U.S. schools, but return to China or feed U.S. information to China.

Rounds said the country needed a pause on admitting Chinese nationals with CCP ties into elite U.S. schools until an enforceable agreement is in place protecting intellectual property and processes from Chinese capture.
""We have Chinese students that come in here, and then they [maintain] ties back home. And even if they want to stay here, one of the challenges we have is that their family may very well be coerced into requiring them to come back home again. And if that's the case, any of the knowledge that we've helped them to develop here goes back home with them,"" Rounds said.
""Until such time as we're able to address that, and until such time as we're able to be assured that the information that they're getting here, the data that they are catching here, the knowledge that they gain here isn't going to be used against our young men and women in the future, we want to slow this down a little bit. Let's just take a break. Let's not be bringing in these Chinese students that have ties with the Chinese Communist Party, until we have some kind of agreement in place that is enforceable,"" he said.

Rounds explained during the Reagan library forum that protecting U.S. intellectual property from Chinese theft has a ripple effect on U.S. efforts to remain the world's military leader as China seeks parity with America.
STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS IT WILL ‘AGGRESSIVELY REVOKE’ VISAS OF CHINESE STUDENTS
""[China is] a strategic challenger for us on the military side. They are a near-peer competitor. And they have an advantage over us in one particular way: They are unified in terms of when Xi Jinping wants to move, it's not just the government that moves, but the entire rest of their economic activity is required to move the way that he wants them to move. We don't have that here. And so for us, we have to recognize that challenge. Now, I'm not suggesting we go the direction that they go, but we have to recognize their ability to move very, very quickly,"" he said.

The Trump administration leveled tariffs as high as 145% on Chinese goods in April, and China retaliated against the president's ""Liberation Day"" policies with tariffs of its own. China and the U.S. reached a preliminary trade agreement last month, which Trump said China violated in a Truth Social post on Friday.

Because of this deal, everything quickly stabilized and China got back to business as usual. Everybody was happy! That is the good news!!! The bad news is that China, perhaps not surprisingly to some, HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US. So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!"" he wrote.

Rounds explained that the U.S. is in the midst of reaching a favorable trade deal while also acknowledging China has stolen billions of dollars in intellectual property for its own advantage.
""We do, right now, really close to about a half a trillion dollars a year in economic activity with China today, but they steal about $600 billion in intellectual property on an annual basis. And so we have this dichotomy of trying to do good trade and at the same time recognizing that they're stealing our property,"" he said.
Rounds said the floodgates of accepting and leveraging AI have not yet opened in the U.S., as many Americans are still hesitant to trust the technology. In mere months and years, however, he said the health industry will see massive overhauls, aided by tech that can quickly identify cancer or diagnose diabetes and Alzheimer's. This will lead American culture to accept AI and rally the private sector's proliferation of it, he said.

""I think what the American people want to see is, what's in it for them? What improves their quality of life? I think one of the most critical issues – that would really be one of the easiest to get into – is talking about health care. And I firmly believe that Americans will see AI as a benefit to them rather than as a challenge when we start to see cures for diabetes, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and cancers. And those are all within reach,"" Rounds told Fox Digital.
Rounds added during the forum that when Americans personally feel how their quality of life has improved due to AI,""that's when we'll really see the push across the country to develop AI at a rate that you've never seen before by the private sector, as well.""
""That's what's going to keep us ahead of China,"" he said.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/invisible-tax-government-debt-crushing-your-finances,Invisible tax: Government debt is crushing your finances,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on senators pushing for changes to the House-passed spending bill as it moves to the Senate for debate.
Mortgage rates rose again this week, with the average 30-year fixed rate climbing past 6.8%. That’s not just a post-pandemic hangover; it’s a warning sign. Behind the scenes,rising government debtis putting steady upward pressure on borrowing costs.
If your mortgage, car loan, or credit card payments are more expensive than they were a few years ago, you’re not alone — and despite what you may have heard, it’s not just because of inflation or Federal Reserve policy. The surge in federal borrowing is helping inflate interest rates across the board.
Ifgovernment debthad stayed at 2015 levels, the typical family could be paying $222 less per month on their mortgage. Go back to 2005 debt levels and the number jumps to $536. That’s real money disappearing from household budgets not because of the jump in home prices, but because Washington can’t stop borrowing.
DAVID MARCUS: WHY NOBODY WANTS TO CUT THE NATIONAL DEBT DESPITE EVERYONE SAYING THEY SHOULD
For years, economists puzzled over why interest rates kept falling. Aging populations, slower productivity, and foreign demand for American debt were all cited as reasons. One result was that Uncle Sam took advantage and racked uplarger deficits and debt. After all, refinancing was affordable at low rates. Another was that Americans got used to lower monthly mortgage payments, auto loans, and other interest rate-related expenses.
Now, we’re grappling with interest rates that have surged and stayed stubbornly high. The change followed a torrent ofunfunded federal spendingin 2020 and especially 2021 which exploded the deficit, shook investor confidence in America’s long-term fiscal stability, and caused bond markets to react to policymakers’ fiscal bravado.
My new research for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, along with a growing body of economic literature, shows the debt itself is pushing up long-term interest rates — and by more than some experts are willing to admit. While broader economic changes and policy decisions also play roles, this particular problem is too big to ignore.
Over time, as trillions of dollars in debt compound, the Treasury shells out hundreds of billions more in interest payments. It’s not just a problem for Washington’s balance sheet. It’s a problem for yours.
Economists have a term for what’s happening: ""crowding out."" When the government borrows more, it competes with private borrowers for capital. And when two consumers want the same thing, the price usually goes up — in this case, the price of borrowing (interest rates).
All kinds of important things become more expensive: mortgage payments, car loans, student loans, credit card debt. These are not abstract concerns. They determine whether plenty of families can afford to buy a home, send someone to college or buy a new car or truck. They determine whether someone can start or expand a business and provide more people with jobs.
Take housing. Mortgage rates are now hovering near their highest levels in over 20 years. That’s not because lumber or labor costs spiked, but because of the effects of federal borrowing.
Student loan interest rates are tied to Treasury yields, which means college graduates are now repaying debt at the highest rates in almost two decades. Auto loan rates are rising too, pricing out lower-income consumers.
For Americans with credit card debt (almost half of U.S. households carry a balance) the average interest rate is now around 20%, driven in part by the same upward pressure caused by growing federal debt.
Thesedebt-driven rate increasesare an invisible tax on all of us. Families feel the squeeze every month. Businesses delay investments. Budding entrepreneurs face higher hurdles.
Why aren’t more economists talking about the problem? It’s complicated.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), for example, significantly underestimates the effect. Its latest projections assume long-term interest rates will stabilize at lower levels even as government debt as a share of the economy grows. But if debt pushes rates up more than the CBO predicts — as most empirical studies now show — then its rosy forecasts won’t reflect how much the federal government will pay just in interest.
Beyond our own households, there are consequences for the whole economy and government. Higher interest costs mean less money for education, infrastructure, or tax relief. They increase the risk of a debt spiral in which interest payments themselves become the fastest-growing part of the budget.

Most people understand that the federal government’s borrowing binge can’t go on forever, and that it will burden future generations of taxpayers. But if you’re between the ages of 19 and 99, the tax is probably already hitting you in some way each and every month. The cost of inaction isn’t just abstract and long-term, it’s concrete and already being felt.

(City of Chicago)
Chicago Democratic MayorBrandon Johnsonlaid into the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and PresidentDonald Trump'seconomic policies during his weekly press availability, drawing parallels between the Third Reich in Germany and Trump's second term in the White House.
Johnson saidthe Windy City is the most ""pro-worker"" city in the U.S., but faces ""hostility"" from Washington.
""The fact that the President of the United States of Americais cutting off food supplyand medicine to working people and families across this country — that is an act of war,"" Johnson fumed.
""And we're going to need leaders who are prepared and willing to stand up for working people, because this battle has reached our front doors all across America where people are struggling and suffering. And in order to alleviate that pain and discomfort, it's going to require bold leadership. We can't tippy toe.""
PROPOSED CHICAGO POLICE RESOURCE CUTS COULD LAND CITY IN COURT, TOP OFFICIALS WARN
Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson.(AP/Charles Arbogast)
Addressing a reporter who asked how to work with the Trump administration for the benefit of the city from such an adversarial position, Johnson cited Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker’s State of the State address in February, which referenced how it ""took the Nazi’s one month, three weeks, two days, eight hours and 40 minutes to dismantle a Constitutional Republic.""
""Governor Pritzker… offered up a warning,"" Johnson said. ""You have a president that is cutting off medicine and food, a president that is working to erase culture. I mean, you can't make this up. He's doing it in plain sight.""
Pritzker had compared the rise of former German Chancellor Adolf Hitler to Trump’s popularity, in that the eventual national-socialist dictator was seen as the answer to ""inflation and [the public] looking for someone to blame.""

In his remarks,Johnson notedhow people have wondered how Germany could have descended into Nazism and anti-Semitism so quickly and dreadfully, saying that Trump is ""carry[ing] out the playbook that was done against an entire people-group.""
""He’s doing it right here in this country, against working people, erasing Black folks from museums and the history and the culture. So, when you ask how we balance that, you have to fight it and resist it with everything that's in you,"" he said.
""The President of the United States of America is capturing the hopes and aspirations of working people and holding us hostage as he works to implement and annihilate democracy,"" Johnson said, returning to comment on lawsuits the city has joined to halt DOGE-type efforts.
Chicago is party to a lawsuit filed by several municipalities, including Baltimore; Santa Clara, California; and the county that encompasses Houston, which seeks to stop DOGE’s slashing of the federal bureaucracy.
""Congress created these federal agencies. It funded them. But the president is trying to fire all these people and gut these agencies that Congress created,"" Chicago Deputy Corporation Counsel Steve Kane told thecity’s ABC affiliate, calling the situation unconstitutional.
DOGE-driven cuts affecting the Windy City have included the Energy Department’s 2025 Small Business Expo, originally pinned for June.
The cut came as part of billions in spending reductions for cabinet agencies, and other closures of clean-energy-centric operations have affected the city, according to reports.
Earlier in May, Chicago hired Ernst & Young, an international consulting firm, to find ways to bridge its own budget gaps,according to Bloomberg. The Trump administration has threatened to withhold funding from sanctuary cities, a definition within which Chicago falls.

While city-specific data was not immediately available for DOGE-related cuts, the Trump administration saw the Department of Health & Human Services cut its regional office in Illinois, which served 28,000 low-income families.
Efforts to consolidate federal real estate and office space affected America’s third-largest city as well. The Federal Transit Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, Labor Relations Authority and Civil Corps of Engineers all saw their offices there shut down. A federally-owned art collection in Chicago also sees some of its staffing on the chopping block,according to Axios.

EXCLUSIVE:The Department of Labor is suspending operations ofJob Corpscenters across the nation after revelations that the program, which costs taxpayers more than $1.7 billion per year, is no longer achieving its intended outcomes and is putting students in danger.
Job Corps was originally created to help young adults build a pathway to a better life through education and community. But Trump administration officials told Fox News Digital that an ""in-depth fiscal analysis and a startling number of serious incident reports reveal the program is not helping students achieve intended outcomes or keeping them safe.""
NEW REPORT EXPOSES HOW GOVERNMENT PROGRAM WITH EYE-POPPING BUDGET IS FAILING VULNERABLE STUDENTS
The decision to suspend the program comes after the Job Corps transparency report was compiled and released in April, finding that the average graduation rate for the program was just 38.6%.
Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer told Fox News Digital that ""a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.""(Allison Robbert/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
The graduation rate of the program costs as much as $155,600 per student, the report states. The average cost of a four-year college education in the United States is $153,080, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
Additionally, once those students move through the program, the study found that they are largely being hired in minimum-wage positions, with participants earning $16,695 annually on average after they leave the program.
Currently, there are approximately fewer than 25,000 students enrolled in the Job Corps program, and participants’safetyis ""often at risk.""
Officials said there were 14,913 serious incident reports filed in 2023. In 2023, 373 instances of inappropriate sexual behavior and sexual assaults were reported; 1,764 acts of violence were reported; 1,167 breaches of safety or security were reported; 2,702 instances of drug use were reported; and 1,808 hospital visits for students were reported.
Trump administration officials told Fox News Digital that the Department of Labor is beginning a phased pause in operations at contractor-operated Job Corp centers nationwide, initiating an orderly transition for students, staff and local communities.

Currently, there are 123 Job Corps centers across the United States, and 99 of the centers are run by contractors administered by the Department of Labor.
An official said that those contracts will be terminated to pause operations. The remaining 24 centers are run by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and will not be impacted by the suspension.
The pause of operations at all contractor-operated Job Corps centers will occur by June 30. During the transition, the Department of Labor will collaborate with state and local workforce partners to assist current students in advancing their training and connecting them with education and employment opportunities.
Once the phased suspension occurs, students will be connected to other resources and will be registered within the American Job Center closest to their home and the Labor Exchange system in their home states.

""However, a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis reveal the program is no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve.""

The program began in 1964 as part of former President Lyndon B. Johnson’s war on poverty under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. The program was intended to give young people from low-income backgrounds a chance to gain academic, vocational and social skills in a residential setting.
For program year 2024, Job Corps was operating at a $140 million deficit, requiring centers to be paused to save approximately $119 million to reach the end of this program year.
Department of Labor officials project that in program year 2025 the deficit would grow to $213 million.
""The program has been in a financial crisis for years, creating constant uncertainty for participants and administrators,"" a Department of Labor official told Fox News Digital.
The official stressed, though, that the Department of Labor is ""not eliminating Job Corps,"" and stressed that only Congress has that authority.
In December 2024, the Biden administration’s Department of Labor instituted a similar pause in operations at two of the Job Corps centers, amid concerns of issues and rising program costs.

Officials said that, at this point, the Job Corps program is financially underwater, and the funds appropriated by Congress for the year will not cover the costs of operations for the remaining program year.
Officials said the pause will allow the department to reassess program alignment with the Trump administration’s ""workforce priorities, proposed budget framework, and overall vision for building a modern and effective workforce development program for America’s youth.""

We’re all familiar with the impact of regulations. Sometimes, they’re in your face, like the taxes we pay or how long it takes to navigate the DMV. Other times, they’re pedantic annoyances, like the permits some states require for kids’ lemonade stands or when hair braider licenses require more training hours than EMTs.
And sometimes they even impact how you take out your trash.
That’s what we’re seeing inCalifornia, where a combination of state, federal and county regulations resulted in the closure of a landfill that was serving Los Angeles County. Local citizens, the landfill and elected officials are dealing with a challenging and rare chemical reaction taking place in an old part of the landfill. It has been a massive undertaking that involves federal and numerous state regulatory bodies.
CALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000
But here’s where theprogressive rubbermeets the reality road: People didn’t stop throwing out their trash, so the closure hasn’t solved any problems. It’s merely increased the cost and complexity of trash removal, because county taxes are now paying for transport to a landfill further away.
Too often,government policiesare based not on helping people, but on a politician’s personal and professional goals. Is there a financial crash? Regulate the banks (after bailing them out)! Is healthcare expensive? Put stringent regulations on them (even though it increases the costs)! Close all the restaurants during COVID (but keep open the ones that serve Hollywood)!
These grandstanding policies have real impacts on real people. When the federal government was raising the minimum wage almost two decades ago, Walmart received a lot of praise for supporting the effort. The problem was that Walmart pay was already above the minimum wage, so there was no impact on that company. But there were a lot of impacts on its small, local competitors, who went out of business.
That’s good for Walmart. For small business owners? Not so much.
California is theposter childfor policies that generate attention but have little positive impact on those who have the least flexibility and power. One of the highest income taxes (to fund social welfare)? Check. Insane cost of living (caused in cities like San Francisco by housing regulations and across-the-state by high taxes)? Check. Massive environmental bureaucracy that somehow leaves fire hydrants depleted, reservoirs empty and trash removal more expensive?

Check, check, check. And as we’ve seen, not even landfills — or your trash cans — are safe.
It’s no wonder Golden State residents can’t flee fast enough. And those who are left behind may not have enough jobs to support them. From 2018 to 2021 alone, 352 companies moved their headquarters out of California to more business-friendly states because, in part, they don’t want to pay the state’s 8.84% corporate tax rate, which is the eighth-highest in the nation. Instead, they are heading to states like Texas, which has no corporate tax.

With fewer people, there are fewer households to pony up taxes and fund the extravagant programs that elected officials in California have enacted. That means the residents and businesses who decide to stick it out are now faced with even higher taxes, increased costs of living and higher fees for trash pickup.
Regulations havereal impacts, especially in states like California that are so over-regulated that even trash collection is affected. That’s a basic municipal service that is essential to the health and well-being of all residents. But maybe they won’t be residents for much longer anyway. Maybe those dinner table conversations will be about which state they should pack up and move to.

When then-President-electDonald Trumpdeclared to me on January 5 of this year that ""My preference is one big, as I say,one big, beautiful bill,""he started a snowball rolling down Congressional Hill that has gathered momentum and should be on his desk, perhaps by July 4, and certainly not later than Labor Day weekend. Trump willed H.R. 1 into being the way he willed his return to the Oval Office: By speaking clearly and repeatedly about what had to be done. Turns out the commander-in-chief is also the ""closer-in-chief.""
Of course, the House and Senate GOP knew they could not have allowed Trump’s 2017 triumph of his first tax bill to expire at the end of this year and thus shatter an economy recovering its bearings and its potential for great growth after the disastrous years of inflation unleashed by former President Joe Biden’s reckless looting of the federal treasury.
But neither did it seem likely they could make the Trump tax code permanent as well as add more cuts to taxable income for folks who depend on tips, for seniors and for homeowners in states with burdensome tax rates.
SCOOP: HOUSE GOP MEMO HIGHLIGHTS REPUBLICAN WINS IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'
But the president worked so closely with House SpeakerMike Johnson,Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Majority Whip Tom Emmer that he not only got the ""one, big, beautiful bill"" through the House, he got what he promised on the campaign trail last year. Now he seems likely to help Senate Majority LeaderJohn Thuneand Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso and Conference Chair Senator Tom Cotton pilot H.R. 1 through the narrows of that body.

But the challenge will come when the Senate ""leaves its fingerprints"" on the bill, as West Virginia Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito put it to""the fellas""on the ""Ruthless"" podcast this week. Senators have ideas too. They are equal participants with the House members and the Senate GOP can also only lose three of their 53 votes and still carry the ""one, big, beautiful bill"" forward.
There are two things which can be done to make the bill better and also create some space for money for rural hospitals which, as Capito stressed, is of great concern to many in the GOP conference.
MIKE JOHNSON, DONALD TRUMP GET ‘BIG, 'BEAUTIFUL’ WIN AS BUDGET PASSES HOUSE
The first big change is to add a process by which entitlement reform could commence, and the second is an""IRA/401k conversion window""where a flat tax would be applied to seniors who wish to convert their IRA/401k assets into Roth IRAs, a window which if opened for this tax year, would yield trillions in revenue next year and thus prevent the ""one, big beautiful bill"" from increasing the debt, while also being wildly popular with the demographic most likely to vote in the 2026 mid-terms.
First, fiscal hawks worried about the rising debt could be lured into supporting the final version of the bill by the promise of a shot at entitlement reform — not cuts — in this Congress. To accomplish this requires the senators remember both the ""Greenspan Commission"" and the ""BRACs.""
The Greenspan Commission, officially the National Commission on Social Security Reform, was a bipartisan commission appointed by President Ronald Reagan and the leaders of the two houses in 1981 to address a short-term financing crisis facing Social Security.
Led by Alan Greenspan, its report produced the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which included both benefit-reduction and revenue-raising measures to address the projected funding shortfall. Social Security was in much worse shape then than now. Now, Social Security, as well as Medicare and Medicaid, need reforms, not benefit cuts.
INSIDE TRUMP'S URGENT MEETING WITH HOUSE GOP TO PASS THE 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'
The ""BRAC"" was the Base Realignment and Closure Commission, established by law, which proposed closures or realignments of military facilities across the U.S and the world to improve efficiency and reduce costs. A BRAC Commission has been used five times — with rounds initiated in 1988, 1991, 1993, 1995 and 2005 – and each produced lists of military bases and facilities to be combined or closed.
Its members compiled the lists and the result was presented to Congress with the choice: do nothing and the BRAC recommendations became law or pass a resolution rejecting them all. It was and remains a brilliant idea that can be applied to entitlement reforms produced by a new Greenspan Commission.
Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo told Hugh Hewitt that a flat tax on IRA/401(k) conversions could raise at least $1 trillion.

The new commission, like the original, would be made up of presidential and congressional appointees. It would be tasked with proposing entitlement reforms that would — very gradually— make entitlements fiscally stable. (An example: Raise the retirement age a month every year for the next 40 years, which would raise the retirement age to 69 by 2065. That is a ""reform"" not a cut, one so gradual as to be unnoticed by Social Security recipients who are already working longer without a prompt from the federal government. Similar reforms for Medicare and Medicaid can be put into place that allow for gentle transitions of the sort that responsible reforms embrace.)
TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' PASSES KEY HOUSE HURDLE AFTER GOP REBEL MUTINY
I’ve written about the second big add-onbefore: the flat tax on IRA/401(k) conversions.
Idaho Republican Senator Mike Crapo, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told me last month this reform is very much on the table. It would raise at least a trillion dollars in one-time revenue and perhaps twice that amount or more. There is opposition from the retirement planning community that operates IRAs and other retirement vehicles, but those offered a 10% or 15% or even a 20% tax on conversion from standard retirement accounts to Roth accounts would applaud long and hard and remember this change come November 2026.
Led by Alan Greenspan, its report produced the Social Security Reform Act of 1983, which included both benefit-reduction and revenue-raising measures to address the projected funding shortfall.
The impact of the amendment to the tax code would fly through theSenateparliamentarian’s review under the ""Byrd rule"" and more than balance out the fiscal impact of increasing the SALT deduction. Here’s to sanity among the bill’s drafters in the Senate: Sometimes the obvious thing to do is also the right thing to do.

With just these two additions to the bill, both fiscal hawks and the politically minded would find the ""one, big, beautiful bill"" a magnet that could not be resisted.
All the Senate has to do is polish up H.R. 1 and the Congress can go home for a well-earned summer vacation.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-tariffs-tax-cuts-crushing-main-street-making-mar-a-lago-elites-rich,Trump's tariffs and tax cuts are crushing Main Street and making Mar-a-Lago elites rich,"House Speaker Mike Johnson discusses the House budget bill supported by President Donald Trump and more on ‘Fox News Sunday.'
President Donald Trump’stariffs are already the biggest middle-class tax increase in modern history, raising the prices he promised to lower. Now even more tariffs threaten an economy already staggering from the uncertainty set off by Trump’s erratic policies, attacks on the rule of law, and threatening statements.
Adding more injury to injury, Trump and his MAGA allies just forced the ""Big Beautiful Bill Act"" through the House of Representatives -- by one vote. Their divisive, financially unhealthy approach boils down to trillions in tax cuts for the ultra-rich, devastating cuts in basic health care and food services, and crippling new debt for us, our kids, and grandkids. Worse yet, right after the bill passed, Trump proudly announced more job-killing, cost-raising tariffs on allies and iPhones.
When he ran for president in 2024, Trump promised us inflation would end ""immediately"" and that we’d feel prices falling on ""Day One."" To millions of 2024 swing voters -- a decisive voting bloc in the election -- that was the whole point of choosing him. But now prices are higher, economic growth is declining and life is harder than it was when Trump took the oath of office in January.
ELON MUSK 'DISAPPOINTED' BY TRUMP'S SPENDING BILL, SAYS IT UNDERMINES WHAT DOGE IS DOING
Since Inauguration Day, consumer sentiment has plunged to historic lows. Moody’s downgraded America’s credit rating for the first time in over 100 years.  Ford and Walmart are raising prices because of the tariffs.
Now, instead of making our economy take off like a ""rocket ship,"" as he also promised, Trump is killing it with a sweetheart tax deal for his Mar-A-Lago friends. A president who promised to stand up to the establishment is effectively laundering taxpayers’ money to line the silk pockets of his own preferred elites -- to the detriment of middle-class families and American business.
Now, the American economy, which was unequivocally outperforming every other country on earth when Donald Trump tookover, is falling behind in ways it hasn’t in decades.
NO MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'
Special tax giveaways, like a write-off for buying private jets, are paid for with the biggest Medicaid cuts in history, higher health insurance premiums, and gutting food programs for distressed working families. They’re putting the rest of the price tag on the nation’s credit card, adding trillions to the debt and raising the cost of a house, car, or student loan.
In communities all over the country, the tariff taxes are crushing supply chains and freezing hiring decisions. Port traffic is sporadic, and retailers warn of empty shelves in the stores.
InNorth Carolina, Trump’s tariffs arepenalizingthe manufacturers he claims to be supporting, killing jobs and reducing U.S. exports.  Just when a Greenville-based manufacturer was on the verge of plant renovations that would add 25 new jobs, the equipment they needed to expand was hit with a new tariff. The manufacturer was explicit: ""Our company has been working for years to install a state-of-the-art manufacturing line in our North Carolina plant … Unfortunately, today’s tariffs make it uneconomical to ship this line to the U.S.""

This MAGA agenda comes at the expense of basic economic security for average Americans. Tariffs rob them of their buying power and their jobs.  Billions in cuts toMedicaid and Medicare. Cancelled health coverage for millions. SNAP, the nation’s food relief program, would be starved. Trump’s tax cuts come straight out of programs that help the neediest people in society.
Meanwhile, job-creating, cost-cutting policies like the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act’s energy and manufacturing policies are being senselessly undermined -- harming red states and blue states alike.

Some of the cuts from the $2 trillion piece of legislation signed into law by then-President Joe Biden in 2021, included creating an ""Office of the Unemployed Workers’ Advocate"" and funding an ""Equitable Access Director.""
Other cuts included initiatives to ""conduct a business process analysis for equity,"" developing an ""equity analytics dashboard,"" studying the ""equity of the unemployment system,"" conducting a ""DEIA assessment"" and funding ""equity monitor staff.""

""If I didn’t do that deal with China, I think China would have broken apart,""President Donald Trump told Fox News' Bret Baierearlier this month.
Trump was talking about the arrangement, announced May 12, in which the United States and China agreed, among other things, to reduce their general tariff rates on the other by 115 percentage points for 90 days.
Most analysts have scored the pact as a win for China. The reduction in American tariffs allows China to resume sales to the U.S.—America accounts for more than a third of global consumer spending—but the reduction in Chinese tariffs does little to permit American goods to enter China. The main obstacles to American exports to China are China’s non-tariff barriers, and the announced pause does nothing to end non-tariff barriers put in place before April 2, ""Liberation Day,"" as Trump called it.
BILLIONAIRE RAY DALIO RAISES ALARM OVER CHINA, SAYS TRUMP RENEGOTIATING TRADE DEALS 'HAS TO HAPPEN'
Moreover, the reduction inU.S. tariffsis akin to unilateral disarmament. U.S. tariffs are generally remedies for China’s theft of U.S. intellectual property and its increasingly predatory trade practices. During the pause, China is continuing these unacceptable practices without facing the penalty of America’s elevated tariffs.
""China came out on top,"" Alan Tonelson, an American trade expert who blogs at RealityChek told me. ""No question, we got the short end of the stick.""
Trump’s ""tariff war,"" as the Chinese regime calls it, could not have come at a worse time for the Communist Party.
The country’s economy was already in distress. Yes, the National Bureau of Statistics continually issues reports of robust growth of gross domestic product—5.4% in the first quarter—but in reality, the economy looks like it is contracting. Price data for February, March, and April confirm China is in a deflationary spiral.
DONALD TRUMP DETAILS 'MOST EXCITING PART' OF CHINA TRADE AGREEMENT
Trump’s ""Liberation Day"" tariffs battered China’s already struggling export sector. Factories were closing, unpaid workers were demonstrating in the streets, smaller banks were restricting withdrawals. As Trump suggested to Baier, the Chinese regime was struggling and might not have survived his high tariffs.
The 90-day pause, therefore, gave the Chinese regime a lifeline. Now,China’s factoriescan make and ship products to America for the most important time of the year for them: the Christmas season, which starts around June.
The Communist Party is no stranger to rescues from America. Three times American presidents have saved communism in China.
TRUMP SAYS CHINA AGREES TO 'FULLY' OPEN COUNTRY'S MARKETS TO US BUSINESSES
Richard Nixondid that in 1972, near the end ofMao Zedong’sdecade-long Cultural Revolution, essentially a civil war that almost brought down the regime. His visit to Beijing signaled to the Chinese people that America stood with communist rule.
George H. W. Bush threw Deng Xiaoping a lifeline after the nation-wide demonstrations and slaughter in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Finally, there wasBill Clinton’strade deal in 1999, which came at a low point for a Chinese state then struggling to emerge from the Asian Financial Crisis. The deal paved the way for China’s fabulously beneficial—and wholly premature—entry into the World Trade Organization.
TRUMP SAYS 'TOTAL RESET NEGOTIATED' WITH CHINA DURING TARIFF TALKS IN GENEVA
Washington had a great need to enlist Mao in the Cold War struggle against the Soviet Union, but Bush and Clinton would have been much better off without the Chinese Communist state.
Bush and Clinton, leading a dominant America, thought that Chinese leaders would reciprocate and work cooperatively with Washington and its partners. The Communist Party, almost everyone then assumed, would see it in its interest in maintaining an international system that was responsible for China’s rise.
""By now, it’s clear that our hopeful assumptions about China’s trajectory were fundamentally wrong,"" Charles Burton of the Sinopsis think tank told me this week. ""As China grew stronger, the Communist Party became even more hostile, belligerent, and dangerous.""
This month,Xi Jinpingdemonstrated that cooperation with his hostile, belligerent, and dangerous regime is not possible. First, China violated its promise to remove all ""the non-tariff countermeasures taken against the United States since April 2, 2025."" Among those countermeasures is theApril 4 prohibition of export of magnets and certain mineralsto the U.S., which is still in place.

Then, the Communist Party, through the semi-official Global Times tabloid, signaled it would not by the end of 90 days remove what Trump on May 12 called ""all of its non-monetary barriers.""
Finally, on May 18, the Chinese central government upped the stakes,provocatively imposing a 74.9% anti-dumping dutyon U.S.-made POM copolymers, an industrial plastic.
China’s response to Trump’s concessions was ""blatantly dishonest,"" Charles Burton, also a former Canadian diplomat in Beijing, said. ""Bad faith bargaining is the Communist Party’s stock-in-trade,"" he added.
""Trump’s comments to Bret Baier show that the president let up on China at exactly the wrong time,"" Tonelson pointed out.

Trump has aggressively asserted executive authority in his second term, overturning longstanding government policy and aiming to make major cuts to the federal workforce through an avalanche of sweeping and controversial executive orders and actions, with some aimed at addressing grievances he has held since his first term.
Trump started his second administration with poll numbers in positive territory, but his poll numbers started to slide soon after his late-January inauguration.

But two issues where the president remains at or above water in some surveys areborder securityand immigration, which were front and center in Trump's successful 2024 campaign to win back the White House.
Trump stands at 56% approval of border security and 50% approval of immigration in theMarquette Law School poll,which was conducted May 5-15.
But Trump's muscular moves on border securityand immigration, which have sparked controversy and legal pushback, don't appear to be helping his overall approval ratings.
""Immigration is declining now as a salient issue,"" said Daron Shaw, who serves as a member of the Fox News Decision Team and is the Republican partner on the Fox News poll.
Shaw, a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas, said ""immigration and especially border security are beginning to lose steam as one of the top three issues facing the country. Republicans still rate them fairly highly, but Democrats and independents, who had kind of joined the chorus in 2024, have moved on and, in particular, moved back to the economy as a focal point.""

Pointing to Trump, Shaw added that ""when you have success on an issue, it tends to move to the back burner.""
Contributing to the slide over the past couple of months in Trump's overall approval ratings was his performance on the economy and, in particular, inflation, which were pressing issues that kept former PresidentJoe Biden’sapproval ratings well below water for most of his presidency.
Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners, triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.
But the markets have rebounded, thanks in part to a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff as Trump tapped the brakes on his controversial tariff implementation.
Trump stood at 37% approval on tariffs and 34% on inflation/cost of living in the Marquette Law School poll. And he stood at 39% on the economy and 33% on cost of living in theReuters/Ipsos poll, conducted May 16-18.

Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist and former RNC and Bush administration official, pointed to last year’s election, saying, ""The main reason Trump won was to lower prices. Prices haven’t lowered, and polls are reflecting that.""

""With the exception of gas prices, there hasn’t been much of a reduction in prices,"" Shaw said.
""Prices haven’t come down, and it’s not clear that people will say the absence of inflation is an economic victory.

""What Trump is realizing is that prices have to come down for him to be able to declare success.""

https://www.foxnews.com/media/mike-rowe-warns-declining-work-ethic-younger-generations,Mike Rowe warns of declining work ethic problem as younger generation 'snowflakes' face fewer consequences,"'People You Should Know' host Mike Rowe weighs in on Gen Z's demand for work-life balance on 'The Story.'
Former ""Dirty Jobs"" host Mike Rowe warns the United States is facing a work ethic problem, largely among Gen Z and other young generations, and argues a world without ""deadlines"" and ""consequences"" has fueled the potential crisis.
Over the last few years,many critics have questionedthe work ethic of members of Gen Z (generally anyone born between 1997 and 2012) and have expressed concern over how this affects young people entering the workforce.
GEN Z BRANDED AS 'THE GHOSTED GENERATION' AS DATES, COLLEGES AND EMPLOYERS KEEP SAYING 'NO'
Rowe explained to ""The Story"" this week that one overriding factor contributing to the decline in work ethic is that younger generations face more lenient deadlines and less ""consequences."" When this happens, Rowe said, expectations and standards of workers can become ""fungible"" quickly.
Many Gen Zers also benefit from having parents who are all-too-willing to financially help them.
""I think that if you live your life on a high wire with a safety net 15 feet below you all of the time, there's no consequence for falling,"" Rowe explained.

The longtime TV host explained that this apparent work-ethic dearth did not just happen, saying that ""we're the clouds from which the snowflakes fell.""
Rowe believes there is a warped understanding of how the employment market works right now. He argued that a tight labor market is allowing for additional accommodations because people are not ""lining up"" to do the work needed.
""We've got a huge labor shortage and the push to get to the AI thing over the finish line. That means data centers. We've got to train people to build these data centers,""  he said.
Rowe is also the CEO of the mikeroweWORKS Foundation, which advocates for skilled trades as valuable and lucrative career paths and offers a Work Ethic Scholarship Program for those pursuing skilled trades.
MIKE ROWE ON LABOR SHORTAGE UNDER BIDEN""S ECONOMY: WORK HAS BECOME THE ‘ENEMY’
He highlighted that his scholarship program makes several demands from individuals vying for the scholarship money. The majority of these tasks fail to be completed, Rowe revealed.
""They're started, but they don't finish them for the exact reasons we're talking about. So, yeah, it's a problem,"" he said, saying that it's an issue he is unsure how to remedy.
Gen Z Is the Least Financially Confident Generation(Wealth of Geeks)
""The world is either going to change toaccommodate the current generation, or the current generation is going to change to accommodate the world they're living in,"" Rowe lamented..
Rowe said that 2,200 kids in his foundation that have learned to bewelders, plumbers, and other tradesare making six figures, saying that people are either ""inspired"" by those people or they are not.

Leaving the military and moving back into civilian life is a major shift — but for America’s heroes, there is one organization that is helping to make the transition smoother.
The Honor Foundation (THF) is assisting veterans as they transition by using the power of network building — one cup of coffee at a time.
Headquartered in San Diego, California, the foundation works with veterans of America'sSpecial Operations Forcesto help them find their purpose after they leave the armed forces.
THE HONOR FOUNDATION HELPS AMERICA'S HIGHLY TRAINED MILITARY SUCCEED 'ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE UNIFORM'
The foundation's ""cups of coffee"" program then draws on an internal directory of mentors and alumni to connect with those in the program.
Alex Moffitt of Springfield, Virginia, was in theU.S. Armyfor 10 years. She served as an air defense artillery officer, U.S. Army Special Operations Civil Affairs, then led a civil affairs team.

""THF was a turning point,"" Moffitt told Fox News Digital.
""It helped me reflect and reconnect with a new purpose after having a very clear professional purpose from the time I was 18 to 32, since going into the civilian world has a different ‘feel.' It helped me build the confidence topursue entrepreneurship.""
There are some 3,700 alumni of the program to date, the foundation noted.
Moffitt arranged for many ""cups of coffee"" introductions, whether in person over coffee, during zoom interviews or at in-person events, she said.

""Onecoffee chatled to my first startup fellowship.""
Moffitt co-founded her own startup, Clara Copilot, an Al platform that gives a cognitive edge to organizations in the digital age, she said. She used another coffee meeting to develop the marketing strategy.

""This particular sub-set of transitioning veterans has lived a life in the ‘gray’ for 20+ years in most cases. My role is to [help] them become comfortable.""
""They are not a burden to their network — they just need to ask!""
Phillips added, ""A key role for THF members is building a digital brand and tapping intotheir vast network,while reinforcing that they are not a burden to their network — they just need to ask!""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bipartisan-effort-launched-onshore-manufacturing-key-supplies-never-before-made-usa,Bipartisan effort launched to onshore manufacturing of key supplies never before 'Made in USA',"White House senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro discusses President Donald Trump’s announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom on ‘The Will Cain Show.’
EXCLUSIVE:Senators fromboth sides of the aisle will put forward a resolution calling on Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to seek out new sites and critical infrastructure for high-demand products that are currently not made in America, and analyze the viability of making such products here.
Senate Small Business& Entrepreneurship Committee chairwomanJoni Ernst,R-Iowa, and Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, D-Del., came together Friday to launch the effort – citing the dual need for onshoring supply chains while bolstering the U.S. workforce.
The Critical Infrastructure Manufacturing Feasibility Act would force Lutnick to report within 18 months on critical infrastructure sectors where products face material, sourcing, or supply-chain constraints that prevent them from being domestically produced.
The Commerce Department would then have to analyze the feasibility of producing that product in the U.S. – and whether such products’ newly-onshore production can be established in underserved rural areas and industrial parks.

Both Ernst’sand Blunt Rochester’s states are vastly rural. In the latter, suburban sprawl from Wilmington gives way to miles of coastal plain.
In recent years, the cities of Newark and Middletown have seen a boom in industrial parks and warehouses for major companies like Amazon seeking out the First State’s famously low-tax and tax-free environs.
""Supply chains are key to global competitiveness and our national security,"" Blunt Rochester told Fox News Digital.
""This bipartisan legislation will help us identify where we rely too heavily on foreign imports for critical infrastructure and explore how we can bring that manufacturing home.""

The Delawarean added that strengthening domestic production not only protects our supply chains, ""it supports American jobs, revitalizes local economies, and reinforces our nation’s resilience if global manufacturing disruptions occur.""
Ernst added that the bill seeks to make the U.S. less dependent on foreign adversaries for critical infrastructure and key manufacturing supply chain preservation.
""I am working to make ‘Made in America’ the norm instead of the exception,"" she said.

""That starts with ensuring that our manufacturers are able to get the materials they need right here instead of having to import supplies from halfway around the world. Beyond boosting domestic industry, this bill is also about safeguarding our national security by ensuring that we are not dependent on any foreign adversary for critical goods that we need.""
Ernst has also spearheaded efforts to onshore the pharmaceutical supply chain from China. Many key ingredients in medicines are not produced in the U.S., and instead predominantly in Ireland and China.
While one is a longtime U.S. ally, the other’s involvement in the supply chain could lead to national security risks, critics have said.

As Americans hit the road for the Memorial Day holiday weekend, they're getting good news at the gas pumps.
While gas prices have risen roughly 20 cents per gallon since PresidentDonald Trumpreturned to the White House in January, according to GasBuddy, a fuel savings platform, ""all 50 states are lower than last Memorial Day.""
And GasBuddy notes thatgas pricesare at their ""lowest seasonal (Memorial Day) level since 2021.""
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports that when adjusted for inflation, the average U.S. retail gasoline prices going into Memorial Day weekend are 14% lower than last year, in large part because of falling crude oil prices.
FOX BUSINESS: GAS PRICES HIT 4-YEAR LOW AHEAD OF MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND

As of Friday, AAA reported that the national average for regular gasoline stood at $3.20 per gallon.
And while gas prices traditionally increase heading into spring and summer, normally due to increased demand for summer travel and refineries switching to summer gasoline blends – which are less likely to evaporate but are more expensive to produce –GasBuddyexpects prices to ease slightly during the next few months heading into Labor Day.
OIL PRICES ARE DOWN OVER LAST SIX MONTHS: WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR GAS PRICES?
The falling prices at the pump could be good political news for Trump and Republicans aiming to defend their Senate and House majorities in next year's midterm elections.
""Gas prices fell for the third month in a row,"" the White House spotlighted last week, as it argued, ""Workers See Relief in President Trump’s Economy.""

But pointing to Trump's sweeping tax and spending cuts package, which narrowly passed the House on Thursday, Hunt said ""there is a lot of hope and optimism"" that the measure, if passed into law, ""will help spur additional investment"" and ""will provide the sort of growth that you need across the economy.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-upholds-trumps-removal-biden-appointees-federal-boards,Supreme Court upholds Trump's removal of Biden appointees from federal boards,"Fox News legal editor Kerri Urbahn joins 'The Faulkner Focus' to discuss 14 states suing to block DOGE from accessing federal data as legal battles over President Donald Trump's executive orders continue.
The Supreme Court upheld President Donald Trump’s removal of two Democratic appointees from federal boards, handing the administration a legal victory and settling a high-stakes dispute over the president's power to fire agency officials.
The Thursdayrulingcomes afterSupreme CourtChief Justice John Roberts agreed to temporarily halt the reinstatement of National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) member Gwynne Wilcox and Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) member Cathy Harris, two Democrat appointees who wereabruptly terminatedby the Trump administration this year.
Both had challenged their terminations as ""unlawful"" in separate lawsuits filed in D.C. federal court.
However, the high court suggested that it could block attempts to fireFederal ReserveChair Jerome Powell, who, according to Trump, has complained has not cut interest rates fast enough.

The issue confronting the justices was whether the board members, both appointed by President Joe Biden, can stay in their jobs while the larger fight continues over what to do with a 90-year-old Supreme Court decision known asHumphrey’s Executor,in which the court unanimously ruled that presidents cannot fire independent board members without cause.
The court’s three liberal justices dissented.
""Not since the 1950s (or even before) has a President, without a legitimate reason, tried to remove an officer from a classic independent agency,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.
Kagan wrote that her colleagues were telegraphing what would happen.

""The impatience to get on with things—to now hand the President the most unitary, meaning also the most subservient, administration since Herbert Hoover (and maybe ever)—must reveal how that eventual decision will go,"" she wrote.
Lawyers for the Trump administration urged the Supreme Court to either keep Wilcox and Harris off the job while the case moves through the lower courts, or to resolve the issue directly. They asked the justices to grant certiorari before judgment – a fast-track procedure the court uses occasionally to bypass the appeals process in cases of significant national importance.
They urged that Wilcox and Harris not be reinstated to their positions, arguing in their reply brief that the ""costs of such reinstatements are immense.""
They argued that keeping both Wilcox and Harris in place would ""entrust"" the president's powers ""for the months or years that it could take the courts to resolve this litigation,"" something they said ""would manifestly cause irreparable harm to the President and to the separation of powers.""
The U.S. Supreme Court is shown at dusk on June 28, 2023 in Washington, DC(Drew Angerer/Getty Images)
""The President would lose control of critical parts of the Executive Branch for a significant portion of his term, and he would likely have to spend further months voiding actions taken by improperly reinstated agency leaders.""
In April, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit voted 7–4 to restore Wilcox and Harris to their respective boards, citing Supreme Court precedent in Humphrey’s Executor v. United States and Wiener v. United States – landmark rulings that upheld limits on the president’s power to remove members of independent federal agencies.
The majority noted that the Supreme Court has never overturned the decades-old precedent upholding removal protections for members of independent, multimember adjudicatory boards – such as the NLRB and MSPB – and said that precedent supported reinstating Wilcox and Harris.
It also rejected the Trump administration's request for an administrative stay, which would have allowed their removals to remain in place while the challenge proceeds in court.
""The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it,"" judges noted in their opinion.
The ruling would have temporarily returned Harris and Wilcox to their posts – but the victory was short-lived. The Trump administration quickly appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted an emergency administrative stay blocking their reinstatement.
In their own Supreme Court filings, lawyers for Wilcox and Harris argued that the court should reinstate them to their roles on their respective boards until a federal appeals court can consider the matter.

Both Wilcox and Harris opposed the administration’s effort to fast-track the case, warning against skipping the normal appeals process and rushing arguments. ""Rushing such important matters risks making mistakes and destabilizing other areas of the law,"" Harris’s lawyers told the Supreme Court this week.
Wilcox, the NLRB member, echoed this argument in her own brief to the high court.
Counsel for Wilcox cited the potential harm in removing her from the three-member NLRB panel – which they argued in their filing could bring ""an immediate and indefinite halt to the NLRB’s critical work of adjudicating labor-relations disputes.""
""The President’s choice to instead remove Ms. Wilcox does not bring the Board closer in line with his preferred policies; it prevents the agency from carrying out its congressionally mandated duties at all,"" they said.
Harris and Wilcox's cases are among several legal challenges attempting to clearly define the executive's power.
Hampton Dellinger,a Biden appointeepreviously tapped to head the Office of Special Counsel, sued the Trump administration over his termination. Dellinger filed suit in D.C. district court after his Feb. 7 firing.

He had maintained the argument that,by law, he could only be dismissed from his position for job performance problems, which were not cited in an email dismissing him from his post.
Dellinger dropped his suit against the administration after the D.C. appellate court issued an unsigned order siding with the Trump administration.
The Justice Department, for its part, said in February a letter to Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., that it was seeking to overturn Humphrey's Executor.

But Trump's muscular moves on border securityand immigration, which have sparked controversy and legal pushback, don't appear to be helping his overall approval ratings.
""Immigration is declining now as a salient issue,"" said Daron Shaw, who serves as a member of the Fox News Decision Team and is the Republican partner on the Fox News poll.
(Fox News)
Shaw, a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas, said ""immigration and especially border security are beginning to lose steam as one of the top-three issues facing the country. Republicans still rate them fairly highly, but Democrats and independents, who had kind of joined the chorus in 2024, have moved on and in particular moved back to the economy as a focal point.""
Pointing to Trump, Shaw added that ""when you have success on an issue, it tends to move to the back burner.""
Contributing to the slide over the past couple of months in Trump's overall approval ratings was his performance on the economy and, in particular, inflation, which were pressing issues that kept former PresidentJoe Biden’sapproval ratings well below water for most of his presidency.
Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.

But the markets have rebounded, thanks in part to a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff as Trump tapped the brakes on his controversial tariff implementation.
Trump stood at 37% approval on tariffs and 34% on inflation/cost of living in the Marquette Law School poll. And he stood at 39% on the economy and 33% on cost of living in theReuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted May 16-18.
Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist and former RNC and Bush administration official, pointed to last year’s election, saying, ""The main reason Trump won was to lower prices. Prices haven’t lowered, and polls are reflecting that.""

""With the exception of gas prices, there hasn’t been much of a reduction in prices,"" Shaw said.
""Prices haven’t come down, and it’s not clear that people will say the absence of inflation is an economic victory. They still feel that an appreciable portion of their money is going to pay for basic things,"" he added. ""What Trump is realizing is that prices have to come down for him to be able to declare success.""

Recently, my five kids got a taste of European living. We visited Big Ben and the Tower of London — and back at our Airbnb, we sweltered in 80-degree heat with no A/C and hung our laundry to dry.
They loved the sightseeing. The no-air-conditioning part? Not so much.
In Maryland, our summer electricity bills soar as temperatures rise. Every now and then, the utility company includes cheerful tips to cut costs along with our bill — suggestions like turning the A/C down or off and line-drying laundry. Well, I just spent a week doing exactly that. Let’s just say I have no plans to make it a permanent lifestyle.
CALIFORNIA'S GREEN NEW SCAM COULD COST YOU $20,000
This summer, we’re bracing for even higher bills and potential outages. On especially hot days, we were already getting texts from our energy provider warning of strain on the grid. It’s only going to get worse this year.
Air conditioning is something Europeans often don't have. American liberals want to import that reality to the US.(iStock)
When we first moved in and signed up for service with ourenergy company,we opted for a budget plan. Then we learned it came with a catch: they could cut or reduce our power during peak demand. That constant cycling on and off ended up breaking our already-finicky HVAC system. The savings from that program shaved a few dollars off our bill every month — but it cost us over $10,000 in a new HVAC unit.
The way to lower our costs isn’t these bait-and-switch programs, but changing the irresponsible way our state government handles our energy.
GREEN NEW HEADACHE: DEMS FLEE GOV’S GREEN ‘ENERGY MASTER PLAN’ AS ELECTION APPROACHES
Increased usage with the seasonal weather changes isn’t the only reason costs are climbing.Maryland residents are now paying moreto import electricity from out of state, thanks to lawmakers who pushed to shut down coal and natural gas plants — our primary energy sources — without any viable alternatives in place.
Maryland’s climate goals are nothing if not ambitious: a 60% reduction in emissions by 2031 and net-zero by 2045. But these targets seem less like a plan and more like numbers pulled from a hat. No roadmap, no accountability, and certainly no grasp of the real-world impact on families like mine.
Worse,Maryland began phasing out power plantswith no replacement ready to go. Only 7% of our electricity comes from renewables, so we’re importing more — at higher cost. Those costs are, of course, passed directly to taxpayers.
It doesn’t stop there.The governments of Baltimore, Annapolisand Anne Arundel County are pursuing lawsuits against energy companies, blaming them for climate change. These suits claim fossil fuel companies have long known their products were damaging the planet.

Suing them doesn’t cool our homes; it’s an exercise in futility. But the cost of fighting this litigation passes more costs down to their constituents: businesses and families just trying to survive.
If successful, these lawsuits could force energy companies to pay billions. Those costs won’t come from corporate profits — they’ll show up on our bills. Companies may leave the state or raise rates just to keep the lights on.

CREDIT: U.S. Department of Transportation
FIRST ON FOX:Government watchdog group Democracy Restored is calling on theDepartment of Justice (DOJ)to investigate U.S. attorneys in the Southern District of New York (SDNY), accusing them of potentially seeking to undermine Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy's efforts to end New York City's driving tax, also known as a congestion tax.
New York City'scongestion pricing programessentially assesses drivers a toll for driving on some streets in Manhattan, with the price varying depending on the time of day.
Late in the night of April 23, SDNY attorneys representing Duffy and the Department of Transportation published an 11-page confidential memo in federal court in Manhattan, explaining that the Trump administration's argument to end the NYC driver's tax was weak and included ""considerable litigation risk."" The next day, the memo was taken down from the public case docket, and theU.S. Attorney's Officefor the Southern District said the filing was a mistake.
In response, officials at the Transportation Department said they would be transferring the case to the DOJ's civil division, according to theNew York Times. Fox News Digital reached out to the DOT to confirm the attorneys involved in the mistaken filing were off the case, but did not immediately receive a response.

""It's imperative to know whether this filing was inadvertent, and incompetent, or something worse,"" Houston Keene, the director of Democracy Restored said. ""The memo contains confidential legal advice that just happens to criticize the secretary and department's legal strategy — quite an inconvenient document to have made public for lawyers doing their best for their client.""
Democracy Restored said in its letter that more fact-finding must take place, but indicated there are ""a variety"" of potential ethical and legal violations associated with the mistaken filing, particularly if the act was done on purpose.
While it can not be concluded whether the act stemmed from incompetence, or whether it was purposeful, Democracy Restored points to the ""partisan political activity"" and involvement in political non-profits by the attorneys involved, suggesting it could shed light on the motivations behind the action.
EXCLUSIVE: 'SHADY TRIAL LAWYER PIPELINE' FUNNELING MILLIONS TO DEMOCRATS, ACCORDING TO REPORT
According to Democracy Restored, the attorneys involved were allregistered Democratsand had a history of donating to Democratic political candidates and campaigns. The attorneys' public social media posts also showed them supporting left-wing political groups and acts of defiance against President Donald Trump's executive directives.
""US Attorneys must be nonpartisan and objective in their work and the partisan backgrounds of these attorneys add to the doubts,"" Keene said. ""Far too many questions remain unanswered about this incident. The DOJ must investigate this matter immediately.""
In early January, NYC launched its congestion pricing program, ordriver's tax,which imposed a $9 daytime toll on most individuals driving their cars into Manhattan's core, south of Central Park. A month later, the Trump administration issued a federal order meant to halt the program by March 21, but the tolls have continued as the result of a federal lawsuit filed by New York City's Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), the state agency that runs New York City's public transit system.

The Department of Transportation and the MTA subsequently reached an agreement extending the deadline to end the program until at least the fall. Earlier this month, as the legal battle over the matter has continued, New York City and the MTArequested a federal judge block the Trump administration's effortsto squash the program. City officials say the program has significantly reduced congestion, improving travel times due to reduced traffic.

Because the program involves tolls on federal highways, it must have Department of Transportation approval.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nebraska-becomes-first-state-approved-ban-soda-purchases-food-stamps,Nebraska becomes first state approved to ban soda purchases with food stamps,"FOX Business correspondent Kelly Saberi reports on how twelve states are pursuing waivers to have junk food banned from the federal aid program on ‘Special Report.’
Nebraska is the first state to receive a federal waiver to ban the purchase of soda and energy drinks under the benefit program for low-income Americans long known as food stamps.
The move, announced Monday by U.S. Agriculture SecretaryBrooke Rollins, would affect about 152,000 people in Nebraska enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps families pay for groceries.
""There's absolutely zero reason for taxpayers to be subsidizing purchases of soda and energy drinks,"" Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen said in a statement. ""SNAP is about helping families in need get healthy food into their diets, but there's nothing nutritious about the junk we're removing with today's waiver.""
ARKANSAS MOVES TO BAN 'JUNK FOOD' FROM SNAP PROGRAM: 'DEFINITION OF CRAZY'
Six other states — Arkansas, Colorado, Kansas, Indiana, Iowa and West Virginia — have also submitted requests for waivers banning certain foods and drinks or, in some cases, expanding access to hot foods for participants, according to the USDA.
The push to ban sugary drinks, candy and more from the SNAP program has been a key focus of Rollins and Health SecretaryRobert F. Kennedy Jr.

Rollins called Monday's move ""a historic step toMake America Healthy again.""
MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN: TIMELINE OF THE MAHA MOVEMENT
Details of Nebraska's waiver, which takes effect Jan. 1, weren't immediately available. Anti-hunger advocates criticized it, saying it adds costs, boosts administrative burdens and increases stigma for people already facing food insecurity.
The waiver ""ignores decades of evidence showing that incentive-based approaches — not punitive restrictions — are the most effective, dignified path to improving nutrition and reducing hunger,"" said Gina Plata-Nino, a deputy director at the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit advocacy group.
SNAP is a roughly $100 billion program that serves about 42 million Americans and is run by the U.S. Agriculture Department and administered through states.

The program is authorized by the federal Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which saysSNAP benefitscan be used ""for any food or food product intended for human consumption,"" except alcohol, tobacco and hot foods, including those prepared for immediate consumption.
Over the past 20 years, lawmakers in several states have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for everything from bottled water and soda to chips, ice cream and ""luxury meats"" like steak.
Until now, USDA rejected the waivers, saying there were no clear standards to define certain foods as good or bad. In addition, the agency had said restrictions would be difficult to implement, complicated and costly, and would not necessarily change recipients' food purchases or reduce health problems such as obesity.",5/20/2025

""And yes, The Wall Street Journal may say America is smart enough to know better. I will tell The Wall Street Journal this: America, I believe, clearly was not smart enough to keep this guy from the White House.

She was responding to aWSJ editorial board piecethat criticized Trump and his tariff policy, accusing the president of going ""full Kamala Harris in demanding that the retail giant not raise prices.""
McCaskill's comments came during a panel discussion on MSNBC's ""Deadline: White House"" that focused on concerns over higher prices after the president said big retailers like Walmart should ""eat the tariffs.""

""They’re all going to know that they’re spending more at Walmart than they spent this time last year. They’re all going to know that their 401(k)s are down. They’re all going to know that, and there’s nothing Trump can do about that,"" she added.
Walmart CEO Doug McMillon warned ofpotential price increaseson Thursday, citing the tariffs.
Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentsaid Sunday that the retail giant would absorb the cost of some of the tariffs, after speaking with McMillon.
MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace echoed McCaskill's argument, saying some Americans were paying close attention to the news and others were not.
""I used to read polls that separated Americans out that way. People paying close attention to the news, and God bless those people. Those are our daily viewers. They are policy wonks. They know more about a lot of the things we talk about than I do. I see a lot of their responses and people that don’t follow the news. This was the first time I read that poll, and I read it and thought, like, #dreams. I wish I was one of them, but I get it. Everyone’s about to feel the burn,"" Wallace said.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-big-beautiful-bill-needs-fat-shot-end-our-dangerous-debt-addiction,Trump’s ‘big beautiful bill’ needs a 'fat shot' to end our dangerous debt addiction,"National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett unpacks the importance of economic growth under President Donald Trump on 'The Story.'
The United States has a hair-on-fire problem: its debt. This reality is not disputed by pretty much any credible person or entity, including the Treasury and the Fed.U.S. government debtis massive, currently north of 120% of GDP, an amount that is close to double what many institutions consider to be sustainable debt levels.
Our deficit is running at a wartime level, around double the historic average as a percent of GDP, and interest on the debt has now surpassed spending on defense, which is not a healthy indicator for a country and its fiscal stability.
A main cause of this issue isCongressand their years of reckless overspending. Unfortunately, it lies in their hands to fix the problem they helped create.
US HEADING TOWARDS ECONOMIC ‘HEART ATTACK’ IF DEBT IS NOT CUT SOON: WORLD’S LARGEST HEDGE FUND FOUNDER
Currently, Congress is at work on ""one big, beautiful bill"" to address taxes and spending. And what we have seen thus far is still too big and doesn’t address the critical issues at hand. Frankly, the new bill needs a ""fat shot"" (the humorous moniker President Donald Trump used for weight-loss drugs like Ozempic). And without it, we are just going to push our country nearer to a fiscal cliff.
America is facing a looming debt crisis. Will Congress have the will to fix it?
The problem with our finances is not one of tax collection, it is a spending problem. Federal government ""revenue"" was nearly $5 trillion for last fiscal year. That is more than the GDP of every country on earth, except the U.S. and China. Still, that is not enough for the government, which then spends that $5 trillionplusanother $2 trillion – around 6-7% of GDP – which then needs to be financed.
After decades of being irresponsible, we are dangerously close to thatfiscal cliff.I worry about the prospects of a debt spiral. That is where the interest on our debt drives up the deficit (as it has). As the government needs to finance that deficit, the supply of Treasury debt increases. That then drives up Treasury yields, which increases our interest costs. That increases the deficits, which again have the same impact and that vicious cycle continues.
SEAN HANNITY: THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION IS A 'TOTAL, UNMITIGATED DISASTER'
And that’s with debt servicing costs, running at $1.2 trillion at the end of 2024, plus entitlements already exceeding the tax revenue collected, before considering any other spending.
Yet, while everyone knows our debt position is a problem, there doesn’t seem to be the political will to fix it.
In a recent X post, Stephen Moore, who has advised Trump on economic issues,posted, ""You’ll need a microscope to see the GOP’s spending cuts! The CBO projects a staggering $89.3 trillion in federal spending over the next decade. The House plan proposes a mere $1.2 trillion reduction, leading to a total of $88.1 trillion—a tiny 1.5% cut! Meanwhile, the Senate suggests an almost laughable $4 billion reduction against $521 billion in increases. By 2035, the GOP’s ‘starvation diet’ still lands us at $10 trillion in spending—up from last year’s $7 trillion, only 40% increase instead of 50%.""
This does not bode well for our financial future.
SHOCKING GOVERNMENT REPORT REVEALS NATIONAL DEBT CRISIS GREW MUCH WORSE UNDER BIDEN

New survey data indicates that one in four job applicants has lied, exaggerated or provided inaccurate information on their applications in some way, shape or form — and Gen Z leads the trend.
Thefindings from career.io— a career services platform — indicate nearly half (approximately 47%) of the age group admitted to falsifying some aspect of their job applications to fit the mold they think employers are looking for, followed by 38.5% of millennials, 20.4% of Gen Xers and 9.4% of baby boomers.
A spreadsheet detailing the survey data, provided toFox News Digital, indicates that a majority of zoomers (slang for Gen Z) lied in key areas such as ""work experience"" (22.97%), and job ""responsibilities"" (28.38%), with ""job title"" coming in third at 17.57%. The large percentages indicate some survey participants falsified more than one area of their job applications.
Across all generations, ""work experience"" and ""responsibilities"" ranked the highest out of all falsified categories, but to a lesser degree than zoomers.
GEN Z BRANDED AS THE 'MOST GULLIBLE GENERATION' AFTER NEW ANALYSIS OF MEDIA HABITS
Jobseekers may falsify parts of their applications to appear more appealing to potential employers.(iStock)
Certified Professional Career Coach (CPCC) Amanda Augustine told Fox News Digital the prevailing reason for the falsehoods is that young applicants with limited experience are desperate to make a good first impression and get their foot in the door.
""You hear so much of people complaining about this big resume hole their applications have fallen into, and it's out of sheer desperation that they're trying to enhance their experience in a way that will hopefully land them at least that interview,"" she said Tuesday.
Augustine has worked with multiple clients over the years to help them reach their full professional potential.
She has heard many of these clients say they would be great for a role, even if they don't appear perfect on paper, and they only need the chance to prove themselves.
""I think it's that sentiment across all generations, but especially this younger generation that has not necessarily had to face the job market before, is really fueling some of these white lies, some of these flat-out lies that they're putting on applications,"" Augustine said to Fox News Digital.

The data appears to reflect a desperation to appear ""experienced"" that steadily declines with age, indicating those still relatively new to the job market are uncertain about the navigation techniques they need to employ to find work.
The dropoff between zoomers and millennials who admitted to lying with regard to job responsibilities was approximately 8 percent, with Gen Xers and baby boomers continuing to dial back the intensity.
In the ""work experience"" area, zoomers' 22.97% still sat a few points higher than millennials' 18.70%. Compare that to Gen Xers and baby boomers at 9.51% and 3.59%, respectively.
Augustine says some of the falsehoods, such as lengthening the time worked at a specific location, are done to mitigate the stigma of employment gaps, something job applicants are forced to confront from time to time.
""I think people are really trying to find ways to do little stretches of the truth that they believe will land them that interview so that those small inconsistencies will just kind of be swept under the rug and ignored if they make a great impression during the interview process,"" she said.

Augustine says, for those with limited experience who want to appear as capable as possible for a role, focus on taking an inventory of your skills.
""There is such a greater emphasis placed on the soft skills such as collaboration, communication, problem solving. I mean, who doesn't need a creative problem solver for their business these days? I can't think of an industry where that wouldn't be helpful in some shape or form,"" she said.

But providing examples of times you have had to use the skills you profess to have or closing skill gaps through means such as taking an online course or learning from free demos are also important, she noted.
Then there's networking — another useful tool in your tool belt if you're trying to get your foot in the door.
""I can't say it enough. Especially in this current economy and job market, networking is always going to be key. I don't care if you just graduated from school, or you have 30-plus years of experience. Everybody has a network, whether they realize it or not — that is your classmates, your mentors, your career advisors, your professors, people you've mentored in the past, people that you've worked with previously… If you aren't connecting with those people on LinkedIn and growing your professional network and investing in managing those relationships, you are doing your job search a major disservice.""

SB 5232 was passed as the state faces a $16 billion budget shortfall. In addition, Ferguson recently signed a handful of bills to protect immigrants' rights, including measures to allow the state to inspect privatedetention centersand prohibit bail bond agents from enforcing immigration laws.

In a move that adds to an ever-growing stack of court interventions that have stymied the president's second-term agenda, afederal judgeblocked the Trump administration from targeting foreign service workers' collective bargaining rights amid an ongoing challenge against an executive order.
The American Foreign Service Association, a labor union for foreign service workers, lodged a legal challenge after PresidentDonald Trumpissued an executive order earlier this year that, according to a White House fact sheet, aimed to ""end collective bargaining with Federal unions in"" various government entities ""with national security missions.""
""Certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump’s agenda,"" therelease asserted. ""Protecting America’s national security is a core constitutional duty, and President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts to protect Americans and our national interests.""

The order signed by Friedman states, in part, that Trump's executive order ""is unlawful as applied to the Defendants who are heads of agencies with employees represented by the Plaintiff.""
""The effect of the Executive Order was substantial: it removed collective bargaining rights from approximately two-thirds of the federal workforce,"" Friedman'sopiniondeclared, echoing verbatim a sentence included in anopinionFriedman issued last month in a similar case.
In that case, which was brought by the National Treasury Employees Union, Friedman also targeted Trump's executive order and granted a motion for a preliminary injunction.

A new national poll released this week is one of the first to indicate a bump up in PresidentDonald Trump's approval ratings after a steady edging down in the president's numbers since he returned to office in January.
Trump stands at 44% approval and 52% disapproval in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Monday and Tuesday (May 12-13). The president'sapproval ratingedged up two points — which is within the survey's sampling error — from the previous Reuters/Ipsos national survey, which was in the field late last month.

Likely fueling the modest increase in the president's overall approval rating is his performance on the economy. The new poll indicates 39% of adults nationwide give Trump a thumbs up on how he is handling the economy, up three points from last month.
Thenew pollwas conducted amid this week's surge in the stock markets following a truce between the U.S. and China in their tariff standoff, and in the wake of last week's signing of an initial trade deal with the U.K. — which is the first since Trump implemented massive tariffs on friends and foes across the globe six weeks ago.
WHAT'S IN THE TRADE TRUCE WITH CHINA
Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement in early April sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.

However, as Trump has partially reversed course in recent weeks by easing back on his sharpest trade moves, public concerns about recession have also slightly eased, while still remaining at heightened levels.
Sixty-nine percent questioned in the new poll said they were worried about a recession, down from 76% a month ago. Additionally, concerns about the stock market dropped seven points, to 60%.
Veteran Republican strategist Colin Reed told Fox News that the president has ""been very clear-eyed about the fact that you are going to have to break some eggs to make an omelet and his voters will give him the latitude to do so.
""We’re still less than 150 days in, he’s got some time to make the hard calls that have to be made and still give the economic plane runway to take off ahead of the midterms, which is when all of these early decisions will be graded,"" Reed added.
WHERE TRUMP STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLL
Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president'spoll positionwhen he started his second tour of duty in the White House nearly four months ago.
Trump stood at 44% approval and 55% disapproval in the most recentFox News national poll, which was conducted April 18-21.
(Fox News )
An average of the latest national surveys puts the president's approval rating underwater by around four points, but that is a slight improvement from late last month.
The economy, and inflation in particular, were pressing issues that kept former PresidentJoe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency, and which greatly contributed to Trump's White House victory last November.
They were behind Trump's slide in the polls so far this year.

""Trump’s return to office did not begin as he and his supporters had hoped. Campaign promises about inflation and interest rates appeared deferred while the daily news coverage focused on the many distractions plaguing the White House,"" longtime political scientist and analyst Wayne Lesperance noted.
However, Lesperance, president of New England College, said that ""signs of progress may be emerging. Possible trade deals with Britain, China, and India are providing hope that some good may come from his tariff strategy. Add to that a rebounding stock market and lower gas prices at the start of summer vacation season and the president may see some calming of public nervousness.""

PresidentDonald Trump’stariff diplomacy has been a shock treatment to the global economic order, intended as a kind of radiation and chemotherapy to kill the cancer that created the Rust Belt. But overdoing the treatment can kill the patient instead, without removing the carcinogens in the economy. Fortunately, the administration’s negotiators have called a truce, and we can reevaluate the treatment’s effectiveness.
The last five weeks have seentremendous market turmoil, and not just domestically. The chaos that ensued after April 2 extended around the globe and has forced many nations to the negotiating table with the US—and that includes countries that engage in unfair trade practices. In that sense, the tariffs have been successful.
The Trump administration’s play here is to use tariffs as a tool of statecraft to force other nations into reducing their trade barriers through bilateral negotiations. To that end, the preliminary agreement with the United Kingdom shows some promise.
America must also seriously evaluate what turned the Industrial Belt into the Rust Belt. This hollowing out of the nation’s industrial base was not caused primarily by international trade. Instead, the primary carcinogens were terrible regulatory and tax policies.
President Trump has also used the threat of tariffs very effectively to help secure America’s southern border and stem the flow of fentanyl, which had become the number-one killer of young people.
INFLATION TICKED SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN APRIL AS TARIFF IMPACT LOOMS
Butthe drama around tariffshas had side effects, like chemotherapy killing off healthy cells in the body. This collateral damage could be found in survey data from the regional Federal Reserve Banks and purchasing manager indexes, all of which pointed to sharp declines in business optimism and planned capital expenditures.
In short, the on-again-off-again nature of these tariffs has made it extraordinarily difficult for businesses and consumers to plan. There has also been substantial turbulence in Treasury markets, gold prices, and equities.
That is not a broad condemnation of tariffs, just as the side effects of chemotherapy and radiation are not a denunciation of cancer treatments. But it does illustrate why heavy-duty therapies like radiation must be used in a targeted manner. The inaccurate ""reciprocal"" tariff rates released on April 2 caused significant—and unnecessary—damage domestically.
During the current pause in this tariff fight, theTrump administrationwould do well to reevaluate its tariff strategy, ensuring, for example, that its reciprocal tariff rates are in fact truly reciprocal.
TRUMP REPEATEDLY WALKED BACK TARIFFS IN FIRST 100 DAYS AS WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES LATEST DUTY TAX RELIEF
America must also seriously evaluate what turned the Industrial Belt into the Rust Belt. This hollowing out of the nation’s industrial base was not caused primarily by international trade. Instead, the primary carcinogens were terrible regulatory and tax policies.
Most of our economic wounds are self-inflicted.Chinadid not build a massive, bureaucratic regulatory state in this country. Likewise, we can’t blame China for our burdensome, overly complicated tax code with high marginal rates. We did that to ourselves.
This is perhaps best illustrated by answering a geography question: where is the Rust Belt? It’s inChicago, Detroit, Cincinnati, Youngstown, Pittsburgh, etc. In other words, it’s those areas of the country where liberals have imposed particularly high taxes, overregulation of industry, and forced unionization.

Conversely, where is manufacturing seeing a rebirth in America? It’s coming back in places like Texas, Tennessee, and the Carolinas—states with low (or no) income taxes, less regulation, and right-to-work laws.
Failed domestic public policy is the primary carcinogen wrecking America’s industrial base, and tariffs can’t fix that. At best, fixing international trade problems will give a temporary boost to domestic manufacturing, but the cancer will keep growing.
President Trump’s tariff diplomacy is working to create a level playing field and open foreign consumer markets to domestic producers, but America needs to look within toreshore manufacturingand rebuild the industrial base.
Just throwing tariffs at the problem is like undergoing chemotherapy and radiation without any lifestyle changes. Imagine enduring all the painful side effects of such treatments while smoking cigarettes, maintaining a poor diet, avoiding exercise, and exposing yourself to asbestos and too much sunlight—that’s the equivalent of what’s happening today!

If you think this is hyperbole, consider that the regulatory compliance cost for manufacturers in America is about $50,000 to $60,000 per worker, and then there’s a tax burden on top of that.Reducing trade abusesis insufficient to reform the domestic policies which have made American workers unemployable in many industries.
Tariff diplomacy can go a long way, provided it is targeted and tailored, but we still need a tax-cut bill and more deregulation if we want to heal the patient.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., discusses the progression and success of President Donald Trump’s tariff deals on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’
The House committee tasked with writing the U.S. tax code is meeting on Tuesday afternoon to advance one of the most significant portions of PresidentDonald Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""
A sweeping piece of legislation unveiled by the House Ways & Means Committee on Monday would follow through on Trump's campaign promises to eliminate taxes on tips and overtime pay, as well as permanently extending the president's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), among other provisions.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., has said he wants House Republicans to pass their version of Trump's bill by Memorial Day or ""shortly thereafter,"" as he told Fox News Digital in an interview late last month.
House and Senate Republicans are working on Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in power to sideline the minority by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage to a simple majority, provided the legislation at hand deals with spending, taxes or the national debt.
ANTI-ABORTION PROVIDER MEASURE IN TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' COULD SPARK HOUSE GOP REBELLION

Ways & Means Committee lawmakers are expected to meet for at least several hours on Tuesday to mark up debate on the bill.
It could go even longer, however. A Ways & Means Committee markup meeting in 2021, when Democrats were trying to pass Build Back Better, lasted over 35 hours over four days due to Republicans dragging the process out in opposition to then-President Joe Biden's progressive tax policies.
Democrats are expected to put up an aggressive fight on Tuesday as well, having already accused Trump of trying to cut taxes for the wealthy while gutting critical programs for low-income Americans.
Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., a member of the committee, posted on X on Monday, ""Going over line-by line last minute 389-page amendment to the Republican tax bill in our committee today. They have provisions that touch everyone: the richest people get huge tax cuts, working people lose their healthcare and future generations get the bill because it adds $5 trillion to the national debt!""
However, Republicans have insistedtheir tax billchampions the working and middle classes, pointing to Trump's elimination of tips on tax and overtime pay as evidence points.
A portion released by the House Ways & Means Committee over the weekend would increase the current maximum Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $2,500. Trump's TCJA had doubled the maximum from $1,000 to $2,000 in 2017.

It would also boost the maximum deduction for qualified business income, a tax provision known as 199A, from 20% to 22%. That would largely affect small business owners whose entities are taxed under individual income tax rates.
Trump's promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security for retirees is tackled via giving seniors a higher standard deduction.
""It puts the interests of low-income, working families ahead of the wealthy by expanding tax relief to those who need it the most – including the President’s priorities of no tax on tips and overtime pay and additional relief for America’s seniors,"" House Ways & Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said in a statement.
The legislation also cracks down on big colleges and universities, including Ivy Leagues like Harvard University, which are locked in a battle over free speech with the White House. It is targeting those larger schools with higher excise taxes, which are federal duties paid on net earnings of the schools' investments.
That rate is currently 1.4%, but the legislation would bring it to as high as 21% for the largest schools, like Harvard and Yale University.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS RELEASE TAX PLAN FOR TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'

The House Energy & Commerce Committee, for instance, is also meeting on Tuesday afternoon to advance its portion of the bill. The broad-ranging committee has jurisdiction over Medicaid, Medicare, energy production and telecommunications.

The full House and Senate must pass identical versions of the final bill before it gets to Trump's desk for a signature.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/billionaires-boomed-biden-era-fed-became-engine-income-inequality-powered-pandemic-policies,Billionaires boomed in Biden era as Fed became 'engine of income inequality' powered by COVID policies: expert,"Economist Peter St. Onge discusses fears of a recession and the impact of President Donald Trump's trade war on 'The Will Cain Show.'
The nation's wealthiest residents saw their billions grow even larger in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic due to policies from theFederal Reservethat have deepened the chasm of income inequality, economic experts report.
""If you look at the amount of federal regulation, the amount of federal taxes, if anything… the economy has gotten less friendly toward big business, and toward rich people,"" economist Peter St. Onge told Fox News Digital in a May phone interview. ""What's actually been happening is that the Fed has been driving income inequality. And, I think for a long time, Republicans were sort of in denial – not just Republicans, but sort of free market types were in denial – and they didn't want to talk about income equality.""
""I think they should absolutely talk about it, because what's causing it is not free markets,"" he said. ""It's something that I think everybody should oppose, which is government manipulation of the monetary system.""
St. Onge was reacting to data showing that billionaires' share of the GDP increased from 14.1% in 2020 to 21.1% in 2025, as reported by Johns Hopkins economistSteve Hanke.
JPMorgan Chase’s private bank estimated that the number of billionaires in the U.S. increased from 1,400 in 2021 to nearly 2,000 as of 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported in April.
DOGE SHOULD 'DEFINITELY' LOOK AT FEDERAL RESERVE COSTS, ELON MUSK SAYS

The Federal Reserve is America's central bank, which sets monetary policies and oversees banks. It acts independently, meaning it does not require approval from the president or Congress when enacting policies.
St. Onge explained to Fox News Digital that ""debt is a rich man's game"" and that billionaires have benefited financially since the pandemic as the Fed worked to ""manipulate interest rates"" down below market value, which subsidized loans.
""During COVID, you could get a mortgage for, you know, three, three and a half percent, when inflation was running higher than that,"" he explained. ""You were literally being paid to borrow money, which is not a free market outcome.… So it makes loans cheap and the rich overwhelmingly borrow money.""
ELON MUSK WARNS FEDERAL RESERVE MAY FACE DOGE AUDIT
The average debt for the top 5% of Americans sits at about $600,000, he said, while the average debt for the vast majority of Americans is roughly $74,000.
""That's about a nine times difference,"" he said of the data. ""So if you make loans too cheap, you are giving nine times more money to rich people.… If you make loans cheap, you're functionally giving $9 to rich people for every $1 to give everybody else.""
Assets are even more skewed, he explained, with the top 5% of Americans holding $7.8 million in assets compared to the average American's $62,000 – notching 130 times the difference between the two demographics, he said.
""The value of a stock or even a house are based on the future stream of income, and those are all discounted by the interest rate,"" he said. ""And so pretty close to mechanically, if you cut interest rates in half – long-term interest rates – you are doubling the value of stocks.""
The nation's wealthiest residents saw their billions grow even larger in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic due to policies from the Federal Reserve that have deepened the chasm of income inequality, economic experts report.(Jason Reed/File Photo/Reuters)
St. Onge pointed to theAmerican economyin the 1970s and the early 2000s, outlining that growth ""took a big step down"" in the 2000s while asset values, such as housing prices and the stock market, skyrocketed.
""The reason is because, since the 1970s, the Fed has very aggressively held rates low, and so this has caused all those assets to go up. So stocks have gone up, housing has gone up. And again, those are rich men's games. Overwhelmingly, people who own stocks are rich. Housing is even more skewed.""
""So if you've got a nine times difference on loans between the bottom 50% and the top 5%, and then you've got 130 times on assets, then the Fed manipulating rates down – they're not doing it to make rich people rich, hopefully – but that's sort of the consequence of doing that,"" he said. ""Holding long-term interest rates low is to shower money on rich people and to shower it in proportion to which they're rich, right? So the most extreme version of that is going to be billionaires.""
FEDERAL RESERVE HOLDS KEY INTEREST RATE STEADY AMID ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY
Economist Steve Hanke discussed how the Federal Reserve has fanned the flame of income inequality through its policies at a conference earlier in 2025 at the Mises Institute, an economics-focused think tank based out of Alabama.
""In 2020, billionaires' share of GDP was 14.1%. Now, it's 21.1%. The Fed increased the money supply, asset prices went up, & guess who owns the assets? Billionaires. By ignoring the money supply, the Fed is an ENGINE OF INCOME INEQUALITY,"" he posted to X inApril of his findings.
The Federal Reserve acts independently, meaning it does not require approval from President Donald Trump or Congress when enacting policies.(Alex Brandon/The Associated Press)
""Take the Federal Reserve’s excessive money printing during the pandemic,""Hanke said in an interviewpublished by the think tank in April. ""The transmission mechanism of monetary policy roughly dictates that changes in the money supply are followed by changes in asset prices in 1–9 months’ time, changes in real economic activity in 6–18 months’ time, and finally changes in the price level in 12–24 months’ time.""
""Thanks to the Fed’s helicopter money drops beginning with COVID, the annual growth rate of the US broad money supply peaked at 18.1% per year in May 2021,"" he added. ""Lo and behold, the transmission mechanism followed – the S&P 500 reached a local maximum in December 2021 (6 months later), and inflation peaked at 9.1% per year in July 2022 (14 months later).""

The result, he said, was skyrocketing wealth inequality to the tune of billionaires increasing their share of the GDP by 7.6 percentage points in just four years.
St. Onge said the Fed's policies have been political in nature, while remarking he would welcome ""naive"" Democrats who bang the proverbial campaign drum of income inequality to jump onto the ""end the Fed bandwagon.""
""They have a naive argument where they look at rich people and they say, ‘Hey, this is so terrible. We live in this dog-eat-dog jungle of an economy,'"" St. Onge said of Democrats who campaign on income inequality. ""And that is inaccurate,"" he added, citing Federal Reserve policies that have amplified income inequality.
On the opposite side of the political coin, Vice PresidentJD Vancehas railed against the Biden administration and ""Wall Street barons"" for policies he said have hurt the working class. During his acceptance speech after officially becoming the vice presidential nominee in July, Vance said an affordability crisis is strangling the working class, while touting that theTrump administrationwould end economic ""catering to Wall Street.""

""Wall Street barons crashed the economy and American builders went out of business,"" Vance said from Milwaukee in summer 2024. ""As tradesmen scrambled for jobs, houses stopped being built. The lack of good jobs, of course, led to stagnant wages. And then the Democrats flooded this country with millions of illegal aliens. So citizens had to compete – with people who shouldn't even be here – for precious housing. Joe Biden's inflation crisis, my friends, is really an affordability crisis.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/americas-last-frontier-our-most-strategic-investment,America's 'Last Frontier' is our most strategic investment,"Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy reacts to President Trump's call for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund and ways it could potentially benefit the American people.
America’s economic future hinges onenergy security, supply chain resilience, and strategic investment in infrastructure. As global markets shift and federal policymakers seek solutions to boost U.S. competitiveness, Alaska has implemented policies that enhance economic resilience, attract investment, and solidify our role as a key driver of national growth.
Under theBiden administration, burdensome regulations and restrictive permitting processes hindered growth, deterring investment and delaying key infrastructure projects. However, with the Trump administration once again acting as a force multiplier for economic expansion, Alaska is making tremendous strides to unlock its full potential.
Alaska’s competitive advantagesare rooted in a framework designed to ensure responsible resource development while prioritizing economic growth. Our vast reserves of oil, gas, timber, and minerals provide reliable access to critical resources essential to manufacturing, defense, and technology industries.
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S ALASKA PIPELINE COULD FUEL AMERICA'S ENERGY NEEDS AND HIS LEGACY
Since theTrump administrationtook office, Alaska has made significant progress in streamlining permitting processes, reducing bureaucratic obstacles that have historically stifled investment. The Alaska LNG project, a cornerstone of our long-term energy strategy, is now advancing with critical federal approvals, allowing us to bring American natural gas to global markets including Japan, the Philippines, and Taiwan, which recently signed a letter of intent to purchase LNG.
Trade and economic expansion reinforce Alaska’s role as a national asset. From 2013 to 2022, Alaska’s imports surged by 164 percent, increasing from $1.4 billion to $3.7 billion, while exports rose by 24 percent, from $4.5 billion to $5.6 billion. The result is a $1.9 billion trade surplus, underscoring the state’s growing importance in global commerce. Additionally, Alaska’s economy has grown more than 40 percent since 2000, with GDP rising from $38.5 billion to $54.1 billion in 2023.
Infrastructure investment further enhances Alaska’s ability to compete in the global economy, as we work to modernize ports, airports, and broadband networks. Thefederal government’srenewed focus on reshoring supply chains underscores the importance of states like Alaska that have the capacity and natural resources to support domestic production. In response, our administration has actively worked to secure federal funding for infrastructure projects that will improve transportation networks and connectivity, ensuring that businesses investing in Alaska have the logistical support they need to thrive.
Alaska is uniquely positioned to meet growing national demands for space access and missile defense, thanks in large part to the Alaska Aerospace Corporation (AAC). Operating the Pacific Spaceport Complex on Kodiak Island, one of only four vertical orbital launch sites in the U.S., AAC offers unmatched capabilities for hypersonic system testing and secure space launch in a low-congestion environment. With its vast geography, strategic location, and proven expertise, Alaska is primed to expand its role in strengthening America's space and defense infrastructure.
Alaska is also emerging as a prime location for data center development, offering a unique opportunity for domestic and international companies seeking secure, energy-efficient locations for digital infrastructure. With a cool climate that reduces cooling costs, abundant renewable and conventional energy sources, and proximity to both U.S. and international markets, Alaska is an ideal location for data centers that require reliability, security, and sustainability.
Workforce development initiatives are expanding to ensure that Alaskans have access to high-paying jobs in emerging industries, from energy to advanced manufacturing. By partnering with industry leaders and educational institutions, we are creating pathways for skills training and certification programs that align with the needs of modern industries. This commitment to workforce readiness is critical in ensuring that Alaska’s economy remains competitive and that opportunities created through resource development directly benefit our residents.

Unlike restrictive mandates that stifle innovation, our approach, The Alaska Standard balances resource development with conservation, ensuring long-term sustainability while maximizing economic opportunity. This model reinforces that responsible development and environmental stewardship can coexist, benefiting both present and future generations. Our constitutionally protected Permanent Fund Dividend is a direct example of how Alaska ensures that the benefits of resource development flow directly to its people rather than enriching foreign adversaries.

Alaska is taking decisive action to enhance economic vitality and competitiveness. Whether through energy, mining, technology, aerospace or infrastructure, we are creating an environment where investment is not only welcomed but encouraged. The progress being made today is a testament to what is possible when state and federal policies align to support innovation, growth, and opportunity.
With a renewed commitment to these principles, Alaska is helping to shape the next chapter of America’s economic success.

Longtime fraud risk expert Linda Miller was cautiously optimistic in an interview that aired Sunday about theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE), though she emphasized that the need to stop government fraud is not political.
""I really think fraud is not a political issue. This is mom and apple pie stuff,"" Miller told ""60 Minutes."" ""We all agree that bad actors should not be stealing American taxpayer dollars. But now, it's become political. People like me, and people in the law enforcement community, we see the adversary, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as foreign adversarial nation-states and organized crime rings.""
She added, ""And I believe that there's opportunities for DOGE to save a lot of significant money, if they focus on the right things, if they focus on real fraud.""

However, Miller clarified that DOGE and DOGE founderElon Musktended to equate ""fraud"" with ""wasteful spending,"" which she pointed out were two separate issues.
""You may not agree withwhat USAID does, you may not want to be investing American dollars in, you know, foreign fertilizer, for example — you may think that's the wrong thing to be spending money on, but that's not fraud,"" Miller said.
During the ""60 Minutes"" segment, correspondent Cecilia Vega spoke to experts like Miller, who argued that hundreds of billions of dollars in fraud were caused not solely by people falsely taking disability benefits, but also by international crime rings from hostile nations like Russia or China, through such actions as stealing government funds from disaster assistance.

Though she said the ""jury’s still out"" on whether DOGE has been effective in combating fraud, Miller said she saw signs that it was addressing the right issues.
""To be honest, Elon Musk coming out and saying, ‘There is a huge amount of fraud,’ I welcome that message completely because, finally, someone is actually saying this,"" Miller said.
Last month, Musk and DOGE volunteer Antonio Gracias identifiedmore than 2 million noncitizenswho were issued Social Security numbers in FY2024.

At the dawn of what was billed as a new American ""Golden Age,"" PresidentDonald Trumpstood before the nation and proclaimed, ""The American Dream will soon be back and thriving like never before.""
That was January 20, 2025. Now, just a few months into this new chapter, it's worth asking: What does a thriving American Dream actually require? It’s not built on speeches or slogans, but on the everyday systems that support working families — schools, hospitals, firehouses and other vital services that keep our communities strong and our local economies growing.
Take a walk through any thriving town or city in America. You will find not just businesses booming and cranes dotting the skyline. You'll find hospitals staffed by highly skilled nurses, public schools filled with ambitious children, public health departments tracking outbreaks before they spread and fire departments ready to respond within minutes.
TRUMP ADMIN REINSTATES 9/11 SURVIVORS PROGRAM STAFF FOLLOWING HHS REORGANIZATION PLAN
You'll also find community colleges and public universities acting as launch pads for young adults entering the workforce. These are not just services. They are the living, breathing organs of a healthy, functioning economy.
Fire departments and other first responders are the backbone of a functioning society.
This isn’t just theory. It’s personal. My mother, a retired NICU nurse, spent decades caring for the smallest lives at Jackson Memorial Hospital inMiami. She was a proud member of SEIU Local 1991. Like many Jamaican-American women in healthcare, she wasn’t just a registered nurse — she was a community builder, a public servant and the backbone of our neighborhood.Her union carddidn’t just signify fair pay; it represented dignity, stability and a stake in America’s future.
Policymakers across the political spectrum often talk about revitalizing American industry and rebuilding the middle class. Many Americans — especially those in the political middle, who feel disconnected from the extremes of both parties — are simply looking for practical solutions. They’re not chasing culture wars or partisan fights; they want what works:good jobs, strong schools, and safe, stable communities.
But manufacturing doesn’t happen in a vacuum. You can’t build a factory in a town where the hospital has closed, the school is underfunded, the firehouse is short-staffed, and the technical college has shuttered because of federal budget cuts. Just ask any titan of industry.
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there were 449,000 job openings in the manufacturing sector as of March 2025. These are real jobs that require real people with real skills. Yet, we lack the workforce to fill them. Why? Because we’ve spent the past decade underfunding the very institutions that grow, train and sustain that workforce.
One bipartisan bright spot iscareer and technical education (CTE).As a recent New York Times opinion piece by AFT President Randi Weingarten highlighted, CTE is having a moment. Bringing together leaders like Independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, Education Secretary Linda McMahon and business leaders like Satya Nadella, theCEO of Microsoft, CTE could catalyze the kind of revitalization many Americans are calling for.
To make that a reality, it must expand with the support of our most significant national resource: the federal government. A robust, federally supported career and technical education system could help resolve nursing shortages, address crises in emergency services and build a new generation of skilled tradespeople. But education doesn’t just begin at age 18.
Public schools are the first rung on the ladder. Yet, under the latest federal budget proposal, funding forpublic K-12 schoolsis set to take a massive hit. One billion dollars for student mental health services? Gone. Programs aimed at closing achievement gaps and supporting students with disabilities? Slashed.
This isn’t belt-tightening. This is misaligned priority-setting.
Education remains an essential part of a successful economy. And career and technical education has bipartisan support.(iStock)
Our schools are already overwhelmed. Teachers are leaving the profession in droves. School nurses, counselors and support staff are being cut or forced to cover multiple roles. In some districts, students show up to class hungry, traumatized and with nowhere to turn. And the federal government’s answer is to cut more?
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
We can’t build a 21st Century workforce without 21st Century schools. We can’t have a strong manufacturing base without strong community colleges. We can’t train the next generation of emergency responders if we’re defunding the very programs that would prepare them. A factory job may require technical skill, but the journey to that skill begins in a kindergarten classroom.
When some lawmakers talk about ""freedom,"" they often forget that freedom is meaningless without infrastructure. What good is the freedom to choose your doctor if there are no doctors in your town? What does school choice mean if your local public school is being bled dry by underinvestment and neglect?
America’s prosperity has always rested on a simple formula: invest in people, invest in places, and the profits will follow. The towns that are thriving today are those that never stopped believing in that equation. They fought to keep their schools open, their hospitals staffed, their libraries funded and their civic fabric intact.
But manufacturing doesn’t happen in a vacuum. You can’t build a factory in a town where the hospital has closed, the school is underfunded, the firehouse is short-staffed, and the technical college has shuttered because of federal budget cuts. Just ask any titan of industry.
If we truly want to restore American greatness, we must recognize that it isn’t built solely on tax breaks andtariffs. It’s built in the maternity wards, classrooms, firehouses and community colleges that serve as the foundation of working-class life.

Cutting for the sake of cutting isn’t policy. It’s performance art. And forworking familieslike the one I grew up in, it’s not just shortsighted — it’s dangerous.
To restore the American Dream, we need more than rhetoric. We need reinvestment. In schools. In hospitals. In people. In hope. That’s the kind of manufacturing America still knows how to do — and it starts right in our backyard.

Americans from all over the country are still coming to terms with PresidentDonald Trump’s tariffs on imports, though many are acknowledging that they’re willing to pay more for American products.
Fox News Digital spoke to everyday Americans in Washington, D.C., New York City, Knoxville, Tennessee, and other major U.S. cities to find out if they’d be willing to pay more for American products or go with less to allow for Trump’s tariffs to reset America’s trade deals throughout the world. Many of those interviewed said yes.
""Oh, 100%. I don't like to spend money and buy goods outside the USA because I'm also then supporting child labor and forced labor conditions that are unethical, normally,"" Lyndsey from Birmingham, Michigan, said when asked if she’d spend more on products made in America.

Other Americans gave similar answers to the question.
""Yeah, absolutely,"" Joe from Boston said. ""You know, I mean, I'm pro-conservative, so anything that's going to build the economy here in America, yes, I would.""
Zharko in Michigan told Fox, ""Absolutely, because we make the best. We just, nobody realized that. And it's about time.""
Ray in New York City said he’d pay more for American-made, so long as ""it’s a higher quality than I can get somewhere else.""
Mark, who was visiting D.C., told Fox, ""Absolutely. We've talked about it a lot, and I think it's a temporary pain for good pay-off in the future, I think.""

However, D.C. resident Tamara said she liked the idea in principle, but disagreed with it because Trump has been promoting it.
""I am pro-America. I do like made-in-American products. But considering today's climate and where it's coming from, I'm not really a fan,"" she said.
Bill, a Republican voter visiting D.C., disagreed with the idea of paying more for American-made, telling Fox, ""I think that's not a good policy. I mean, if America's going to compete with the rest of the world, it's got to compete on prices. I'm all for free markets.""
Fox also asked these people what they thought of Trump’s recent statement that kids may have to deal withhaving less toysbecause of his reciprocal tariffs on Chinese goods. Trump told reporters last weekend, ""All I’m saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old girl, 9-year-old girl, 15-year-old girl, doesn’t need 37 dolls.""
He also told NBC News anchorKristen Welkerin a recent interview, ""I don’t think that a beautiful baby girl needs — that’s 11 years old — needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three dolls or four dolls because what we were doing with China was just unbelievable.""

The interview subjects were more mixed in their answers to this question. Knoxville resident Jay said, ""I would agree. I think today's society has a sense of entitlement, and I think that's where he's really going with that. Like, instead of having multiple things that you really don't need, you can do with less, and we can teach our kids to do with less maybe.""
Lyndsey from Birmingham agreed, saying, ""I 100% agree with that. I think we need to be a less consumeristic style society and more of an organic, back-to-nature society where we're buying back from our farmers, we're getting everything locally sourced, and we're kind of building back a better community of just keeping things, the goods and services within a small community of places.""
Sergio, a Mexican man living in Tennessee, agreed with Trump’s statements, but turned them around on the president, saying, ""It's true, we don't need so many, but at the same time, Trump doesn't need so many millions, and he has a lot of millions. So why he doesn't give up some of those millions?""
Tamara in D.C. didn’t like Trump’s point.
""It's funny that he's the party of freedom, but he wants to tell us how we are to spend for our children, and I just don't think that's right,"" she said.

One ofPresident Donald Trump's most significant achievementsduring his first 100 days in office was his executive order requiring ""radical"" healthcare price transparency. The order doubles down on his first-term hospital and health insurance price transparency rules requiring the publication of actual prices of care and coverage, including discounted cash and negotiated insurance rates.
This informationprotects patients from overchargesand empowers them to reduce inflated costs through choice and competition. The executive order requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Department of Labor (DOL), and the Department of the Treasury to issue rules strengthening, standardizing and enforcing systemwide price transparency by the end of this month.
Trump's healthcare price transparency effort will revolutionize healthcareand the entire economy.It's a pro-worker, pro-growth, free-market policy to boost worker paychecks and business earnings.
5.5 MILLION PATIENTS' INFORMATION EXPOSED BY MAJOR HEALTHCARE DATA BREACH
When employers and unions can access actual prices throughout the healthcare system, they can spot wide price variations for the same care, expose middle players driving up costs and design affordable health plans. They can share their savings with workers in the form of lower premiums and higher wages.

Under the status quo, healthcare is fundamentally un-American. It is the only economic sector where consumers cannot see real prices before they buy.
No functioning market can exist under these conditions. As a result, prices for the same care can range by 10 times, even at the same hospital.
For instance, C-sections varyfrom $6,000 to $60,000and MRIs from $450 to $6,500. That isn't a marketplace — it's Russian Roulette that allows Big Health to profiteer off patients' misery.
For decades, health insurers have hidden prices and claims information, facilitating spread pricing that robs workers and employers. Employer-sponsored family health plans now cost $25,600 annually and increase by double-digits each year. Research shows that about the same amount of compensation gains for average workers since 2000 has gone to premiums as paychecks, a major cause of wage stagnation.
Unfortunately, hospitals and health insurers haven't complied with Trump's first-term rules. According to a recent study by PatientRightsAdvocate.org, only 21.1% of hospitals nationwide are fully complying with the hospital rule.
The Biden administration didn't meaningfully enforce the rule, issuing only 25 financial penalties on the thousands of hospitals that didn't comply. Biden also rolled back the rule, allowing the posting of unaccountable estimates in lieu of actual prices needed to shop. And health insurers have buried their data disclosures in massive files full of meaningless ""ghost codes"" that crash computers and are nearly impossible to parse.

Trump's new order increases enforcement to boost compliance, requires actual prices — not estimates — so patients can shop with financial certainty, expands transparency requirements throughout the healthcare system, and standardizes data disclosures, so consumers can make meaningful price comparisons. It gives people prices before they receive care.
Trump's order will also enact overdue requirements for health insurers to provide Advanced Explanations of Benefits (AEOBs), required by the bipartisan No Surprises Act that passed at the end of 2020. AEOBs let patients know exactly what they'll owe — including their out-of-pocket patient responsibility — giving them financial peace of mind.
Under the status quo, healthcare is fundamentally un-American. It is the only economic sector where consumers cannot see real prices before they buy.
They also empower employers and unions to audit their health plans and verify claims payments match provider bills and posted prices. Employers and unions can then eliminate spread pricing that — as the New York Times reported last year — often requires their health plans to pay far more to middle players than providers.
Drawing on a JAMA study concluding that 25% of U.S. healthcare spending ($4.9 trillion in 2023) is waste, overcharges, and fraud, economists estimate systemwide price transparency can generate approximately $1 trillion of savings. Putting $1 trillion a year in overbilling back into the productive economy, including worker paychecks and business investment, will result in an enormous annual economic stimulus.

Healthcare price transparency is the most important microeconomic reform in American history. It creates a functional, competitive marketplace that restores choice, accountability and trust. When prices are clear, markets work. When markets work, costs fall. And when costs fall, wages rise.
President Trump's executive order — and the ensuing federal rules issued later in May —will finally make healthcare price transparency a reality. They will solidify Trump's legacy as the president who fixed American healthcare.

House Republicans released a portion of PresidentDonald Trump’stax agenda late on Friday evening, bringing them one step closer to completing the commander-in-chief’s ""big, beautiful bill.""
The legislation includes an increased child tax credit (CTC), a higher threshold for estate tax liability – what Republicans have referred to as the ""death tax"" – and several other measures.
It also lays the groundwork for making Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) permanent. Republican leaders had warned that failing to do so would lead to a tax increase of over 20% for millions of Americans, if TCJA were allowed to expire at the end of this year.
There is no information in the bill so far about state and local tax (SALT) deduction caps, which have been asignificant point of contentionbetween blue state Republicans critical to keeping the House majority, and GOP lawmakers from deeper red, lower-tax states.

Another notable exclusion is anew millionaires’ tax bracket.Trump had floated the idea of a small tax increase on the ultra-wealthy, and a source familiar with his thinking told Fox News Digital earlier this week that Trump was considering allowing a pre-TCJA 2.6% tax hike on people making $2.5 million per year or more.
Those measures and others are not necessarily excluded from the final bill, however.
The legislation is also expected to include new Trump tax pledges like eliminating taxes on tips, overtime wages and Social Security checks for retirees.
More elements are expected to be added in the coming days via amendments. The full legislation is expected to advance through the Ways & Means Committee, the House’s tax-writing panel, on Tuesday afternoon.
Release of the legislation is a major sign of progress for House GOP leaders, who had been forced to punt their initial planned deadline of having a bill on Trump’s desk by sometime between Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.
But SALT deduction caps and a millionaire’s tax hike are two of the most volatile discussion points.
House Ways & Means Committee Chair Jason Smith said his panel will advance the bill on Tuesday.(Tom Williams)
House Republicans currently have a razor-thin three-vote margin, meaning they can afford to have little dissent and still pass anything without Democratic support.
They’re hoping to do just that, with virtually no Democrats currently on board with Trump’s massive Republican policy overhaul.
Republican lawmakers are working to pass their legislation via the budget-reconciliation process, which lowers the Senate’s passage threshold from 60 votes to 51, lining up the House’s own simple majority threshold.
Reconciliation allows the party in power to effectively skirt the minority and pass broad pieces of legislation – provided they address taxes, spending or the national debt.
Trump wants Republicans to use the maneuver to tackle his priorities on the border, immigration, taxes, defense, energy, and raising the debt ceiling.
BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY
Both the House and Senate passed frameworks setting the stage for the bill earlier this year.
Now, the relevant committees of jurisdiction on either side must craft policy in line with that framework, before all the parts are fitted into a final bill that must again pass both houses of Congress before being signed into law by Trump.
The most recent portion released by the House Ways & Means Committee would increase the current maximum CTC from $2,000 to $2,500.
It would also boost the maximum deduction for qualified business income, a tax provision known as 199A, from 20% to 22%. That would largely affect small business owners whose entities are taxed under individual income tax rates.
On the estate tax, which is levied on assets after person's death, it raises the exemption level to $15 million from the current level of roughly $13.9 million.

Republicans havelong criticized the estate taxas a needless financial burden on grieving families, particularly hitting small family-owned businesses. Supporters of the federal estate tax point out that it affects a relatively small number of estates.
""Seven years ago, the Trump tax cuts sparked an economic boom and provided needed relief to working families. Pro-family, pro-worker tax provisions are the heart of President Trump’s economic agenda that puts working families ahead of Washington and will create jobs, grow wages and investment and help usher in a new golden age of prosperity,"" House Ways & Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said in a statement on Friday night.

A federal judge on Friday issued a temporary pause on the Trump administration’s plans to restructure various government agencies and cut tens of thousands of federal workers because the government overhaul was notauthorized by Congress.
U.S. District Judge Susan Illston put a 14-day pause on the mass layoffs, siding with a group of unions, non-profits and local governments after they filed a lawsuit on April 28.
Illston said Trump may broadly restructure federal agencies, but only in ""lawful ways"" with approval from Congress.
""The President has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch,"" Illston said. ""Many presidents have sought this cooperation before; many iterations of Congress have provided it.""

""Nothing prevents the President from requesting this cooperation—as he did in his prior term of office,"" the judge continued. ""Indeed, the Court holds the President likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime.""
Illston's ruling was the broadest of its kind against administration efforts to overhaul the federal government, which have been led byElon Muskand the Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE.
Fox News Digital has reached out to the White House for comment.
In February, Trump directed agencies towork with DOGEto identify targets for mass layoffs as part of the administration's plans to restructure the government.

The president instructed agencies to eliminate duplicate roles, unnecessary management layers and non-critical jobs, as well as to automate routine tasks, close regional field offices and reduce the use of outside contractors.
The group of plaintiffs said the administration's ""unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation.""
""Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government – laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that,"" the groups said in a statement.
Illston scheduled a hearing for May 22 for a potential longerpreliminary injunction.She said plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm without the temporary restraining order, which she said preserves the status quo.

The judge said the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of some of their claims. They accuse Trump of exceeding his authority and say that DOGE, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management exceeded their authority and violated administrative law.

Barron pointed out that Leo XIII was a pivotal figure due to the timing of his reign, which came during a moment whenthe Churchwas contending with the tremendous political and philosophical upheavals of the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the French and American Revolutions, and the introduction of philosophies such as Marxism.
""The church's first reaction [to these changes] was very negative. It was a great ‘no’ to modernity. By the end of the 19th century, I think, with a certain distance and a certain critical intelligence, the church was willing to enter into a more, call it, creative engagement with modernity. And I think Pope Leo the 13th represents precisely that,"" Barron said.
The bishop pointed to the Rerum Novarum to further his point, an encyclical letter issued by Pope Leo XIII in 1891.

""In that document, [Leo XIII] is a fierce opponent of Marxism, a fierce opponent of socialism and communism, a great defender of private property and of the market economy,"" Barron said. ""So you say, 'Okay, there's that great ‘no’ to the left-wing economic revolutions.' At the same time, in that same letter, [Leo XIII] comes out strongly in favor of the right toform unions.He comes out very strongly in favor of what we call the universal destination of goods.""

""In fact, Pope Leo says in that letter, once the requirements of necessity and propriety have been met in your life, the rest of what you own belongs to the poor,"" Barron continued. ""That's not a just a standard, boring, mainstream point of view. That's a pretty revolutionary statement. But notice the lovely balance in that letter between ‘yes’ to private property, the great ‘no’ to socialism and Marxism, but the great ‘yes’ to the universal destination of goods. Leo sets the tone thereby for the rest ofCatholic social teachingthat followed him.""
In conclusion, Barron said he thinks Prevost's selection of Leo XIV makes the new pope ""a very interesting player"" in terms of the debate between the Right and the Left in politics.

""[Leo XIV] doesn't fit – and I've said this 1,000 times – he and other great representatives of Catholic social teaching don't fit into our categories of left and right,"" Barron said. ""They don't fit into Democrat-Republican, they're in a space beyond those distinctions. So, I think that's what's perhaps most interesting about him.""",5/9/2025

As Republicans search for avenues to extend PresidentDonald Trump's2017 tax cuts, some Republican lawmakers involved in the process have floated the idea that the nation's highest earners could see a tax increase in order to usher in cuts for lower-earners.
For his part, the president is sending signals he tends to agree.
""You know, they'll go around saying, ‘Oh, this is so terrible.’ What you're doing is you're giving up something up top in order to make people in the middle income and the lower income brackets save more. So it's really a redistribution,"" Trump told reporters when asked what his response would be to those Republicans opposed totax increaseson the wealthy.
""I would love to be able to give people in a lower bracket a big break by giving up some of what I have,"" the president added.

""A lot of people say, don't do it because of the fact that you have the Bush statement about ‘Read my lips.’ But he lost because of Ross Perot, he didn't lose because of that statement,"" Trump said. ""I actually think it's good politics to do it where richer people give up. And it's a very small – it's like a point – but they give it up to benefit the people on lower income.""
TRUMP PUSHES TAX HIKES FOR WEALTHY AS ‘BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL’ DEADLINE LOOMS
In a post on his Truth Social platform earlier Friday, Trump struck a slightly more cautious tone about the alleged concern that his willingness to increase taxes on the highest earners could spell trouble for him electorally the way it did for Bush Sr.
He complained that Democrats would point to it repeatedly in an effort to discredit him. However, Trump still contended that the elder President Bush lost because of more than just his broken tax promises, and added that while Republicans should probably not increase taxes on the wealthy, he would be okay with it if they were to do so.

Discussions over apotential tax hikefor ultra-wealthy Americans are threatening to foment a civil war among Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Some GOP lawmakers, as well as conservative groups that are frequently in touch with congressional Republicans, have been loudly voicing opposition to any tax increases.
Meanwhile PresidentDonald Trumpand his allies are signaling that the idea could be a way to pay for significant tax breaks targeting middle and working-class Americans.
""Raising taxes on one bracket is a slippery slope. What will stop future tax increases on middle-income earners as the federal government accumulates more and more debt?"" a senior House GOP aide told Fox News Digital. ""Republicans certainly shouldn’t be the party leading this effort.""

But the ideafound support amongmore populist Trump allies like House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md.
""Personally, I’ve always believed that if we can’t find spending reductions elsewhere, we should look at restoring the [pre-2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)] tax bracket on million dollar income to help pay for the President’s agenda,"" Harris wrote on X.
It comes after Trump signaled to GOP leaders that he was open to raising taxes on the ultra-wealthy to offset the cost of new policies eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and retirees' social security.
A source familiar with the president's thinking told Fox News Digital that to accomplish those goals, as well as preserving Medicaid for millions, Trump is considering a new top income tax bracket of 39.6% for single taxpayers making $2.5 million or more per year.
The TCJA lowered the tax rate for the top income bracket — currently $609,350 for single filers — to 37%, a cut that's expiring at the end of this year.
Trump himself toyed with the idea publicly on Truth Social Friday morning, though made clear he saw the potential drawbacks.
""The problem with even a ‘TINY’ tax increase for the RICH, which I and all others would graciously accept in order to help the lower and middle income workers, is that the Radical Left Democrat Lunatics would go around screaming, ‘Read my lips,’ the fabled Quote by George Bush the Elder that is said to have cost him the Election,"" Trump posted, referencing ill-fated comments by late formerPresident George H.W. Bush.

Discussions about raising taxes have traditionally been anathema to mainstream Republican beliefs.
But it's now a direction the GOP will have to contend with as Trump continues to bring more middle- and working-class people into the party base – but disagreements on the wisdom of such a move remain.
""'Tax the rich' is a tired slogan with no evidence of spurring economic growth, as higher taxes on any group hinder innovation and investment,"" Rep. Eric Burlison, R-Mo., told Fox News Digital on Friday.
""We don't have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem. Ultimately, I don't think this will even happen. We must focus on cutting spending and downsizing government, not raising taxes.""
BROWN UNIVERSITY IN GOP CROSSHAIRS AFTER STUDENT'S DOGE-LIKE EMAIL KICKS OFF FRENZY
Several Republicans told Fox News Digital late last month that they were wary of raising taxes – including Reps. David Kustoff, R-Tenn., and Tim Moore, R-N.C. Spokespeople for both said their opinions are unchanged as of Friday morning.
""When we passed what was called the Tax Cuts Jobs Act of 2017, we did lower taxes for everybody. We reduced the tax rates. We condensed the brackets,"" Kustoff said. ""And what we saw is, that lifted everybody. And the U.S. Treasury still saw revenues continue to grow. So I don't want to see taxes raised on anybody.""
Moore told Fox News Digital, ""I do not support any tax increases. I think that we do not have a revenue problem, we have a spending problem.""
Moreover, nearly 200 past and present House Republicans signed onto a pledge to oppose all tax increases, run by think tank Americans For Tax Reform.
But another Republican, Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., told Fox News Digital that day, ""I would want to see some numbers behind it and how it would have an effect on the economy.""
""What I've heard from people in the upper tax brackets is, you know, they're willing to pay more as long as they know that it's paying the debt down. They don't want to see it go towards more spending,"" Stutzman said.
It's one of several ongoing debates over how to advance Trump's agenda via the budget reconciliation process, which allows the party in power to advance a massive piece of fiscal policy legislation while sidelining the minority by lowering the Senate's threshold for passage from 60 votes to 51.
SENATE GOP PUSHES TRUMP BUDGET FRAMEWORK THROUGH AFTER MARATHON VOTE SERIES
Republicans are working to use the maneuver to advance Trump's priorities on border security, immigration, energy, national defense and taxes, as well as raising the debt ceiling.
On taxes, expected to be the costliest portion, Republicans want to extend Trump's 2017 TCJA cuts expiring in 2026 as well as implement his aforementioned newer policies.
Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., a longtime Trump ally, told Fox Business' Stuart Varney on Friday, ""We are not going to do tax increases.""
But it's not clear how many of those Republicans will change their minds if Trump begins exerting pressure on such tax hikes.
Meanwhile, conservative groups like The Heritage Foundation and Americans For Prosperity (AFP) are already exerting pressure on Capitol Hill to resist any tax hikes.

""The sooner Republicans can get back to this broad consensus – keeping taxes low, while cutting wasteful spending – the sooner they’ll all start to see the benefits, both economically and politically.""
The House Ways & Means Committee is expected to meet on Tuesday to advance the tax portion of the package, so its details – including the potential tax hike – will be released in the coming days.
Republican leaders hope to have a bill passed in the House of Representatives by around Memorial Day, with a final bill on Trump's desk by the Fourth of July.
With razor-thin margins in the House and Senate, the GOP can afford precious little dissent if they are going to meet their goals.

As of April 5, the U.S. has imposed a 10% reciprocal tariff on imports from the U.K.
The Trump administration’s 25% global tariff on cars took effect on April 3, impacting all imported vehicles, even from traditional U.S. allies, including the U.K. A 25% tariff on U.S. imports of steel, aluminum and derivative products took effect on March 12.
Prior to April 2025, most U.K. goods exported to the U.S. were subject to standard, relatively low tariffs, mostly ranging from 0 to 2.5%, with higher rates only for specific products like steel, aluminum, and some vehicles. The U.K., meanwhile, imposed tariffs on U.S. imports based on the World Trade Organization’s ""Most Favored Nation"" or MFN rules.

The U.K.’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 3.8% in 2023, according to the most recent data available.

Sparks are flying over taxes that primarily affect Republicans representing districts in Democrat-controlled states, sending tensions skyrocketing as GOP lawmakers negotiate PresidentDonald Trump's""big, beautiful bill.""
The fight more specifically is about state and local tax deductions, colloquially known as SALT.
Republican lawmakers representing high-cost-of-living areas outside big cities had been pushing leaders to raise the current cap on SALT deductions – $10,000 for both single filers and married couples – in Trump's bill.
However, on Thursday night, leaders of the House's SALT Caucus emphatically rejected what they said was an offer from GOP leaders to raise that deduction to $30,000.

""We've negotiated in good faith on SALT from the start— fighting for the taxpayers we represent in New York. Yet with no notice or agreement, the Speaker and the House Ways and Means Committee unilaterally proposed a flat $30,000 SALT cap — an amount they already knew would fall short of earning our support,"" the statement said.
""It's not just insulting — it risks derailing President Trump'sOne Big Beautiful Bill.New Yorkers already send far more to Washington than we get back — unlike many so-called ‘low-tax’ states that depend heavily on federal largesse. A higher SALT cap isn't a luxury. It's a matter of fairness. We reject this offer.""
The statement was signed by Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., Nick LaLota, R-N.Y., Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y.
However, not all of their delegation is on board.
Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., whose district spans a sliver of south Brooklyn and all of Staten Island, told Fox News Digital first that she could support a $30,000 cap.
""Everyone needs to advocate for the needs of their district. Tripling the deduction to $30,000 will provide much-needed relief for the middle-class and cover 98% of the families in my district,"" she said.
However, a spokesperson for Johnson pointed out that there was no commitment made on any number.
Press secretary Athina Lawson wrote on X alongside a report that Johnson ""acknowledged"" the $30,000 number, ""To add vital, missing context: What the Speaker actually said is this is one number among others in ongoing discussions amongst members.""

She referenced comments Johnson made to reporters on Thursday when asked about the figure. ""I’ve heard that number, and I’ve heard others as well.""
""It’s still an ongoing discussion amongst the members,"" Johnson said. ""I’m not going to handicap it because I’m not sure exactly what that is, but there’s a lot of analysis that’s going into it.""
The Republican majorities in the House and Senate are working on advancing Trump's agenda via thebudget reconciliation process,which allows the party in power to move a massive piece of legislation without the opposing party's input, provided it deals with budgetary and other fiscal matters.
It is a massive effort across multiple committees of jurisdiction.
The Ways & Means Committee, the House's tax-writing panel, is expected to unveil its portion of the bill within days.

A meeting to advance that legislation is expected Tuesday afternoon, people familiar with the planning told Fox News Digital.
Malliotakis is the only member of the committee who is also a member of the SALT Caucus.
Republicans in California, New York and New Jersey have been pushing for the reconciliation bill to lift the SALT deduction cap, which was first implemented in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Some lawmakers have proposed lifting the cap to as high as $100,000, which Republicans in other areas have largely rejected.
The blue state Republicans pushing for a larger deduction have argued the issue is critical for their constituents.

They are also the most vulnerable lawmakers in the House GOP Conference, and their seats are key to Republicans holding onto their slim majority.
Republicans in favor of raising the SALT deduction have also pointed out that while it benefits people in high-cost-of-living areas outside big cities, it is those states that send more tax dollars back to Washington for programs that ultimately benefit the entire country.

However, others in conservative circles have pushed back on their efforts.
""The Republican margin is so small in the House that a handful of New England Republicans have a lot of sway over this bill and are pushing to raise that deduction,"" said Marc Short, an alumnus of Trump's first administration who played a key role in the 2017 tax negotiations.
""I think from a tax perspective, what's unfair about that is you're basically taking much of middle America that live in states that are better governed and asking them to subsidize the residents in states that are poorly managed and continue to generate huge deficits.""

Why is it that we still get a tiny thrill fromchecking the mailboxeach day? Rationally, we know what’s in there: bills we don’t want, catalogs we never ordered, and that bulky Valpak stuffed with coupons we’ll never use.
But somehow, despite the noise, there’s aquiet hopewe might find something meaningful. Something personal. Something real. Maybe even a long-lost penpal letter.
And every once in a while, we do.
In a society obsessed with social media, texts, AI, speed and automation, the handwritten thank-you note has become an endangered species. (iStock)
There it is – your name, written in pen. A handwritten envelope. And inside? A genuine thank-you note. No automation. No mass email. Just ink on paper and real human appreciation. That little envelope has the power to elevate your entire day.
WHAT AMERICA’S WORKING CLASS REALLY WANTS, AND WHY POLITICIANS KEEP IGNORING THEM
In a society obsessed with social media, texts, AI, speed and automation, the handwritten thank-you note has become an endangered species. But let me tell you: this lost art isn’t just a sentimental throwback – it’s a powerful tool that canaccelerate your career, grow your business and make you more money.
Why I Write 5 To 10 Thank-You Notes Every Week
For over 25 years, I’ve never stopped writing handwritten thank-you notes. It’s not because I have time to kill – trust me, I don’t. It’s because I’ve seen the ROI firsthand.
When you take five minutes to write a thoughtful message that says, ""I see you, I appreciate you,"" it sticks. It differentiates you. And in business, differentiation is everything.  The whole THX thing on text just isn’t cutting it.
These aren’t generic ""Congrats!"" or ""Well done!"" scribbles. They’re sincere expressions of gratitude – direct, personal, and specific. In today’sdigitally distracted world, the impact of that kind of authenticity is impossible to overstate.
THE IMPENDING AI-DRIVEN JOBLESS ECONOMY: WHO WILL PAY TAXES?
We live in a 24/7, always-on environment where texts, emails and Slack messages fly by faster than most people can process. But when someone receives a handwritten note, they pause. They engage. They remember.
Want to Get Ahead? Start Here.
Let me cut to the chase: if you’re serious about building a successful career, expanding your network, or scaling your business, you need to resurrect this simple practice.
Want to nail the second interview? Want clients to remember you – and refer you? Want to create real centers of influence in your life? Want to build a reputation as someone whogets it? Then start writing thank-you notes.
Why? Because almost no one does it. Yourcompetition is too busy– or too lazy. That means you have a wide-open opportunity to create emotional resonance where others barely make an impression.
THIS IS HOW DONALD TRUMP CAN TERMINATE TARIFF TURMOIL
Recently, I was on former Congresswoman Mary Bono’s podcast ""Sagely Speaking.""  It was humbling to be on the podcast being interviewed by her, but after the podcast I took the time to write a handwritten thank you and send out a small token of my appreciation for having me on the show. These are the small things you can be doing every day to improve your career and increase your bottom line.
Leaders Say ""Please"" and ""Thank You""
You’d be shocked how many people go through their careers expecting things from others without offering even the most basic courtesies. ""Please."" ""Thank you."" Common words, uncommon in practice.
Want to build real loyalty within your team?Start showing appreciation. Say thank you – out loud, in writing, in public. It costs nothing, and it earns everything: trust, morale, retention.
And if you’re a business owner or executive, hear this: culture starts at the top. I lead by example. Since launching my companies more than 18 years ago, I’ve made it a point to write cards every single week. Real cards, with real ink.
3 WAYS TRUMP CAN DELIVER AN ECONOMIC 'GOLDEN AGE' FOR AMERICA
And the response? People – young and old – actually thankmefor sending a thank-you card. That’s not strange. That’s a signal. A signal that in today’s economy, emotional intelligence is as valuable as financial intelligence.
The Hidden Profit in Paper and Ink
Here’s what nobody teaches you inbusiness school: relationships build revenue. Appreciation drives referrals. Consistency earns loyalty.
When you write thank-you notes consistently, you strengthen your reputation, multiply your touchpoints and turn acquaintances into advocates. That translates to better job offers, warmer leads and stronger partnerships. In short – it makes you money.
Try this: commit to writing one handwritten thank-you note per day for a year. That’s 365 notes. Do it with heart. Be specific. Be real. Then sit back and watch what happens.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-trade-deal-uk-ease-economic-jitters-boost-presidents-poll-numbers,Will Trump trade deal with UK ease economic jitters and boost president's poll numbers?,"Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the upcoming trade negotiations with China and President Donald Trump's announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom.
PresidentDonald Trumpis touting that Thursday's announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom – which is the first since the president a month ago announced massive tariffs on nations across the globe – will be ""the first of many.""
Pushing back against descriptions thatthe agreementhammered out between the two historic allies was just an initial deal with much more to be negotiated, Trump argued ""this is a very big deal…this is a maxed-out deal that we're going to make bigger.""
The financial sector appeared to embrace the deal, with the stock markets rising on news of the agreement. However, for a president aiming to pass a sweeping agenda through Congress, it is the political reaction that may be of upmost importance.
Trump's approval ratings have been sliding since he returned to power in the White House three and a half months ago and are now underwater in most national polling.

Fueling the drop in Trump's poll numbers are increased concerns by Americans over the economy and inflation, which were pressing issues that kept former PresidentJoe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency.
Front and center is Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement a month ago, which sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners and triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.
Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president'spoll positionwhen he started his second tour of duty in the White House. An average of the latest national surveys puts the president's approval rating underwater by around six points.
WHERE TRUMP STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS NATIONAL POLL
Trump stood at 44% approval and 55% disapproval in the most recentFox News national poll, which was conducted April 18-21.
Additionally, the president's approval registered at 38% on the economy and just 33% on inflation and tariffs.
(Fox News )
However, veteran Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, when asked about the political impact of Thursday's trade deal, described it as a ""positive first step.""
Williams also noted that Trump’s approval ratings are ""tied directly to the performance of the economy.""

In discussing his tariffs soon after he announced them on what he called ""Liberation Day,"" the president touted that ""these countries are calling us up, kissing my a--.""
""They are dying to make a deal. ‘Please, please, sir, make a deal. I’ll do anything. I’ll do anything, sir!’"" Trump highlighted.

""President Trump has argued that his agenda requires time for an adjustment and deal making. He’ll be given a period of time to execute deals to prove that his plans are working and the first major trade deal with a nation like the UK is at least a sign that some of the work has been going on behind the scenes thus and is starting to bear fruit,"" Williams said.
He added that the president will ""have to back it up with more, but it is a positive first step for him in securing other deals.""

More than 4 million youth and young-adult families facehomelessness,statistics show, prompting rare bipartisan action in Congress to expand federal support and address the growing crisis.
Sens. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., and Katie Britt, R-Ala., will introduce the Homeless Children & Youth Act on Wednesday, which is the former’s first piece of major bipartisan legislation in her short tenure since being sworn-in in January.
Officials must ensure that children experiencing homelessness can get the support they need to exit that situation for good, Alsobrooks told Fox News Digital.
""This legislation will begin to close the barrier to services for many young families and is a true action to one of my guiding principles: 'love your neighbor as yourself.' No person deserves toexperience homelessness,and HCYA is an important step in ending homelessness in our communities and breaking generational cycles,"" she said.

Britt added, ""No child should be prevented from receiving the critical assistance they need,"" and that the bill will ""streamline"" the definition of homelessness across all federal agencies.
The bill seeks to betterdefine homelessnessin a federal context in order to provide fuller resources. In that current code, in some areas of government, it excludes counting youths who stay with people other than their parents or live in motel rooms as experiencing homelessness, while other federal programs consider them so.
It would also ""improve visibility and understanding"" of the issue, as proponents said youth are often overlooked as a bloc of people that can face homelessness.
By standardizing the definition of youth homelessness, and also opening up more federal resources to affected people, the bill will help communities break the cycle, proponents said.

Youth homelessness has been an issue in the Washington, D.C., area, where Alsobrooks led a collar county for several years prior to defeating former Gov. Larry Hogan for her current seat.
During her time as Prince George's County executive, the county established the Youth Action Board, which aims to directly address the crisis from a young person’s perspective.
In 2024, Alsobrooks credited the Department of Housing and Urban Development for an additional $2 million grant to assist organizations in Prince George's that combatyouth homelessness.

In nearby Frederick County, north of the nation’s capital, one homeless assistance group praised the legislation.
""Programs like ours could serve these youth immediately upon experiencing homelessness,"" Melissa Muntz of Student Homelessness Initiative Partnership of Frederick told Fox News Digital.
""Shortening a young person's period of homelessness by providing immediate support increases the likelihood that the youth will remain connected to school,"" Muntz said.
""We know that youth who do not graduate from high school are significantly more likely to experience homelessness as adults, making this an early intervention to prevent adult homelessness.""
At least 15 other homelessness advocacy groups have also endorsed the act, according to its sponsors.

PresidentDonald Trumphas some polling problems with his approval ratings sliding into negative territory since he reentered the White House three and a half months ago. But he's far from alone when it comes to taking a political punch in public opinion.
The opposingDemocratic Party'sfavorable ratings keep sinking to new lows.
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said this past weekend in a ""Fox News Sunday"" interview that the party's focus right now is ""squarely on making sure that we stand up for hardworking Americans who are being left behind in this Trump economy.""
But many Americans apparently don't believe that Democrats are up to the task.

The Democrats' ratings stood underwater in the latest Fox News national poll at 41% favorable and 56% unfavorable in a survey conducted April 18-21.
That's an all-time low for the Democrats in Fox News polling. And for the first time in a decade, the party's standing was lower thanthat of the GOP,which stood at 44% favorable and 54% unfavorable.
The figures were reversed last summer, when Fox News last asked the party favorability question in one of its surveys.

The Fox News poll is far from an outlier.
The Democratic Party's favorable ratings were well in negative territory in a Pew Research national survey - 38% favorable, 60% unfavorable - conducted in early April and at 36% favorable, 60% unfavorable in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field a couple of weeks earlier.
And national polls conducted in February by Quinnipiac University and March by CNN and by NBC News also indicated the favorable ratings for the Democratic Party sinking to all-time lows.
But there's more.

Confidence in the Democratic Party'scongressional leadershipsunk to an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll conducted early last month.
The confidence rating for Democrats' leadership in Congress stood at 25% in the survey, which was nine points below the previous low of 34% recorded in 2023.
The semi-annual Harvard Youth Poll, which was released late last month, indicated that approval ratings for Democrats in Congress among Americans aged 18-29 nosedived.
POLL POSITION: WHERE TRUMP STANDS 15 WEEKS INTO HIS SECOND PRESIDENCY
An ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted in mid-April indicated that more respondents trusted Trump (40%) than Democrats in Congress (32%) to handle the nation's main problems.
And a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted late last month suggested Republicans hold a significant advantage over Democrats on two top issues: the economy and immigration.
The Democratic Party has been in the political wilderness since last November's election setbacks, when Republicans won back control of the White House and the Senate and defended their fragile House majority. And Republicans made gains among Black andHispanic votersas well as younger voters, all traditional members of the Democratic Party's base.
Since Trump's return to power, an increasingly angry and energized base of Democrats is pushing for party leaders to take a stronger stand in pushing back against the president's sweeping and controversial agenda during the opening months of his second administration.
""What we've seen over the last few months is some Democrats taking it upon themselves to tackle what has been a larger brand problem over the past decade and a half,"" a Democrat strategist and communicator who's a veteran of presidential campaigns told Fox News.
The anger not only at Trump and Republicans but also at fellow Democrats appears to be a factor in the party's polling woes, with the drop in positivity toward the Democrats in the Fox News poll partially being a self-inflicted wound. Party favorability among self-identified Democrats plunged 10 points from last summer (87%) to last month (77%) in the survey.
At the same time, the Republican Party saw a slight improvement among their party faithful: 83% of self-identified Republicans had a favorable view in 2024 vs. 85% in April.
Fox News polling shows the Democratic Party performing poorly in approval even among self-identified Democrats.(Fox News)
But there's a silver lining for the Democrats.

""The higher favorable rating for the Republican Party is entirely due to Democrats feeling less favorable toward their party than Republicans do toward theirs,"" said Democrat pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts the Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. ""This in and of itself is unlikely to translate into midterm success for the GOP as Democrats say they will almost universally vote for their party and independents favor the Democrats as well.""
The Fox News poll indicates that if the 2026 midterm elections were held today, 49% of voters would back a generic Democrat in their congressional district, with 42% supporting the generic Republican candidate.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/dei-dead-heres-what-should-come-next,DEI is dead. Here's what should come next,"White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller vowed that President Donald Trump's administration will bring an end to DEI ""strangulation.""
When President Lyndon Johnson’s later-Vice President Hubert Humphrey championed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, he exclaimed, ""I will eat my hat if this leads to racial quotas."" Following the meteoric rise of DEI over the past few years,Humphrey would need a new hat.
Now, the DEI fad is rightly fading. The Supreme Court overturned affirmative action.Corporations jettisoned DEIupon realizing it improved neither workplace culture nor the bottom line. President Donald Trump eliminated DEI in government and is rooting out remaining discriminatory DEI practices in the private sector.
But what’s truly remarkable isn’t DEI’s demise, butthe extraordinary uniformity of its adoption —uniformity that, once dismantled, will allow for a plurality of policies for hiring, promoting and retaining the right workforce, tailored to each companies’ individual goals.
TRUMP'S CRACKDOWN ON HARVARD, 'WOKE' COLLEGES WILL TAKE MORE THAN 100 DAYS TO LEAVE LASTING REFORM: PROFESSOR
Make no mistake, the DEI orthodoxy demanded faithful allegiance to a narrow set of rules. When 2,500 CEOs signed the identical ""CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion"" pledge, they committed their companies to identical practices like holding unconscious bias trainings and making ""progress"" on demographic metrics — regardless of how these policies might affect their specific businesses.
Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are dead. The big issue is what comes next.(Adobe Stock)
LGBTQ+ organizations like the Human Rights Campaign established scoring systems that effectively required companies to offer employees identical transgender medical benefits packages to earn a coveted ""100% rating"" — practices that in any other context might raise antitrust concerns.
This conformity defied business logic. No company would adopt identical marketing strategies or pricing models as their competitors — yet somehow, they embraced identical approaches to what’s arguably their most crucial asset: their employees.
Chief Talent Officers and HR departments responsible for implementing, and now dismantling, DEI efforts should be leaders in what follows — a flourishing of new ideas and methods to identify and retain the best and brightest employees based on their skills and cultural fit.
This ability to innovate should be welcome. The DEI movement stifled innovation in human resource departments. Every company says they want to attract great employees and build a winning culture. Corporate executives know engaged employees are the difference between top and bottom quartile performing companies.
Yet 73% of publicly traded U.S. companies adopted increasingly rigid DEI commitments. Companies as diverse as SalesForce, Target, Coca-Cola and Bank of America implemented hiring quotas, exclusive race-based access programs, and/or implicit bias training under the DEI banner.
No other department saw the mass adoption of the same ideology. There are thousands of methods for sales teams to increase revenue. ABC — Always Be Closing. SPIN Selling — Situation, Problem, Implication and Need-payoff. PLG - Product Led Growth, etc.
Marketing departments also have endless ways to reach new customers. Three C’s – Company, Customer, Competitor. Four P’s – Product, Price, Place, Promotion. Five M’s – Mission, Money, Message, Media and Measurement.
Financiers are always dreaming up new and exotic ways to value companies (remember WeWork’s ""Community Adjusted EBITDA"" metric?); in their eyes, GAAP is not a standard to be met, but a challenge to be overcome. Yet HR departments across the nation got stuck with the same-old DEI.

Now market observers are asking what comes next. But the question isn't ""what single approach replaces DEI?"" but rather ""why should there be a singular approach?""
There’s good reason to be skeptical of replacing one universal mandate with another. Consider what happens when central planning ends in any sector: innovation flourishes. When the government broke up AT&T’s monopoly in the 1980s, telecommunications transformed from a stagnant utility to the dynamic foundation of the digital economy. When the government deregulated the airlines in the 1970s, air travel became within reach of middle-class Americans.
The end of DEI's monopoly on talent strategy promises a similar renaissance, so long as companies are willing to experiment to find the right approach to meet their unique needs.

Forward-thinking companies are already taking the plunge. Some tech companies are adopting MEI – Merit, Excellence, Intelligence. Maybe police and fire departments want to adopt BRAVE – Bold, Reliable, Accountable, Vigilant, Empathetic. Healthcare workers could adopt CARE – Compassionate, Adaptable, Respectful, Empowered. Construction companies could recruit for STEEL – Skilled, Trustworthy, Efficient, Enduring, Leaders. There are endless opportunities for companies to clearly articulate who is a good fit for their organization.
This isn’t abandoning workplace diversity — it’s enabling its most meaningful form. Research has consistently shown that cognitive diversity — that is, differences in how people think, rather than how they look — increases innovation, creativity and problem-solving. Companies that cultivate this deeper form of diversity will be positioned to outperform.
There will also be greater diversity in hiring approaches more broadly. Some companies may focus on recruiting overlooked talent from Appalachia or first-generation college students. Others might emphasize retention and internal development. Some may adopt high-churn models that rapidly test talent on the job. A few might maintain their grip on their race- and gender-focused DEI policies — albeit with increased legal risk. Companies will experiment, and the free market will decide who wins.
The DEI movement stifled innovation in human resource departments. Every company says they want to attract great employees and build a winning culture.
This approach mirrors America's greatest economic success stories. When soldiers returned from World War II, President Harry Truman didn't send them all to dig ditches. They became entrepreneurs, factory workers, artists and inventors — and unleashed the greatest economic boom in American history. Similarly, as companies are freed from DEI's rigid orthodoxy, they can develop individual approaches to building workforces that they believe will maximize their chances for future success.

Companies will of course have to apply metrics to their chosen strategies to evaluate performance, but individuals should be recruited and promoted based on whatever race- and gender-neutral criteria their company has set. This will lead to better employee fit, lower turnover and improved corporate performance. It will also make good on the Civil Rights Act’s promise to eliminate discrimination, while rendering race and gender quotas a relic of the past.
Even Hubert Humphrey would take off his hat to that.

""We have shared interests. This isn't sustainable, as I said before, especially on the Chinese side — and, you know, 145%, 125% is the equivalent of an embargo. We don't want to decouple — what we want is fair trade,"" Bessent said.
No trade deals have officially been announced since the pause was implemented. The Treasury secretary said at aWhite House press briefinglast week that the United States has had substantial talks with Japan and a deal with India could be imminent.

Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien and Teamsters Motion Picture Division Director Lindsay Dougherty praised President Donald Trump’s call to place a100% tariff on filmsproduced in other countries.
In a Truth Social post on Sunday, Trump wrote that the ""Movie Industry in America is DYING a very fast death."" He went on to warn, ""Other Countries are offering all sorts of incentives to draw our filmmakers and studios away from the United States,"" and that, ""Hollywood, and many other areas within the U.S.A., are being devastated.""
Trump added that plans to institute a tariff are in the works, and he authorized the Department of Commerce and the United States Trade Representative ""to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.""
The two representatives of the Teamsters union praised Trump for this in astatement, saying, ""For years, Hollywood studios have hollowed out the industry by following Corporate America’s crooked playbook of outsourcing good union jobs. Studios chase cheap production costs overseas while gutting the American workforce that built the film and TV industry.""
The Teamsters president praised Trump for the new tariff he proposed, suggesting that Democrats are reflexively against whatever agenda he embraces.

""While these companies get rich fleeing to other countries and gaming the system, our members have gotten screwed over. The Teamsters Union has been sounding the alarm for years. If studios want to benefit from American box offices, they must invest in American workers.
The statement included an explicit statement of praise for Trump himself, declaring, ""We thank President Trump for boldly supporting good union jobs when others have turned their heads. This is a strong step toward finally reining in the studios’ un-American addiction to outsourcing our members’ work.""
The union clarified that they are willing to praise representatives of any party for embracing such an agenda.
""The Teamsters applaud any elected official — Republican, Democrat, Independent — who’s willing to fight for American workers,"" the statement read. ""We look forward to continuing to work with the administration to build a trade agenda that benefits our members and workers throughout the American motion picture and TV industry.""
It concluded, ""It’s time to create good film jobs here at home by bringing production back to America.""

At one point in the interview, Fox News host John Roberts asked the union boss what he thinks about how Democrats are ""demonizing"" the president. O’Brien suggested that the Democratic Party is reflexively against anything Trump wants.
""I think I’ve said this before, whatever President Trump does, even if it’s good for this country, just because his name is Trump, he’s not gonna get the support,"" O’Brien said of the Democratic Party. ""We are looking beyond any differences of opinions that we have had with anybody.""

Maria Salazar, R-Fla., and Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer discuss President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs and bringing manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. on ‘Fox & Friends Weekend.’
FIRST ON FOX:Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is urging PresidentDonald Trump's Department of Labor to open an investigation into Tyson Foods on Tuesday after receiving a whistleblower report claiming the company employed child labor at one of its facilities.
Hawley wrotea letter to Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer on Tuesday, urging her to investigate the matter. He said his Senate Judiciary subcommittee opened its own investigation after being contacted by the whistleblower.
Tyson plants in Tennessee and elsewhere have been the subject of child labor investigations in recent years.
""The whistleblower, a former Tyson Foods employee who oversaw plant safety, alleges that they personally witnessed underage workers and also received multiple reports from hourly Tyson employees about child workers in the plant. According to the allegations, these child workers were employed by a third-party entity contracted by Tyson for work in the plant,"" Hawley wrote in his letter.""After reporting concerns to company superiors about child workers employed at the plant, the whistleblower was subjected to retaliation and a 'toxic work environment.' Due to the toxic work environment, the whistleblower quit. Tyson is now pursuing legal action against them related to their departure from the company,"" the letter continued.

Hawley went on to note media reports showing that ""Tyson purposely uses subcontractors to avoid punishment for illegally employing children. As a result, Tyson has successfully avoided all liability and culpability for its clear violations of child labor laws.""
Tyson denied any wrongdoing in a statement to Fox News Digital on Tuesday.
""We do not allow the employment of anyone under the age of 18 in any of our facilities, and we do not facilitate, excuse, or in any other way participate in the use of child labor by third parties. We take the enforcement of all labor laws seriously, and we verify the age of all team members by fully participating in the federal government's E-Verify and IMAGE programs. We also have multiple processes in place, including an anonymous ethics hotline, for all team members to report suspicious activity,"" a Tyson Foods spokesperson said in a statement.

PresidentDonald Trumpis giving himself a big thumbs-up when it comes to his job performance during his second tour of duty in the White House.
""We had the greatest100 daysin the history of our country,"" Trump touted on Sunday night, as he spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One.
Trump has aggressively asserted executive authority in his second term, overturning long-standing government policy and making major cuts to the federal workforce through an avalanche of sweeping and controversial executive orders and actions – with some aimed at addressing grievances he has held since his first term.
However, it appears many Americans are not applauding the job Trump is doing steering the nation.

Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president'spoll positionwhen he started his second tour of duty in the White House. An average of the latest national surveys puts the president's approval rating underwater by around six points.
Trump stood at 44% approval and 55% disapproval in the most recentFox News national poll, which was conducted April 18-21.

The president's approval rating was also 11 points in the red in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted April 25-27, but a trio of other surveys released in recent days put Trump slightly above water.
Trump does not care about the polls.
""Never been a better 100 days,"" he said on Sunday. Then, the president blasted what he charged were ""fake polls.""
His claim reiterated charges made last week, during the intense coverage of the president as he reached the 100-day mark into his second administration.

Contributing to the drop in Trump's poll numbers are increased concerns by Americans over the economy and inflation, which were pressing issues that kept former PresidentJoe Biden's approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency.
Additionally, Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement a month ago, which sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners, triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.
The president's approval rating on the economy stood at 38% in the Fox News poll, with just a third of respondents approving of the job he was doing handling inflation and tariffs.
However, Trump, on Sunday, touted that ""inflation is down, all costs are down,"" as he pointed to the top issue that landed him back in the White House.
WILL TRUMP'S MAGA DOMINANCE OVER THE GOP LAST AFTER HE'S GONE?
Doug Heye, a longtime GOP strategist and communicator on Capitol Hill and veteran of the Republican National Committee and the President George W. Bush administration, noted that ""the main reason Trump won was to lower prices. Prices haven't lowered, and polls are reflecting that.""
""It makes the politics of tariffs perilous for Trump – if prices rose because of Trump fiat, Biden/Trump voters may desert him,"" Heye argued.
The presidential approval rating is one of the most closely watched polling indicators and often heavily influences upcoming elections. Additionally, with the party in power – which is obviously Republicans thanks to their control of the White House and both chambers of Congress – traditionally facing political headwinds in the midterm elections, there is growing concern in the GOP over the president's slippage in the polls.
However, Heye cautioned that ""polling in May of an off year doesn't tell us anything about what could happen 18 months later.""
Trump's overall approval rating is close to where he stood 100 days into his first term in office, in 2017, when he stood at 45% approval in Fox News polling.

So how does Trump stack up against his presidential predecessors?
""John F. Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower had the highest first-quarter average ratings, with both registering above 70%, while Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan averaged between 60% and 69%. George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, Joe Biden and Bill Clinton had similar average ratings of 55% to 58% in their first quarters,"" Gallup noted in a poll released two weeks ago on presidential approval ratings.
Gallup highlighted that ""Trump is the only president to have sub-50% average approval ratings during a first quarter in office.""
However, enjoying promising approval ratings out of the gate does not guarantee a positive and productive presidency.
Carter's poll numbers sank into negative territory less than two years into his presidency, and he was resoundingly defeated in his bid for re-election in 1980.

Biden stood at 54% approval in Fox News polling 100 days into office, with his numbers hovering in the low-to-mid-50s during the first six months of his single term as president.
However, Biden's numbers sank into negative territory in the late summer and autumn of 2021, in the wake of his much-criticized handling of the turbulent U.S. exit from Afghanistan and amid soaring inflation and a surge of migrants crossing into the U.S. along the nation's southern border with Mexico.

Two of President Donald Trump's staunch critics – California DemocratsGov. Gavin Newsomand Sen. Adam Schiff – are now offering to work with the Republican administration on federal tax incentives to bring back movie-making from overseas.
Newsom sued the Trump administration in federal court last month over what he said was ""an unprecedented tariff regime"" and said he was ""reaching out to our international partners to protect California jobs and industries."" But as Trump called attention to how U.S. production houses are increasingly going international – at the detriment of middle-class Hollywood workers who make a living off of Los Angeles-area shoots – Newsom took a more collaborative tone.
""California built the film industry – and we’re ready to bring even more jobs home,"" Newsom wrote on X Monday. ""We’ve proven what strong state incentives can do. Now it’s time for a real federal partnership to Make America Film Again.""
""@POTUS, let’s get it done,"" Newsom added, tagging the account for the president of the United States.

In a statement to theNew York Times,Newsom said he wanted to work with the Trump administration on a $7.5 billion federal tax credit program to bolster the TV and film production industry.
It would be the first federal-level incentive program for the film industry in the U.S. While more than three dozen states already have incentive programs, none top a billion, according to the Times.
Schiff, D-Calif.,meanwhile, criticized Trump's proposed idea of implementing tariffs to curb foreign movie-making.
""I share the administration’s desire to bring movie making back to the United States. While blanket tariffs on all films would have unintended and potentially damaging impacts, we have an opportunity to work together to pass a major federal film tax credit to re-shore American jobs in the industry,"" Schiff said in a statementto Deadline.""I welcome the opportunity to work with the administration and my Republican colleagues to pass a globally competitive federal film incentive to bring back run-away production.""
The White House said Monday that ""no final decisions"" had been made as the administration was ""exploring all options"" to deliver on Trump’s directive ""to safeguard our country’s national and economic security while Making Hollywood Great Again.""

Trump first announced in a Truth Social post on Sunday that he was authorizing the Department of Commerce and the U.S. trade representative ""to immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% Tariff on any and all Movies coming into our Country that are produced in Foreign Lands.""
PRESIDENT TRUMP'S HOLLYWOOD AMBASSADOR JON VOIGHT ROLLS OUT PROPOSAL TO 'MAKE HOLLYWOOD GREAT AGAIN'
Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Trump further asserted that Hollywood was ""being destroyed"" by a ""grossly incompetent governor"" and foreign nations shelling out ""big money"" to attract U.S. production houses.
Over the weekend, one ofTrump's Hollywood ambassadors,Jon Voight, along with special advisor Steven Paul, delivered to the president a ""comprehensive plan"" to save the film and television industry during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago.
""While President Trump regularly corresponds with his Hollywood Ambassadors, including Jon Voight, to restore America’s cultural dominance, it was President Trump himself who formulated the idea of using tariffs to Make Hollywood Great Again."" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to Fox News on Monday.

Voight and Paul met with ""dozens of leading film and television organizations (guilds, unions, studios and streamers) about what changes need to be made to increase domestic film production,"" according to a statement.
The meeting was conducted in person with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and included SP Media Group/Atlas Comics President Scott Karol.
""The proposal includes federal tax incentives, significant changes to several tax codes, the establishment ofco-production treatieswith foreign countries, and infrastructure subsidies for theater owners, film and television production companies, and post-production companies,"" the statement said. ""The proposal also includes a focus on job training, and tariffs in certain limited circumstances.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-latest-move-proves-his-manufacturing-golden-age-just-fools-gold,Trump’s latest move proves his manufacturing Golden Age is just fools’ gold,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich has the latest on the Trump administration’s tariff negotiations with China and more on ‘Special Report.’
President Donald Trump continues to promisethat his tariff regime will usher in a new Golden Age for American workers with an explosion of high-paying manufacturing jobs across the Rust Belt and America.  These tariffs will certainly drive up the costs of imports, hurting American consumers. As demand for foreign goods declines, the unfairly maligned trade deficit targeted by the president may indeed narrow. But more expensive imports also guarantee the supposed manufacturing renaissance will turn out to be fools’ gold for American workers and will not boost exports.
Contrary to popular belief,American exporters have enjoyeda manufacturing renaissance. Since 1994, American exports have nearly tripled, even after you adjust for inflation.
Americangoods exported exceeded $2 trillionlast year. America’s aerospace industry now exports nearly $100 billion a year. The American automotive sector exports more than $160 billion annually, nearly doubling in inflation-adjusted terms since 1994. American soybean farmers supply livestock around the globe with feed. Each of these export-intensive sectors stands to lose jobs due to these tariffs.
US TRADE REPRESENTATIVE SAYS IT’S A MATTER OF ‘WEEKS’ BEFORE NEW TRADE DEAL ANNOUNCEMENTS
First, don’t expect an overall gain in American manufacturing jobs. Certainly, individual companies may benefit. A tariff on steel might save a few jobs at a specific steel mill. But the cost for every American manufacturer using this higher-priced domestic steel will also increase.

American manufacturing relies on a complex global supply chain utilizing imported parts. Automakers, construction firms and appliance makers all must pass this cost along — sometimes cutting wages or even jobs to stay afloat.
Numerous American companies have already begun laying off American workers in response to the tariffs, including at five Stellantis plants. Currently, up to 30% of North American auto production may be temporarily halted due to the tariff uncertainty. These headlines will become routine if the trade war continues.
American manufacturers, who export their American-made goods to the rest of the world, will fall behind as their input costs increase. This danger compounds as other nations retaliate against us by imposing their own barriers. As American exporters find their market shares shrinking and costs rising, American companies will see their profits plunge and American jobs vanish.
Second, the limited tariff-created manufacturing jobs will not be better paid jobs. Good-paying jobs are contingent on productivity. Higher tariffs lower labor productivity as less efficient businesses are protected from competition.
Thanks largely to the innovation and efficiencies from free trade, our jobs market has diversified away from a concentration of jobs in a lower-paying, physically demanding industry. The burgeoning sectors have supplied tens of millions of Americans with opportunities in safer professions.
Productivity overall of workers doubled in just the past 40 years. It’s not just investors or managers who benefit as resources yield more output. Workers share in this abundance of affordable, available and diverse goods.
Our so-called ""trade deficit"" has largely enabled this boom in newer, more productive jobs. The surplus dollars overseas generated by us importing more than we export flow back to the United States often in the form of foreign direct investment (FDI) in businesses here — exploding more than 500% compared to thirty years ago to more than $330 billion last year. If the president succeeds at eliminating this trade deficit, workers employed in these new jobs will suffer as foreign direct dries up.
Economic distortion caused by tariffs will shift jobs and resources to industries in which we lack a comparative economic advantage. As government policies deploy resources to less efficient businesses, more individuals will be forced to take these less desirable jobs.

The overall decline in business output translates not only to less profit; it yields less take-home pay and consumption for middle-class families. Workers will be harmed by this shift to lower-paying jobs.
Contrast this world of fewer, lower-paying jobs with a competitive environment which ensures that over time, each employee can produce more without working more. Business owners, employees and consumers all benefit. Higher prices on imported goods will not magically make American manufacturers more efficient or innovative. Quite the inverse!
By shielding them from competition, these businesses will grow complacent — with less incentive to improve, cut costs, and deliver better products at lower prices. As productivity declines, the standard of living for workers will also decline.

The ingredients for a flourishing manufacturing sector are lower regulations, lower taxes and more freedom to trade with others. In fact, many jobs returned to the USA after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) because America became more competitive with the rest of the world.
Embracing even part of this recipe has created a ""Golden Age"" for the past 40 years. Millions of people who would have previously worked in lower-paying factory jobs, now work in higher-paying, advanced services.
In fact, we now export far more of these services than we import. For this reason, the typical American family enjoys an annual income $26,000 greater than just one generation ago. A record percentage of young adults are participating in our stronger economy.
Tariffs are a roadblock to prosperity, not a highway.

The overall decline in business output translates not only to less profit; it yields less take-home pay and consumption for middle-class families. Workers will be harmed by this shift to lower-paying jobs.
We’ve been here before: Look at the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930. It was meant to protect American industry, but it prolonged the Great Depression by choking global trade. The layoffs, price hikes, financial carnage and cratering approval ratings caused by this historic tax increase may cajole the president into soon relenting.
If not, the promised manufacturing jobs will come at the expense of jobs elsewhere and be far fewer in number than promised. We will produce less, consume less and earn less. The Golden Age will deliver nothing but fools’ gold: Politically caused scarcity in an age of abundance.

On Sunday,hundreds of protestorsmarched through Sheepshead Bay chanting, ""Vote them out,"" after city officials moved to build a homeless shelter on a site residents originally approved in 2022 as affordable housing.
Residents said the change – which occurred after a developer pulled out of the project – was made in 2023 without any further input from the community.

The New York Postreported that locals are cautious of homeless shelters as they attract crime and danger.
""I do believe homeless people should have a place to go, but I was talking to my dad earlier and he told me that he has homeless friends that are scared to be in these shelters because of how dangerous the other people that are there are, it’s not even safe for a lot of homeless people to be there,"" 21-year-old Sheepshead Bay resident Fruma Feldman said to the Post.

Last week, pollster Frank Luntz expressed his surprise this way: ""I've never seen this before,"" he said. ""Because usually, when you're hurt economically, that changes your perspective and your politics. Not with these people. They're staying firm.""
Luntz is good at his job, and he’s accurate here. But it shouldn’t come as a surprise. It is a quite predictable result of just how fed up Trump’s voters are with the status quo.
Those in power or with loud voices in DC and Gotham still haven’t fully come to terms with the Trump phenomenon.
Look at it this way: The American people elected Donald Trump president of the United States. DONALD TRUMP! Twice! There is no rational way to look at that and conclude that voters wanted a steady hand to fix things on the margins but not break anything.
Trump’s supporters are not going to run to the hills because the stock market gets bouncy or Barbie dolls get a few bucks pricier, because they clearly see Trump’s upside.

Doug and Danny are both in their fifties, Doug is Danny’s boss, and Danny runs the steel cleaning crew at the Voss Clark plant in Indiana. Chatting with them, I was talking to both management and labor, and also two good friends.
Both guys are still all in on Trump. ""In a heartbeat,"" Danny told me when asked if he would still vote for Trump. And it wasn’t tariffs they wanted to talk about, it was the president’s promise to end taxes on overtime.
Doug told me that this policy would ""encourage [younger workers] to give up their time, away from loved ones and produce for customers that we have, that need steel, that they want that we did not produce Monday through Friday and get it done.""
I got to see some of this in action at the steel cleaning facility just down the road, and even though it was 10 p.m., the workers were cleaning their giant rolls of steel, and would be overnight.

These guys like what they do more than anyone I’ve ever met who works in a cubicle, and they’d like it even more if their sacrifice of overtime was rewarded with a tax break.
Over half of the employees at Voss Clark make more than $100,000 a year. In southern Indiana, where the cost of living is low, that's buy-a-house-and-raise-a-family kinda money. Don’t tell me these are jobs native-born Americans don’t want.
It may be remarkable that despite the entirety of the liberal media and even a decent chunk of the conservative media railing against tariffs, Trump’s voters still trust him on the issue. But it should not come as a surprise.

For the first time in decades in places like Jeffersonville, the working man and woman feel they have a president who is on their side, who will put their needs before those of the stock market and the intelligentsia.
Do these working Americans know that Trump’s policies might fail? Sure, they aren’t stupid. They get the risk. But they didn’t vote to spruce up the status quo, they voted to destroy it, and that is why some economic discomfort will not scare them away from Donald Trump.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/how-donald-trump-can-terminate-tariff-turmoil,This is how Donald Trump can terminate tariff turmoil,"Economist Steve Moore discusses President Donald Trump’s economic policy and the April jobs report on ‘Fox Report.’
This past April has been one of the most volatile months in stock market history, thanks to the Trump administration’s botched rollout of its so-called reciprocal tariff rates. However, this tariff threat has at least succeeded in bringing other nations to the negotiating table – and now, the best way to restore calm is by letting Trump do what he does best: negotiate.
That’s a difficult pill to swallow for businesses likeAmazon, which is addicted to artificially cheap imports from nations like China. Instead of pressuring Chinese vendors to cut costs or force the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the negotiating table, Amazon has been flirting with pressuring the Trump administration to drop the whole tariff fight altogether.
Recently, for example, officials in the company were debating whether to display a so-called ""tariff cost"" along with the price of items for sale. Amazon called this transparency – but nothing could be further from the truth.
AMAZON DENIES TARIFF PRICING PLAN THAT WHITE HOUSE CALLED 'HOSTILE AND POLITICAL'
For one thing, where was this ""transparency"" when former presidentJoe Biden’sfour-decade-high inflation caused consumer prices to explode?
Anecdotally, some products that I used to buy on the site doubled in price during Biden’s tenure. Yet Amazon never dared tell consumers what portion of these price increases was caused by Biden’s overspending.
Similarly, when Biden exploded regulatory compliance costs (which also directly impacted consumer prices), Amazon never told consumers how much of their bill at checkout was from overregulation. Folks never saw an ""inflation cost"" or ""regulation cost"" while Biden was president.
TREASURY SECRETARY BESSENT SIGNALS US ADVANTAGE IN TARIFF BATTLE AS CHINA'S ECONOMY CRUMBLES
Not only that, but where would Amazon even get the data needed to display the effect of tariffs on the cost of individual items?
This information certainly can’t come from Chinese vendors. Anyone attached to the CCP is consistently pressured to lie and publish falsified data.
Ironically, it’s more important that we make these trade deals with China’s key trading partners than with our own. By peeling nations like India, Japan, and Australia out of China’s sphere of influence, Trump can isolate the CCP and force them to their knees.
Instead, finding information about (for example) the amount China exports requires finding how much every other nation is importing fromChinaand adding those figures. Only then can one gain a better sense of whether the ""official"" CCP data is accurate.
Unfortunately, even such a painstaking method is imperfect because the CCP can pressure other totalitarian states to either falsify or neglect to publish relevant data. China itself simply stopped publishing unemployment data when the figures got too ugly for the CCP’s liking.
BUFFETT CRITICIZES TRUMP'S TARIFFS ROLLOUT, SAYS US SHOULDN’T USE 'TRADE AS A WEAPON'
Amazon has since backed away from the idea of displaying estimated ""tariff costs"" on its site. But even the discussion of such an idea speaks to how spooked markets are about potential tariffs.
If PresidentDonald Trumpis not able to make any deals before the end of the 90-day pause, the ensuing tariffs will amount to a massive tax increase on American consumers and foreign producers alike, grinding economic growth to a halt.
But Trump failing to negotiate isn’t at all a foregone conclusion. In fact, we’ve recently seen extremely positive developments with key trading partners like India and Japan.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS: COMPANIES THAT WILL INVEST $1B OR MORE IN THE US
In other words, there’s plenty of economic runway left (as Treasury SecretaryScott Bessentput it recently), and Trump can still safely land this plane.
What exactly does that look like? In short, it means signing bilateral trade deals with key trading partners to both guarantee American consumers can still access a wide variety of affordable products from abroad and ensure that American exporters can finally access to foreign consumer markets.
Ironically, it’s more important that we make these trade deals with China’s key trading partners than with our own. By peeling nations like India, Japan, and Australia out of China’s sphere of influence, Trump can isolate the CCP and force them to their knees. Despite what China’s government reports may say, the country’s economy is already vulnerable and hurting – it cannot afford a drawn-out trade war.

Trump and Bessent still have economic runway to get this done and alleviate all the tariff turmoil in the coming weeks and months.
If they succeed in doing so – at the same time as they seek to shepherd a massive tax cut through Congress and deregulate at breakneck speed – America will be headed to the promised Golden Age, meaning more American jobs and a lower cost of living.

Vice President JD Vance saidMike Waltzhas the trust of both himself and President Donald Trump after the now-removed national security advisor was nominated Thursday to become the next U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
""I think you could make a good argument that it’s a promotion,"" Vance said in an exclusive interview on ""Special Report"" from the Nucor Steel Berkeley plant in South Carolina. ""We brought Mike on to do some serious reforms at the National Security Council. He has done that.""
The former Ohio senator said the White House believes Waltz will better serve the administration as UN ambassador, a Senate-confirmed position.

Waltz’s exit comes nearly four months after he resigned fromhis Florida congressional seatto take the NSA role at the White House. The Army veteran faced growing scrutiny after he created a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal in late March, where top national security officials discussed pending attacks against the Houthis in Yemen.

Waltz inadvertently added The Atlantic’s editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to the ""Houthi PC small group"" on Signal, whereDefense Secretary Pete Hegsethshared sensitive information about the timing of U.S. military strikes in Yemen.
Hegseth, a former ""Fox & Friends Weekend"" co-host, maintains the information he shared was not classified.

Democrats have expressed disbelief that information relating to targets and strikes would not have been classified given its sensitive nature. The Pentagon’s acting inspector general isinvestigating Hegseth’s useof Signal.
Vance told Fox News chief political anchor Bret Baier that Waltz’s ousting was not a result of ""Signalgate,"" which he called a ""nothingburger."" He argued the former Florida congressman is simply being moved to another administration position because Trump believes Waltz would do a ""better job in a different role.""
The vice president was also added to theSignal group chatalong with DNI Tulsi Gabbard, CIA director John Ratcliffe and other senior members of the Trump administration.
In the chat, Vance expressed his disagreement with the strikes, arguing that such action could be seen as ""inconsistent"" with Trump’s foreign policy messaging when it comes to European allies stepping up to the plate for their own defense. He viewed the strikes as ""bailing"" Europe out.

""I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There’s a further risk that we see a moderate to severespike in oil prices.I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc,"" the vice president wrote in Signal.
HOUTHIS SHOOT DOWN 3RD US REAPER DRONE AS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES DAILY AIRSTRIKES
Vance told Baier that he believes the Signal chat reflected well on him because it shows his willingness to engage in conversation with other administration officials about how best to implement the president’s agenda.
""I think that's what a good national security team should do,"" he explained.
The U.S. has been striking Houthi targets in Yemen for more than 40 days straight.US Central Command (CENTCOM)said in a statement earlier this week that since the start of Operation Rough Rider, it has struck over 800 targets.

Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner sat down with Fox News Digital to discuss the agency's biggest wins during theTrump administration's first 100 days, and shared HUD's top priorities for the next 100.
Some of those wins, according to Scott, includerescinding Biden and Obama-eraregulations to spur innovation and creativity in the housing market. Other actions have included reforms focused on ensuring American citizens are the primary beneficiaries of HUD's resources, and ensuring HUD's resources can be accessed in a fair and safe manner. Looking to the future, Turner said implementing work requirements for those in HUD-funded housing programs will be a priority, among others.
""We are very focused, we're very detailed, and we're very deliberate about what we do here,"" Turner said. ""Progress and success doesn't just happen. You have to be very intentional about it. You have to be very focused about it. One thing we did on the first day when we came in here is we said we're going to restore the mission-minded focus of HUD… We're called to a specific mission to serve the most vulnerable people of our country, as it pertains to housing, as it pertainsto homelessness, as it pertains to disaster recovery, the development of communities, forming public-private partnerships.""

Part of restoring that ""mission-minded focus,"" according to Turner, has been to tear down ""burdensome regulations,"" such as the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing rule establishedunder the Obama administrationand revived by the Biden administration.
""We took this rule down in order to restore flexibility and restore the power back to localities. Because every city, every community, is unique,"" Turner said, noting that under the now-rescinded rule, bureaucrats in Washington had the power to pick ""winners and losers"" in local communities.
Turner also highlighted a new partnership between HUD and the Department of Homeland Security, aimed at ensuring noncitizens do not take away much-needed HUD resources from American citizens.

""We are ensuring that American people live in HUD-funded housing,"" Turner said. ""Also with this partnership, it's a data collection emphasis to understand who's living in housing that's funded by HUD and our FHA insurance, our FHA-backed mortgages, which is also backed by American taxpayers. We took out the non-permanent residence category out of the FHA, which the Biden administration turned a blind eye to.""

Turner also touted one of his first actions as HUD secretary, which rescinded the Obama-era equal access rule, requiring HUD-funded programs and shelters to determine eligibility based on a person's self-identified gender. ""We wanted to take this rule down to protect the women of America and ensure that when people enter into a HUD-funded facility, they are entering in after sex at birth,"" Turner said of the reform.
Looking to the future, Turner said efforts aimed at helping those receiving public assistance become more self-sufficient, such as through work requirements for those in HUD-funded housing, will be a priority for the agency over the next 100 days.
""Social safety nets were never meant to be a hammock or a resting place. Social safety nets were meant to be a trampoline, if you will, a tool to project people into a life of self-sustainability and longevity, and so that's something that we will be concentrating on going here forward these next 100 days, if you will,"" Turner said. ""Our heart here at HUD is not to grow the amount of people on subsidies, but it is to reduce the number of people on subsidies and help people to live a life of self sustainability, really, to change the trajectory of people's lives.""

Turner also said the agency will focus on increasing public-private partnerships to help improvehousing affordabilityand the homelessness epidemic, noting local entities on the ground doing the actual work to affect change are pivotal to HUD completing its mission.
When asked about any pushback Turner has received over his slew of policy changes during the Trump administration's first 100 days, the secretary said part of being a strong ""servant leader"" is to make hard decisions that everybody may not agree with.

House Republicans are split over whether they would consider raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans as GOP lawmakers negotiate ways to pay for PresidentDonald Trump'smultitrillion-dollar agenda.
""Personally, I think that that should be on the table if we're not going to make spending cuts, but I hope we make spending cuts,"" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, R-Md., told Fox News Digital Monday.
On the other side of the debate, Republicans like Rep. Randy Fine, R-Fla., has said, ""I'm a hard no on any [tax hike]. The problem is not that the government does not have enough money. The problem is the government spends too much money.""
Congressional Republicans have begun work in earnest to craft a massive piece of legislation aimed at advancing Trump's agenda on a broad array of issues — border security, immigration, national defense, domestic energy production, the debt limit and taxes.
WHITE HOUSE QUIETLY FLOATS MILLIONAIRE TAX HIKE PROPOSAL IN CONGRESS AS GOP LEADERS SIGNAL OPPOSITION
Chip Roy, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Nathaniel Moran are among the Republicans who discussed taxes with Fox News Digital.(Fox News Digital)
The tax portion alone could cost as much as $4.5 trillion over the next 10 years, according to House Republicans' framework for the bill.
Conservative fiscal hawks have, in return, demanded at least $1.5 trillion in spending cut offsets. And with the deadline to act on the debt limit expected to hit sometime this summer, Republicans are on the clock to reach an agreement between the House and Senate and send it to Trump's desk.
A possible increase in taxes on wealthy Americans is just one avenue Republicans are looking at to help pay for Trump's newer policies that include eliminating taxes on tips, overtime wages and retirees' Social Security.
Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., a member of the House's tax writing panel, the Ways and Means Committee, suggested a small tax increase could be considered.
""There's potentially some talk about a tax hike on wealthier Americans. I think our goal in this committee, and the president's goal, has been to provide tax relief for the working and middle class,""she said.
Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., signaled to Fox News Digital he would be open to it too but acknowledged the risks.
""I'm open-minded to what the president or the treasury secretary may have in mind. And I would want to see some numbers behind it and how it would have an effect on the economy,"" Stutzman said. ""What I've heard from people in the upper tax brackets is, you know, they're willing to pay more as long as they know that it's paying the debt down. They don't want to see it go towards more spending.""
He added, however, that with financial markets still wrestling with reactions to Trump's tariffs, ""raising taxes is probably not a good conversation to have.""
In addition to Trump's newtax policies, Republicans are seeking to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Many of its provisions expire at the end of this year.
Rep. Nathaniel Moran, R-Texas, another Ways and Means Committee member, pointed out that failing to pass a bill altogether and allowing TCJA to expire would lead to a tax hike for millions.
""I do not support raising taxes across the board at all. I want to keep those taxes low,"" Moran said. ""But if we don't do anything, inaction will bring the largest tax hike in American history. We cannot let that happen.""
SCOOP: PENCE URGES REPUBLICANS TO HOLD THE LINE ON TAX HIKES FOR THE RICH AS TRUMP WEIGHS OPTIONS
Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, did not specifically weigh in on tax hikes when asked but said Republicans would fall short of their tax goals if proper spending cuts were not found.
""All I care is that we actually do math with reasonable models based on reasonable assumptions. And so, look, to the extent that my colleagues are unwilling to do the shrinking and reduction of government that is necessary, then we're going to have to deal with the tax side of things,"" he said.
""And that means not being able to get full 10-year [extensions], not being able to get every single tax extension that you want, not getting some of the new tax cuts that we want. So, all those things will end up being on the table if we don't do our job.""
Rep. Mary Miller, R-Ill., said, ""I don't support tax hikes. I support spending cuts.""

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., would not share any details of the forthcoming plan when asked about a possible tax hike.
""There's a lot of things that I've been reading in the press that have not been accurate, but I'm not going to say whether it's accurate or not, and they'll see the bill whenever we deliver it right before markup,"" Smith told Fox News Digital.

""But what I will say is, is that we will have a tax bill that is pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family, pro-small business and pro-workers. And Republicans believe in making sure that Americans keep more of their hard-earned dollars, and you'll see a tax package that does that.""
He said Americans would likely get to see that plan in a matter of ""days, not months.""
When reached for comment on the possibility of tax hikes in Trump's agenda bill, a senior White House official told Fox News Digital, ""The president is reviewing a wide range of tax cut proposals for inclusion in the reconciliation bill. He is most focused on tax policy that will help create more good-paying jobs in America and delivering the major tax cuts he campaigned on for working and middle-class Americans.""

Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., said the economic challenge sparked by President Donald Trump's ""chaos and uncertainty"" is the biggest issue facing thePeach State, stressing that the president's uncertain economic policy is impacting how businesses and residents make decisions for the future.
Ossoff, preparing to run for re-election in 2026, potentially against Georgia's popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has yet to announce if he will join the race. Ossoff is the only Democrat seeking reelection who represents a state that Trump won last year, making him a top target for Republicans hoping to maintain their Senate majority.
""I am more than prepared for any challenger,"" Ossoff, 38, told The Associated Press on Saturday while declining to comment on any potential opponents.
Ossoff defeated incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue in a runoff in 2021, helping Democrats flip control of the Senate and hold onto the chamber's majority for four years during the Biden administration.

During his first four years, Ossoff attempted to establish a reputation as a senator working to advance Georgia's traditional interests, including its farmers and military bases. He says he will attempt towork with Republicansto deliver for Georgia.
The senator, who has recently intensified his criticisms of Trump, warned Saturday that businesses and households in Georgia are struggling to plan for the future because of constant changes in the federal government's trade and economic moves.
""Businesses are unable to invest with an understanding of what the rules of international trade will be from one hour or week or month to the next,"" Ossoff told The Associated Press. ""Households are unable to plan their annual budgets because there’s so much chaos and uncertainty in the implementation of federal economic policy.""
""This administration needs to clearly define its economic objectives, and it needs to competently implement its plan, whatever that plan may be,"" he continued. ""The fact that the White House does not even know what its policy is, and is with such unpredictability and chaos, lurching from one policy to the other, is putting the state’s economy at serious economic risk.""

Ossoff also expressed concerns about Trump's authoritarian and ""un-American"" executive action since returning to the White House in January, pointing to the president's attempts to go after his political opponents.
""We have never seen a president try to wield the federal government to crush his critics and political adversaries,"" Ossoff said. ""That’s something new in American history, and it is, in my view, un-American. And it’s something that should chill us to the bone, no matter our politics, no matter our policy preferences.""
The lawmaker urged Republicans to remember that eventually a Democrat will be president again and ""the shoe will be on the other foot.""
""This is about checks and balances,"" he said. ""This is about whether or not the executive branch is constrained as designed by our Constitution, by judicious legislators who can put their partisanship aside to protect the public interest.""
Ossoff explained that, while Democrats have limited power without control of the White House or either chamber of Congress, a big part of his job at the moment is to inform the people of Georgia that Trump's policies are not in the state's best interest.
Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., speaks during an interview at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Saturday, April 26, 2025, in Marietta, Georgia.(AP)
In addition to his criticism of Trump, Ossoff has cited shortcomings during the Biden administration, particularly when it comes to border security. He was one of 12 Democrats who voted for the Laken Riley Act, named after a Georgia nursing student murdered by Venezuelan migrant Jose Antonio Ibarra.
The law requires illegal migrants accused — even without a conviction — of theft or violent crimes to be detained by the Department of Homeland Security.
""My view is that the American people expect and deserve secure borders,"" Ossoff said. ""And I think the Biden administration failed in its border policies. The American people expect and deserve for people who enter this country illegally and may pose a threat to public safety or national security to be apprehended by the authorities.""

""But the American people don’t support and don’t expect federal police raids on elementary schools and hospitals and churches,"" he continued, referring to theTrump administration'scontroversial immigration enforcement actions. ""And [the American people] don’t expect our military installations to become mass prison camps for immigrants and don’t want entire families rounded up with no due process. We just learned yesterday about a two-year-old U.S. citizen — a two-year-old girl — who was deported without due process. Our immigration policy needs to be responsible and serious. It also needs to be humane.""

TIM SCOTT AND SECRETARY SCOTT TURNER: Save the Opportunity Zones before it’s too late","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
In 2017, Congress passed one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in the last quarter-century. When President Donald Trump signed theTax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA),the law spurred economic growth the United States hadn’t seen in a generation. Wages increased, and unemployment decreased. Americans were able to cash their paychecks and go home to their families with more money in their pockets.
Now, eight years later, major TCJA provisions are up for renewal. Among them:Opportunity Zones,a successful, bipartisan piece of legislation that is transforming underserved communities in real time.  Opportunity Zones have made an incredible impact across our nation.
The Opportunity Zone (OZ) initiative allows investors from all over the United States toinvest their capital gains earningsin economically distressed communities where new investments can be eligible for preferential capital gains tax treatment. Instead of sitting idle in a brokerage or bank account, this money is put to work in communities that have not seen significant private investment for some time.
GOP PUSH TO MAKE TRUMP’S 2017 TAX CUTS PERMANENT, SAY GOING BACK WOULD BE A ‘DRAMATIC’ CHANGE FOR MANY
This pro-growth tax policy offers crucial incentives that do not cost American taxpayers a single cent. In 2017, this kind of policy may have seemed unbelievable to some within the Beltway. Despite the skepticism, OZs are actively transforming communities and creating economic opportunities for families in the poorest zip codes.

Erie, Pennsylvania may best exemplify the economic benefits and the tangible changes Opportunity Zones can create in a relatively short period of time. In 2018, the city’s downtown ZIP code, 16501, was named the poorest in Pennsylvania and among the poorest nationwide.  However, through the potential of OZs, the stigma of Pennsylvania’s poorest ZIP code served as a springboard for investment in the area.
Shortly after TCJA was signed into law, a group of local residents recognized how Opportunity Zones could revitalize the city. Major employers, local universities and other organizations partnered to provide initial financial backing to form the Erie Downtown Development Corporation (EDDC).
To date, EDDC has leveraged more than $115 million in private investment into downtown Erie, which has built 108 new fully occupied residences, revitalized and created more than 100,000 square feet of new commercial space, and established space for 25 new businesses. Overall, $400 million of long-term capital investment is at work, breathing new life into Downtown Erie.
These investments have a proven track record of revitalizing small businesses and residential areas while fostering innovation in technology and manufacturing — an industry where South Carolina excels. Projects like the South Carolina Technology & Aviation Center (SCTAC) have generated over $6.1 billion in investments and created more than 18,000 new jobs in the local community. This further underscores the significance of Opportunity Zones, which have been and will continue to be impactful.
Additionally, Opportunity Zones have played a significant role in assisting the revitalization of previously overlooked communities, transforming them into economic powerhouses. In Oconee County, South Carolina, investors transformed a textile mill built in 1875 along Lake Hartwell into 197 new residential apartments. The project also incorporated retail and recreational amenities, including the restoration of the historic dam and the creation of public green spaces and trails.
Nationally, Opportunity Zones have generated$89 billionin private investment across more than 5,600 designated communities, and this investment spurred the creation of over 500,000 jobs in the first two years alone. According to a report released in March by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), a bipartisan public policy organization based in Washington, D.C. The legislation also has a far-reaching impact — approximately one in 10 Americans live in an Opportunity Zone. That number could soon grow.

The EIG report also indicates that OZs ""caused an increase of 313,000 new residential addresses (not counting units currently under construction) in designated communities from Q3 2019 to Q3 2024 – roughly doubling the total amount of new housing added to these communities over that period.""
Moreover, the Council of Economic Advisors found that the Opportunity Zone designation alone caused a 3.4% increase in home values in these areas, which translated to an estimated tens of billions of dollars in new wealth for the Opportunity Zone residents who own their homes.
In 2018, the city’s downtown ZIP code, 16501, was named the poorest in Pennsylvania and among the poorest nationwide.  However, through the potential of OZs, the stigma of Pennsylvania’s poorest ZIP code served as a springboard for investment in the area.
By empowering the private sector and cutting red tape, Opportunity Zones enable projects to move more efficiently and at a lower cost while simultaneously addressing one of the most pressing needs in low-income communities – quality affordable housing.
From the very start of the 2017 tax law, we knew the Opportunity Zones initiative would be a gamechanger. It was made for shovel-ready projects in neighborhoods that needed the help the most. As we look ahead to 2025, the future is bright in places like Erie and Oconee County. The EDDC is preparing to break ground on another $22 million project, which includes 37,000 square-feet for commercial office and retail space.

However, if Congress fails to extend TCJA and Opportunity Zones provisions expire, we could see projects years in the making completely upended overnight, along with the largest tax hike in modern history.
It’s critical that Congress extend, expand and make the 2017 tax cuts permanent so working families, small businesses, and communities nationwide can continue to receive the benefits of this legislation – and tax cuts at large – for years to come.

PresidentDonald Trumpcampaigned for a second term on pledges to lower prices, create jobs and impose tough tariffs on imports, especially from China.
Dubbing himself the ""Tariff Man"" last fall, he told an audience at the Economic Club of Chicago, ""To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff."" However, in his first months in office, it is unclear whether Trump can, or should, implement the harsh reciprocal tariffs he announced in April against dozens of countries.
Now, 100 days into his second term, economiststold Fox News Digitalthey see these proposed reciprocal tariffs as politically motivated, unnecessary and failing to secure the benefits from U.S. trading partners that Trump had been hoping for.
CHINA IS ‘CAVING’ TO TRUMP'S TRADE WAR STRATEGY, EXPERT SIGNALS

Instead, they warned, Trump's tariffs could grind billions of dollars in trade to a halt between the world's two largest economies, disrupt global supply chains and risk torpedoing the U.S. economy into a major slump or recession.
When Trump took office, chances of recession ""were probably about 10%,"" Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""Now, they’re up to around 55%.""
It is unclear whether Trump will continue to push through with these unpopular tariffs, which are slated to take force in early July. In the near-term, uncertainty and volatility remain.

Trump announced tariffs on April 2, dubbed ""Liberation Day."" The announcement included both a 10% universal baseline tariff and plans to enact larger tariffs on dozens of other countries, including China.
These new import taxes immediately sent stock markets into free-fall, triggering one of the largest single-day S&P 500 losses since World War II, and prompting deep and unyielding uncertainty over possible next moves.
""The only thing that's happened that has pushed the odds of a recession up so high, so fast, is chaos coming from out of the White House,"" Wolfers said.
Trump subsequently paused the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to encourage the administration to make ""deals"" with countries on trade and encourage more investment in U.S. manufacturing. Even so, some prices have already risen in anticipation of higher costs under the new tariff regime.
Uncertainty has also played a role.Trump's tariff announcementin April prompted a number of large container ships to abruptly halt their shipments to the U.S. earlier this month and turn back to their original ports. This means that more consumers will see a price hike for everyday products, likely at certain big-box retailer stores like Walmart or Target, as early as next month.
These price hikes are ""not showing up tomorrow, but will show up over the next few months, as scarcities develop and American retailers have to find other sources – that might take a while,"" David H. Feldman, an economist and professor at William & Mary, said in an interview.

While Trump says tariffs will target foreign competitors and reduce the trade deficit, the costs will fall mostly on working- and middle-class Americans who buy the bulk of imported goods.
Wolfers said Trump's focus on the trade ""deficit"" is based on a common misconception.
""What that means is we sell China a small amount of stuff, and they sell us a large amount of stuff,"" he explained. However, for every dollar bill that goes to China, the U.S. gets something for it that Americans want to buy, like T-shirts.
""We have a dollar deficit – but we have a stuff surplus.""
There are few signs thatTrump's tariffswill deliver the gains he sought, such as onshoring U.S. production or securing better trade deals, particularly with Asian countries.
Instead, experts warn these countries are likely to circumvent U.S. markets and supply chains over time.
""If these tariffs stay in place, there will be hardly any trade between the U.S. and China,"" by the second half of the year, Gary Clyde Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview.
Roughly $650 billion in annual trade between the two countries is at risk, along with knock-down effects on global commerce in the long term.

Trump's tariffs also discard decades of international understanding that has depoliticized trade disputes, Feldman said.
The U.S. is ""moving from a system that at least was based on mutually acceptable rules of behavior to a system that does not have that as its anchor,"" Feldman, whose research focuses on global trade policy, told Fox News Digital. That shift allows the government to target foreign nations individually and offer selective tariff relief to firms and industries ""if they do ‘our’ bidding,"" he argued.
""America is now master of the shakedown.""

After market backlash, Trump appears to be warming to the idea of easing his proposed 145% reciprocal tariffs on China, which has vowed to impose its own retaliatory measures on U.S. goods.
Economists say he is more likely to do so if the economy sours, or he sees a major drop in poll numbers, if the past is precedent.
Still, any path to deescalation remains uncertain. Just last week, China denied Trump's claim that the two countries were negotiating a tariff deal, after he asserted in an interview that he had reached ""200 deals"" on trade.
Economistsbelieve Trumpwill at least partially scale back the tariffs before July but warn he is playing a high-stakes game of brinkmanship that could hit U.S. consumers and businesses hardest.
""What I worry about is that the immediate impact of uncertainty is on business investment in trade-exposed industries, leading to a recession,"" Feldman said. ""But it could get worse, if it transmits into a financial panic. And  if everyone starts to say, 'geez, I got to get into gold and cash, I can't be in Treasury bills.' If we move into a flight to cash, all bets are off.""
Should that happen, he said, ""We could slide into 2008 all over again.""

Trump has refused to concede that his early days have been anything but a major success.
In a recent interview withTime magazine, he touted his first 100 days as ""very successful,"" saying ""people [are] writing that it was the best first month, and best second month, and really the best third month"" for a U.S. president.
He dismissed stock market volatility and rising inflation as temporary ""market fluctuation,"" calling it a ""transition period"" that would level out.
When asked if he would consider it a win if tariffs remained as high as 50% on imports a year from now, Trump said he would.

PresidentDonald Trumphas championed tariffs as the economic tool that will bring parity to the nation's chronic trade deficit with foreign countries while boosting U.S. jobs and the economy. But many of Trump's tariff polices have been walked back or paused after going into effect.
""I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,"" Trump declared in his inaugural address Jan. 20, teeing up an onslaught of tariff policies that will take effect in the coming weeks and months.
Tariffs are taxeslevied on imported goods and services that historically have contributed to a nation's federal tax revenue. Developed countries, however, have since moved away from relying on tariffs as a main source of federal funding and have shifted to other forms of taxes — such as income, payroll or sales taxes.
On Tuesday, which marked Trump's 100th day back in the Oval Office, Trump signed an executive action easing tariffs targeting car manufacturers as he headed to Michigan, historically the heart of the American auto industry, for a rally celebrating his return to the White House.

The upcoming auto plan will keep a 25% tariff on imported cars and a 25% tariff on imported auto parts but will offer offset credits to U.S. manufacturers for a two-year period in an effort to bolster the U.S. supply chain of car parts and encourage manufacturing in the U.S., according to the administration.
The plan will also not stack both auto and steel and aluminum tariffs on the auto industry. Only the higher tariff will be applied to car manufacturers, not a combined tariff.
The announcement is the latest of Trump walking back, pausing or easing tariffs as he looks to even the trade playing field for the U.S., while encouraging U.S. manufacturing and job creation. Industries that manufacture products on U.S. soil do not face any tariffs.
A White House official who spoke to Fox News Digital explained that while the past few months of tariff changes might seem chaotic in their entirety, each change was born out of a need to be flexible and an effort to bring manufacturing and jobs into the U.S. while ending the nation's chronic trade deficit. The official noted that, as tariffs took effect, many nations and industry leaders have made good-faith efforts to negotiate terms favorable to the U.S., adding to the tariff changes.

Trump's tariff policies overwhelmingly focused on China, Mexico and Canada at the start of his second administration, as he looked to crack down on illegal immigration. It also was an attempt to stem the flow of the deadly synthetic opioid fentanyl, which overwhelmingly originates in China, from coming across the northern and southern borders.
Citing the threat of illegal aliens in the U.S. and the flow of fentanyl, Trump declared a national emergency in February under the International EmergencyEconomic Powers Actand imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% additional tariff on imports from China.
The tariffs sparked swift outrage from the three nations, and Trump paused the tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days after the nations agreed to concessions, such as sending additional security personnel to their respective borders with the U.S.

The tariffs on Mexico and Canada went into effect March 4 after the pause, while the tariffs on China were increased to 20%. A day later, after speaking with auto industry officials from Ford, General Motors and Stellantis, Trump walked back the tariffs if they affected the auto industry, granting a one-month exemption to tariffs ""on any autos"" from the two countries that abide by the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement's rules of origin.
Those rules were established under the first Trump administration, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a  news conference at the time.

On March 6, Trump again walked back the 25% tariffs on many imports from Canada and Mexico while praising Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for helping secure the U.S.-Mexico border. He postponed the tariffs for 30 days and touted that his highly anticipated reciprocal tariff plan would take effect in the coming weeks.

While announcing and imposing tariffs on nations such as Mexico and Canada, Trump previewed a reciprocal tariff plan that would take effect April 2.
""On trade I have decided for purposes of fairness, that I willcharge a reciprocal tariff— meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them no more, no less,"" Trump said at the White House in February. ""In other words, they charge us a tax or tariff, and we charge them the exact same tax or tariff. Very simple.""
Trump announced his highly anticipated reciprocal tariff plan as part of his ""Liberation Day"" announcement April 2. Trump announced customized tariffs on dozens of nations to help bring parity to what he said were decades of foreign nations installingtrade barrierson U.S. goods, while also imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all countries.
""For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating,"" he said. ""And because we are being very kind, we will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us. So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal. I could have done that. Yes. But it would have been tough for a lot of countries.""

The same day the reciprocal tariffs were about to take effect April 9, Trump announced a 90-day pause on the customized duty taxes he had imposed on dozens of nations, which was an abrupt change of course from his previous comments that there would be no pause to those tariffs, only negotiations. The pause did not include the 10% baseline tariff on all nations.
""You have to have flexibility,"" Trump told the media when asked about his credibility after pausing the tariffs. ""I could say there's a wall. ... Sometimes, you have to go around or under the wall. Financial markets change. Look how much they changed. I think the word would be ‘flexible.’ You have to be flexible.""

White House officials told Fox News Digital at the time that dozens of countries had reached out to the White House looking to make good-faith deals, and that the administration was zeroing in on renegotiating more favorable deals for the U.S.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated in recent days thattrade negotiationswith at least South Korea and India are entering the final stages.
Other tariffs, such as a 25% tax on all steel and aluminum imports or the 10% baseline tariff on foreign nations, have remained in effect without change.
Trump has touted that with increased revenue from tariffs, U.S. citizens could see lower taxes and the possible elimination of the income tax.

Trump signed the executive order Tuesday afternoon, Fox Business confirmed, while he was traveling to aMichigan rallynear Detroit — the U.S.' former auto manufacturing capital. Tuesday marks Trump's 100th day in office.
Additionally, domestic auto manufacturers that finish building cars in the U.S. will receive an offset for automobile part tariffs equal to 3.75% of the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price of a manufacturer's U.S. production for the next 12 months and 2.5% of U.S. production for year following. The figures were calculated to reflect the tariff that would be owed when a 25% duty tax is applied to 15% of the value of a U.S.-assembled car, Fox Digital learned.

The 25% tariff oncertain auto partsis set to take effect May 3, with administration officials explaining that auto manufacturers can use the offset credits against the tariff on auto parts. The administration stressed that the offset plan is not a rebate.
TRUMP'S TARIFFS COULD DRIVE UP AUTO REPAIR COSTS, EXPERTS SAY
""A part comes into the country and it gets tariffed,"" a senior Commerce Department official said Tuesday. ""And the auto manufacturers say, ‘Look, I sold a car, I have a credit. I have an offset amount of $1,600. Please use that $1,600 tariff offset amount against this particular part.’ So it will not cost the government any money whatsoever. It is basically allowing them to bring 15% foreign parts and put that in their cars.""

The plan intends to allow all domestic auto manufacturers ""to grow their plants, to grow their employment, and to build more factories in America,"" according to senior Commerce Department officials, by building in a two-year time frame to amp up the U.S. supply chain for the auto industry, according to senior administration officials.

The White House detailed that under the plan, if a car manufacturer builds a vehicle with 85% U.S. parts or parts made under the 2020 United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, they will effectively not owe tariffs.

Democrats must act now,"People in Tennessee, Texas, Washington D.C. and Michigan deliberate the Trump Administration's first 100 days in office.
Are you better off now than you were 100 days ago? My 401(k) sure as hell isn’t.
On January 20, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris left Donald Trump an economy that was outmatching every competitor. In October, The Economist magazine called America’s economy ""the envy of the world,"" praising us for leaving ""other rich countries in the dust.""
But America is nowon trackto have the lowest economic growth and the highest inflation of any leading nation.
In January, Trump guaranteed, ""we will turnthe economyaround very quickly,"" ""the United States is going to take off like a rocket ship,"" and ""inflation"" would fall. He also claimed he’d stand up to a wealthy establishment that was taking advantage of middle-class families.
TRUMP STEAMS AHEAD ON THESE CAMPAIGN PROMISES AS HE REACHES 100 DAYS IN OFFICE
The only promise he kept from those pre-inauguration pledges was to ""turn the economy around very quickly"" -- in the worst way. Trump’s ""rocket ship"" exploded at takeoff. And the only Americans spared from his debris are crony capitalists who are effectively paying himbribes for exemptionsfrom an agenda that is devastating consumers and businesses.
It’s been 100 straight days of breaking his word.
At the Republican National Convention, Trump said, ""I make this pledge to the great people of America. I will end the devastating inflation crisis immediately"" and ""drive down prices.""
Democrats have an opportunity to prove to the American people that we are listening to them; that their top priority -- the economic success of their families -- is also our top priority.
But we’re all paying higher prices because of the biggest middle-class tax hike in modern history --Trump’s tariffs. By definition, a tariff is a regressive tax that disproportionately hurts the non-wealthy. And Trump admits the revenue the government makes from his tariffs will be redistributed to fellow billionaires through the tax plan congressional Republicans are rushing to pass.
SEN. ANGUS KING: A 'DECLARATION OF CONSCIENCE' ON DONALD TRUMP'S 100TH DAY
Trump’s tariff taxes are also killing the manufacturing jobs he claimed they would protect - atMack Truck factoriesin Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania, atauto plants in Michigan and Indiana, and elsewhere. It’s no surprise that amajorityof American manufacturing workers oppose Trump’s tariffs. At the same time, Trump is knifing the policies that actuallyhadbeen revitalizing American manufacturing, like Biden’s bipartisan China competitiveness law and the Inflation Reduction Act.
Trump’s broken promises and self-inflicted economic losses don’t end there. He and congressional Republicans are plotting Medicaid and Affordable Care Act cuts. Trump let the richest man in the world cutSocial Security benefits. Trump’s also slashing the investments that are the lifeblood of our technological and medical innovation edges. All of this is to make room for the tax cuts for the rich that his tariff taxes finance.
And even though the rule of law, American courts, and the independence of the Federal Reserve are critical to keeping the United States as the top economy in the world, Trump is eroding all of those pillars. He’s even raging against judges and other leaders he himself nominated, includingSupreme Courtjustices, law enforcement officials, andFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
Taken together, Trump is weakening our economy so profoundly that he’s setting-off the deadliest exodus of investment away from America since the 1940s. The dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency -- an anchor of our economic strength thatChinaor Russia would literally kill for -- is in crisis and slipping away.
But while most of the country is suffering from this nosedive, Trump and his family are benefitting. They are exploiting their elite private clubs and businesses to sell safety from his economic train wreck -- like immunity from his tariff taxes.
This weekend, as polls from NBC News, The Washington Post, ABC News, the Associated Press, and more all backed upFox’s own pollingabout the unpopularity of Trump’s economic record, news broke that his son, Donald Trump Jr. is starting an exclusive new D.C. club literally called ""Executive Branch.""
Politico reports that this club for the ""ultra-rich"" will ""cater to the business and tech moguls who are looking to nurture their relationships with the Trump administration."" Membership costs $500,000. Days before, Trump himself announced that the top owners of his $TRUMP meme coin would be rewarded with a private dinner at his own D.C. club --generating an estimated $100 millionfor himself.
The Trump Crime Family is practically charging businesses for ""protection"" from itself.

President Trump is double-crossing our nation, rapidly draining the American Dream that every other generation sacrificed to make possible. Which means Democrats have an opportunity to prove to the American people that we are listening to them; thattheirtop priority -- the economic success of their families -- is alsoourtop priority.
We’ll do that by opposing Trump’s price-raising middle-class tax hike that funds welfare for the rich. And by fighting to make the American Dream affordable -- lowering costs likehealth care, child care, and elder care by having billionaires and rich special interests pay their fair share in taxes.
We’ll get Americans together with a shared national mission tomake our economy strongerthan ever by empowering our middle class and ensuring the industries of the future are falling over themselves to invest and build in America -- not running away, like Trump has them doing.
That’s the shake-up we need and deserve.
Democrats will also recognize that the way we communicate -- and especially, the way you make people feel -- is just as important as what we have to say.
That means going everywhere, both online and geographically, across the country. It means being open about who we are on a personal level and proudly owning that the values we’re advocating for are in line with the best traditions of American culture.
SomeDemocrats-- not most, but some -- have mistakenly spent more time tearing America down than lifting it up, and alienating huge swaths of our country with divisive, counter-cultural elitism -- demeaning people of faith or even male voters as a whole. But that is not who we are.
There is nothing more American than pushing for aneconomyand society that provides opportunity and respect for everyone who works hard and plays by the rules. Just like there’s nothing more American than ensuring that elected leaders are subject to the rule of law and held accountable when they violate our rights.
After getting elected based on false promises, Trump is leeching wealth from the middle class. He’s also breaking the law to steal our freedoms, like the right to a fair trial or to disagree with our government.

Speaking of faith, his behavior reminds me of something I learned growing up in the Moravian Church in Winston-Salem,North Carolina: ""Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits.""
The fruits of these 100 days are rotten. So is the political future of congressional Republicans, who continue to choose Trump’s incompetence and corruption over the interests and values of their constituents.

PresidentDonald Trump's poll numbers on the economy have fallen as his administration continues trade negotiations on his wide-ranging reciprocal tariffs approach.
Approximately 55% of Americans think Trump’s policies ""worsened economic conditions in the country,"" according to aCNN poll conducted by SSRSbetween April 17-24. That marked an increase from 51% of respondents who said so when the pollster last asked the same question between March 6-9.
Approximately 60% of Americans believe Trump’s policies have ""affected the cost of living"" in their communities, while just 12% say they think Trump’s policies have decreased the cost of living. The poll found 28% of Americans think Trump’s policies have had no effect on the cost of living in their communities so far.

Just 34% of Americans described themselves as enthusiastic or optimistic about the economy right now, while 66% of respondents said they were pessimistic or afraid. The poll found 69% of Americans believe it is very or somewhat likely the U.S. economy will go into a recession in the next year.
According to the CNN poll, 75% of Americans believe Trump's policies on tariffs will hurt theU.S. economyin the short term, while just 12% said they would help in the short term. Meanwhile, 53% of Americans believe Trump's policies on tariffs will hurt in the long term, while 34% of Americans say they will help in the long term.
A separate poll, conducted byNPR/PBS News/Maristfrom April 21-23, found 45% of Americans give Trump a failing grade as he celebrates his 100th day in office. The pollster said that figure was ""driven mainly by Democrats (80%).""
That survey found 55% of respondents disapprove of how Trump is handling the economy, including 88% of Democrats, 59% of independents, and 17% of Republicans.
With just 39% of Americans approving of his handling of the economy, Trump's overall approval rating sits at 42% – down from the 45% who approved of the job he was doing in March, according to NPR/PBS News/Marist.

About 61% of Americans believe Trump has been ""rushing to make changes"" without considering the consequences of those shifts – a significant uptick from the 56% of respondents who said so in March, according to the pollster.

The Trump administration’s reciprocal tariffs policies and deregulation plans have brought with them significant disturbances in the market.
Joined by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at Tuesday’s briefing commemorating the 100th day, White House press secretaryKaroline Leavittsaid the American people should ""trust President Trump"" on the economy.
""There's a reason he was reelected to this office. It's because of the historic success of his economic formula in the first term,"" Leavitt said. ""There’s a proven formula that works. Massive deregulation, energy independence and tax cuts, which are coming in…. If you want to talk about that, that's a huge deal to put more money back into the pockets of hardworking Americans.""

As for the trade deals, Leavitt said the president is working to right the wrongs ""of the mess that he inherited"" from the Biden administration, as well as a ""mess that has been created for the past four decades that has sold out the middle class.""
""Today, President Trump wants to restore the golden age, and it's a process to do that. And that process is underway,"" Leavitt said.
Bessent said he was working with Republican leadership in the House and the Senate on a new bill that would make the2017 tax cuts permanentand hopefully quell some of the uncertainty in the markets as a result.
""I think one thing that has been a little disconcerting for the market is, you know, President Trump creates what I would call strategic uncertainty in the negotiations. So he is more concerned about getting the best possible trade deals we have for the American people. You know, we had four years of bad deals for decades,"" Bessent said. ""We are going to the unwind those and make them fair.… We've created a process.""

Canadian Conservative LeaderPierre Poilievre is projected to lose the parliamentary seat he has held for more than 20 years in a stunning defeat to Liberal candidate Bruce Fanjoy.
TheCanadian Broadcasting Corporation(CBC), a state-owned outlet, projected the loss on Tuesday morning following Monday’s federal election. However, Elections Canada’s decision to pause the counting of special ballots means it remains unclear whether the Liberals, led by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, will walk away with a minority or majority mandate.

Fanjoy, who is projected to take Poilievre’s seat in Parliament, worked in business and marketing and lives in a carbon-neutral house in Manotick, a suburb of Ottawa, according to CBC.
""We have to look out for ourselves, and we have to take care of each other. Let’s get to work,"" Fanjoy wrote in a post on X.
In his victory speech, Carneyappeared to criticize the U.S.for President Donald Trump’s tariff policies, which he called a ""betrayal.""
""We are over the shock of the American betrayal, but we should never forget the lessons,"" Carney said in his victory speech. ""America wants our land, our resources, our water, our country. These are not idle threats. President Trump is trying to break us so America can own us. That will never ... ever happen.""

Poilievre’s loss comes after a major turn in the polls. At one point, it appeared likely that he would succeed former Canadian Prime MinisterJustin Trudeau. The conservative leader seems to have failed in his effort to make the election a referendum on the controversial former prime minister, whose popularity declined toward the end of his time in office.

Ending theillegal immigration crisisthat spiraled under the Biden administration was one of Trump's top campaign platforms and was a topic he focused on repeatedly during his inaugural address.
""First, I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came. We will reinstate my Remain in Mexico policy,"" Trump declared on Jan. 20.

Trump did sign or authorize executive actions that declared a national emergency, ended catch-and-release policies and sent troops to the U.S. border.
Fox News Digital reported this month that there were fewer apprehensions at the southern border in the entire month of March than across the Biden administration's first two days of March 2024, whenPresident Joe Bidenwas still in the Oval Office.
U.S. Customs and Border Protectionnoted that March was the second consecutive month in which the U.S. Border Patrol averaged its lowest daily nationwide apprehensions in history.
Deportations have also been underway, with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem joining immigration raids since her confirmation in January, as well as the administration placing a heightened focus on deporting illegal immigrants with known ties to violent gangs, such as Tren de Aragua and MS-13. The State Department designated both gangs asforeign terrorist organizationsin February.
Trump invoked a wartime act, the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, to carry out the deportations, which allows deportation of natives and citizens of an enemy nation without a hearing. The act had been invoked three times before, including, during the War of 1812, World War I andWorld War II.

""Our liberties and our nation’s glorious destiny will no longer be denied. And we will immediately restore the integrity, competency, and loyalty of America’s government,"" Trump said during his inaugural address.
""To restore competence and effectiveness to our federal government, my administration will establish the brand-new Department of Government Efficiency,"" he added.
Trump signed an executive order in January establishing DOGE, renaming the Obama-era United States Digital Service to the United States DOGE Service.

DOGE has since savedan estimated $160 billion through cancellations of government contracts, grant cancellations, workforce reductions, asset sales and other cuts, according to the DOGE website.
Trump also signed an executive order closing down the Department of Education, citing how American students have fallen behind other nations in education, and instead charged individual states to hold authority over public education. The administration also effectively shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development, an independent government agency charged with administering economic aid to foreign nations, as DOGE uncovered a slew of programs U.S. taxpayers funded and Musk slammed the group as a ""viper’s nest of radical-left Marxists who hate America.""

Trump entered office just days after Israel and Hamas declared a ceasefire in a war that had raged since Oct. 7, 2023, as well as an ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine.
""My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier. That’s what I want to be: a peacemaker and a unifier,"" Trump said during his inaugural address. ""I’m pleased to say that as of yesterday, one day before I assumed office, the hostages in the Middle East are coming back home to their families.""
Trump vowed while on the campaign trail that he would end the wars in the Middle East as well as between Russia and Ukraine, adding that if he had been in office for the 2020-2024 term, neither war would have launched.
The majority of hostages Hamas held have since been released, with the terrorist group still holding at least 59 living or deceased hostages. A final hostage and permanent ceasefire deal, however, has not yet been reached, with Reuters reporting earlier in April that Hamas wants to strike a deal to end the war and return the remaining hostages.

He also added that Zelenskyy ""went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October"" and that he should ""offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country.""
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier this month that the U.S. might ""move on"" from trying to secure a deal between Russia and Ukraine if progress was not made.
""We are now reaching a point where we need to decide whether this is even possible or not,"" Rubio said on April 18 while speaking with the media. ""Because if it’s not, then I think we’re just going to move on. It’s not our war. We have other priorities to focus on.""
Trump met with Zelenskyy on Saturday at the Vatican as the pair attended Pope Francis' funeral mass.

Rubio said on Sunday during an appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the coming week will be ""very critical"" as theWhite House weighswhether it wants to continue working towards a peace deal. Rubio warned earlier this month that the U.S. might ""move on"" from trying to secure a deal between Russia and Ukraine if progress was not made.
""I think this is going to be a very critical week,"" Rubio said on Sunday. ""This week is going to be a really important week in which we have to make a determination about whether this is an endeavor that we want to continue to be involved in or if it's time to sort of focus on some other issues that are equally, if not more, important in some cases. But we want to see it happen. There are reasons to be optimistic, but there are reasons to be realistic, of course, as well. We're close, but we're not close enough.""

Ahead of winning re-election in November, Trump floated that he would shutter the Department of Education to overall improve the nation's school systems, as well as remove diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) curricula from public schools.
Trump reflected in his inaugural address that he was on the verge ofoverhauling an education systemthat teaches students to ""be ashamed of themselves"" as well as ""hate our country.""
""And we have an education system that teaches our children to be ashamed of themselves — in many cases, to hate our country despite the love that we try so desperately to provide to them. All of this will change starting today, and it will change very quickly,"" Trump said during his inaugural address.
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SIGNIFICANTLY DISMANTLED IN NEW TRUMP EXECUTIVE ORDER
Trump signed an executive order in March to dismantle the Department of Education and return oversight power of school systems to state leaders after years of the U.S. dragging behind other nations such as Finland and Japan in overall student performance.
""Everybody knows it's right, and we have to get our children educated,"" Trump said while signing the executive order. ""We're not doing well with the world of education in this country, and we haven't for a long time.""
Trump also signed an executive order in January that removes federal funding from K-12 schools that teach critical race theory andDEI curriculum.
""In many cases, innocent children are compelled to adopt identities as either victims or oppressors solely based on their skin color and other immutable characteristics. In other instances, young men and women are made to question whether they were born in the wrong body and whether to view their parents and their reality as enemies to be blamed. These practices not only erode critical thinking but also sow division, confusion, and distrust, which undermine the very foundations of personal identity and family unity,"" the executive order, ""Ending Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling,"" reads.
Trump also signed an executive order in February that prohibits schools and colleges that receive federal funds and are subject to Title IX from allowing men ontowomen's sports teamsand into women's locker rooms, and another in January expanding school choice.

""The inflation crisis was caused by massive overspending and escalating energy prices, and that is why today I will also declare a national energy emergency. We will drill, baby, drill,"" Trump said during his inaugural address.
He added that ""America will be a manufacturing nation once again,"" and that the administration ""will bring prices down"" with the aid of unleashing American energy, such as oil and coal.
Inflation has eased since 2024, with the March annual inflation rate falling to 2.4% from 2.8% in February, according to theU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS). The annual inflation rate in March 2024 stood at 3.5%.
The U.S. job market added 151,000 jobs in February, and 228,000 jobs in March, while the unemployment rate sits at 4.2% as of last month, according to BLS data. The unemployment rate sat at 3.9% in March 2024 under the Biden administration.
""The prices are going down, not going up. One of the big things is, energy is going down. I see that we had a couple of states where gasoline was at $1.98 a gallon. Nobody thought they'd see that for years,"" Trump said from the Oval Office on April 22 when asked about costs picked up by Americans at the checkout line.

""I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,"" Trump declared during his inauguration speech in January.
""For this purpose, we are establishing the External Revenue Service to collect all tariffs, duties, and revenues. It will be massive amounts of money pouring into our Treasury, coming from foreign sources,"" he added.
On April 2, Trump announced his administration's reciprocal, customized tariff plan to be imposed on dozens of nations as part of his highly-anticipated Liberation Day event. The plan aims to bring parity to the country's chronic trade deficit.

On April 9, when the tariff plan took effect, Trump abruptly changed course and put the reciprocal tariff plan on ice for 90 days. China, however, was not spared from the pause and was instead hit with a 125% after the Asian nation retaliated against the U.S. with its own tariffs.
A tariff negotiation blitz is now underway as nations across the world look to book meetings with the White House to iron out more favorable terms. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent lauded South Korea specifically last week for its negotiations, saying talks have progressed quickly and that the two countries could reach a trade agreement as early as this week.

""We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today,"" Bessent said from the White House on Thursday. ""We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week.""
""So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game, and we will see if they follow through on that,"" Bessent continued.
Concerns have mounted that the tariffs will cause American consumers to spend more at the checkout lines. Trump said during his speech to a joint session of Congress in March that there will be ""a little disturbance"" with the tariffs, but that America will be made ""rich again"" through the plan.

""Tariffs are about making America rich again and making America great again. And it’s happening, and it will happen rather quickly,"" Trump said in his Marchaddress to Congress. ""There will be a little disturbance, but we’re okay with that. It won’t be much.""
Trump said earlier this month that there is a ""real chance"" tariffs couldreplace income tax.
""There's a real chance,"" Trump said in an interview with Fox News' Rachel Campos-Duffy. ""There is a chance that the money from tariffs could be so great that it would replace. You know, in the old days, about 1870 to 1913, the tariffs were the only form of money. And that's when our nation was relatively the richest. We were the richest.""
The president said during the interview that there was a committee formed in the 1880s to ""get rid of money.""",4/29/2025
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-steams-ahead-campaign-promises-he-reaches-100-days-office,Trump steams ahead on these campaign promises as he reaches 100 days in office,"'Outnumbered' panelists discuss the Trump administration's latest efforts to crack down on illegal immigration after Tom Homan touted 'the most secure border in the history of this nation.'
PresidentDonald Trumpis now at the finish line of his first 100 days of his second term in the White House, as of Tuesday.
Key tenets of Trump’s first 100 days include imposing harsh tariffs on Chinese imports, starting and continuing peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, unveiling plans to dismantle organizations like the Education Department and cracking down on border security amid a mass deportation initiative.
The period also marked a steep increase in executive orders in comparison to previous presidents. Altogether, Trump has signed over 140 executive orders during his first 100 days in office during his second term. That is an increase from the 33 he signed during the first 100 days of his first term, and up from the previous record of 99 that former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed during that same timeframe.
The Trump administration’smass deportation effort is in full force, and border czar Tom Homan told reporters Monday that border crossings were down by 96% under the Trump administration.

Additionally, the White House said earlier in April it has deported more than 100,000 illegal immigrants in 2025. The administration’s handling of these deportations has attracted scrutiny in certain high-profile cases, including one involving El Salvador native Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the Trump administration claimed in court filings was deported by mistake.
However, the Trump administration has since said Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang and has released protective order documents from his wife.
Following through on another campaign promise, the Trump administration unveiled sweeping tariffs against a host of countries on April 2, after historically lambasting other countries' trade practices and accusing them of engaging in unfair trade practices against the U.S.
""For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,"" Trump said April 2 at the White House.
The administration later walked back its initial proposal, and announced April 9 it would immediately hike tariffs on Chinese goods to 145% but scale back reciprocal tariffs on other countries for 90 days to a baseline of 10%. In response, China proceeded to boost its tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%.
Additionally, Trump signed an executive order on March 20 to overhaul the Education Department — following through on a campaign promise he made to eliminate the federal government’s influence over education and ""stop the abuse of your taxpayer dollars to indoctrinate America’s youth.""

A White House fact sheet on the executive order said the directive aims to ""turn over education to families instead of bureaucracies"" and instructs Education Secretary Linda McMahon to ""take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education and return education authority to the States, while continuing to ensure the effective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely.""
Still, Trump revealed that functions of the department overseeing Pell Grants, student loans and others that provide services for those with special needs would continue at other agencies.
Likewise, Trump has long called for an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and promised to end the conflict between the two within 24 hours during his time on the campaign trail.

Still, he has continued to advance negotiations during his first 100 days in office — including hosting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to the White House in February.

Today, April 29, 2025, isPresident Donald Trump’s 100th dayin office. The liberal media, which has underestimated and misrepresented this president for the past decade, would have us believe that his second term so far has been a disaster. Many of us who voted for Trump disagree.
Pollsters tell us that Trump’s approval ratings are in free fall. Critics (and the president) suggest some polls don’t pass the smell test. GOP pollster John McLaughlin reports that in the new NY Times/Siena poll, which showed Trump with a meager 42% approving of how the president is handling his job, only 37% of the survey group voted for Trump in 2024.
The recent ABC/Washington Post poll showed Trump at 39% approval – ""The Lowest in 80 Years"" blared a headline – but included, according to McLaughlin, only 34% Trump voters. As McLaughlin asked pointedly on Truth Social, ""Didn’t we win popular vote with 50%?""
SEC. BESSENT SAYS TRADE DEALS ARE 'MOVING VERY QUICKLY': PARTNERS BROUGHT 'THEIR A GAME'
A firm called Quantus Insights, that claims to have achieved better accuracy than most polling outfits in 2024, shows in a recent survey that Trump still commands 91% backing from Republicans and that his overall approval is still about 48%, higher than most other surveys.

Still, Trump’s support has undeniably softened, and no wonder. Economists tell us that prices are set to soar, the U.S. is likely to tumble into recession, a ""supply shock is coming"" and thatthe dollar is under attack.
Never mind that inflation has eased over the past two months and actually turned negative in March.  Never mind that the jobs market remains solid and that Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan recently told Bret Baier on Fox News that ""consumers are still spending.""
The end is near, we are told, all because Trump is attempting something that should have happened a decade or two ago: he is trying to make America competitive again. He is trying to undo the damage done by allowing China to join the World Trade Organization, looking the other way while China broke everyrule meant to promote fair trade(Thank you Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama.) and by a series of trade agreements that allowed U.S. companies to ship jobs overseas.
The liberal media’s take on Trump’s tariff battle is relentlessly and universally negative. Isn’t there anyone who worries that the U.S. is dependent on Chinese industry and pharmaceuticals? Isn’t anyone irate that America’s EU allies put 10% tariffs on U.S. autos while we impose only a 2.5% tariff on BMWs and Volvos? Does anyone see any upside at all to the Trump trade agenda?
Why yes, it turns out that possibly a great many people agree with the president’s actions. Pollster Frank Luntz convened a group of some 15 Trump voters recently, taking their pulse on the rocky past few weeks and expecting them to blast their elected leader, especially on tariffs and the stock market downturn.
Luntz seemed surprised to find out that the Trump voters remained solidly in the president’s camp. On predicted tariff-generated price hikes, they said they were willing to pay more for goods made in the U.S. and supported trying to bring home production. On the stock market, they observed that markets go up and down, and that there had been corrections even under President Joe Biden.
Overall, the group appeared willing to give Trump time to work through his agenda, noting that it was only a few months into his term, and that he had three and a half years to go.
That is certainly not the view of the liberal press, which has fought Trump every step of his political journey. Whether it was pushing our NATO allies to up their defense spending or calling out China for breaking trade rules and stealing our intellectual property, or advocating for a border wall, the establishment fought him until voters took his side.
The end is near, we are told, all because Trump is attempting something that should have happened a decade or two ago: he is trying to make America competitive again.
Trump does not have much time. Since he can serve for only four years, and since he might lose the GOP majority in Congress in less than two years, he entered the Oval Office moving at what is now called Trump Speed on a host of initiatives. He is giving Democrats heartburn by tackling so many ambitions at once.
Of 31 main campaign promises, even The Washington Post has had to acknowledge that he has made progress on all but eight, and that summary is dishonest. Of the eight described as ""Hasn’t Happened,"" the promise to ""cut taxes"" and ""eliminate taxes on tips and overtime"" is clearly ""underway"" (another category) as Congress works toward a reconciliation bill.

The Post points out that numerous initiatives face ""roadblocks,"" with judges stepping in to deny progress on ending birthright citizenship and cutting funds to sanctuary cities; some of these proposals will succeed, others will not. Trump supporters will cut him some slack for not being able to overcome judicial interference.
But they will also applaud those promises that Trump is quickly moving to fulfill: expanding oil and gas production, rolling back destructive environmental regulations, eliminating offensive race and gender curriculms in schools, preventing girls from having to compete in sports with biological males and drastically reducing the flow of people entering our country illegally.
These policies offend the liberal establishment, but that isn’t the group that elected Trump. Working-class, common-sense Americans voted for Donald Trump and for the most part I’m guessing that – like the Luntz sample – they like what he is doing.

For sure, because the president has taken on such a boatload of initiatives, mistakes have been made. The roll-out of the tariff program, in particular, was choppy and has created uncertainty. But if the White House can ink deals with India, Japan and South Korea in the next month or so, those wins will calm markets and cheer voters.
Trump should continue to deliver on his campaign promises.  The polling will take care of itself… and become great again.

""I think we're doing really well,"" Trump told reporters last week.
The president, as he neared the100-day markinto his second administration, predicted that ""we're going to be the strongest that we've ever been as a nation.""
Trump has aggressively asserted executive authority in his second term, overturning long-standing government policy and making major cuts to the federal workforce through an avalanche of sweeping and controversial executive orders and actions – with some aimed at addressing grievances he has held since his first term.

However, thelatest poll numberssuggest that Americans are not overly thrilled with the job Trump's doing steering the nation.
The president stands at 44% approval and 55% disapproval in the most recent Fox News national poll, which was conducted April 18-21.
The president's numbers are also underwater in polls released the past few days by ABC News/Washington Post (42% approval-55% disapproval), New York Times/Siena College (42%-54%), CNN (43%-57%), Reuters/Ipsos (42%-53%), Pew Research (40%-59%), and AP/NORC (39%-59%)
Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president'spoll positionwhen he started his second tour of duty in the White House.

Contributing to the drop are increasing concerns over the economy and inflation, which were pressing issues that kept former PresidentJoe Biden’sapproval ratings well below water for most of his presidency. Additionally, Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement earlier this month, which sparked a trade war with some of the nation's top trading partners, triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets and increased concerns about a recession.
Trump's approval rating on the economy stands at 38% in the Fox News poll, with just a third of respondents approving of the job he is doing handling inflation and tariffs.

The Fox News poll is the latest to indicate a massive partisan divide over Trump.
Nearly nine-in-10 Republicans questioned gave the president a thumbs-up, with 90% of Democrats disapproving of the job Trump's doing. Nearly three-quarters of Independents also disapprove of the president's performance in office.
Daron Shaw, who serves as a member of the Fox News Decision Team and is the Republican partner on the Fox News poll, noted ""the consolidation of the Republican base.""

""The party’s completely solidified behind him,"" added Shaw, a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas, who pointed out that Trump’s current solid GOP support was not the case at the start of the first term, when he had trouble with some Republicans.
However, Trump's overall approval rating is close to where he stood 100 days into his first term in office, in 2017, when he stood at 45% approval in Fox News polling.

So how does Trump stack up against his presidential predecessors?
""John F. Kennedy and Dwight Eisenhower had the highest first-quarter average ratings, with both registering above 70%, while Jimmy Carter, Barack Obama and Ronald Reagan averaged between 60% and 69%. George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, Joe Biden and Bill Clinton had similar average ratings of 55% to 58% in their first quarters,"" Gallup noted in a poll released two weeks ago on presidential approval ratings.
Gallup highlighted that ""Trump is the only president to have sub-50% average approval ratings during a first quarter in office.""
However, enjoying promising approval ratings out of the gate does not guarantee a positive and productive presidency.
Carter's poll numbers sank into negative territory less than two years into his presidency, and he was resoundingly defeated in his bid for re-election in 1980.

However, Biden's numbers sank into negative territory in the late summer and autumn of 2021, in the wake of his much-criticized handling of the turbulent U.S.exit from Afghanistanand amid soaring inflation and a surge of migrants crossing into the U.S. along the nation's southern border with Mexico.
Biden's approval ratings stayed underwater throughout the rest of his presidency, and he dropped his bid for re-election last summer.
""He just got crippled and never recovered,"" Shaw said of Biden.

Amidst his tariff and trade policy discussion, PresidentDonald Trumptook some time to meet with executives from some of the country’s top retailers, from home improvement giants Home Depot and Lowe’s to mass retailers Target and Walmart, to discuss the impact of trade policy on their businesses.
While big businesses, billionaires and Wall Street regularly get an audience with presidents, Main Street is too often left out.
The Trump administration has repeatedly said they want to be Main Street first. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent notably said, ""for the next four years, the Trump agenda is focused on Main Street.It’s Main Street’s turn.It’s Main Street’s turn to hire workers. It’s Main Street’s turn to drive investment, and it’s Main Street’s turn to restore the American Dream.""

And, just as this administration opened up press briefings to include new media, the president should have a regular audience with members of the Main Street small business community.
President Trump has made time to talk over issues with big business. Now, he needs to make time to hear the concerns of small businesses. FILE: Afternoon sunlight shines on the historic core of downtown Independence.(iStock)
Small business is big businessfor America, which is why it is often referred to as the backbone of the U.S. economy. Per Small Business Administration statistics, there are nearly 35 million small businesses, compared to less than 20,000 big businesses. Small businesses account for around half of the private economy and create the majority of new jobs.
However, as small businesses are spread out across geographies, demographics, industries and sizes, they don’t garner as much attention in Washington. There are fantastic individual advocates as well as advocacy organizations like NFIB (National Federation of Independent Business), the S Corporation Association, the NSBA (National Small Business Association), the SBE Council (Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council) and many industry-specific organizations, among others, that should receive as many invitations to economic discussions as the bigger players.
Small businesses have been shouldering the fallout of government mandates for half a decade. First, state and local COVID-19 mandates shut down and negatively impacted millions of small businesses, for which the poorly designed PPP program did not fully compensate.
On the back of the COVID mandates, long-term disruptions occurred to supply chains and labor markets which further hurt small businesses. Then, historic inflation under the Biden administration put even more pressure on small businesses and their customers.
While small companies were optimistic for theMain Street-first Trump administration,expecting deregulation and tax certainty to help boost their business growth, millions of small businesses are instead fighting yet another government-imposed battle with tariffs.
Whether a small business has part or all of their supply chain abroad, has domestic suppliers with exposure to foreign supply chains or customers cutting back on spending and investment due to market and economic uncertainty, they are being hurt financially.

And while big companies like Apple were granted a temporary clawback in their tariff exposure, decreasing China-sourced tariffs for smartphones, computers and chips from 145% to 20%, millions of small businesses did not receive any relief. Apple has tens of billions of dollars in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet; small businesses do not have such balance sheet leverage.
While understanding the needs of companies like Apple and Walmart is important, it is just as important to understand the needs of small companies throughout the country.
Small businesses have been shouldering the fallout of government mandates for half a decade. First, state and local COVID-19 mandates shut down and negatively impacted millions of small businesses, for which the poorly designed PPP program did not fully compensate.

In fact, almost all small businesses that I speak with want very little from the government except to be left to do their business without government interference. They want to exist on the same playing field as everyone else and not have government-imposed barriers, regulations and challenges put in their path at every turn.
To understand these challenges, President Trump should invite more small businesses and their advocates to the White House. If Main Street is going to thrive, it needs to start with small businesses, and that reality should grant small businesses a seat at the table.

The Trump administration is also seeking to terminate half of HUD’s staff and defund programs that have vexed America since the launch of Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society.
Andrew Cuomo, former New York governor and Bill Clinton’s last HUD secretary, admitted in 1998 that HUD had been ""the poster child for failed government."" In 1976, Detroit City Council president (and future U.S. senator) Carl Levin denounced the agency as ""Hurricane HUD"" for ravaging the Motor City with reckless subsidized mortgages with stratospheric default rates.

HUD PUTS HALF-OCCUPIED HEADQUARTERS BUILDING IN DC UP FOR SALE
Gross negligence has always been HUD’s standard operating procedure. In 2011, the Washington Postcompiled hundreds of satellite images to prove thatHUD’s largest homebuilding programwas a ""dysfunctional system that delivers billions of dollars to local housing agencies with few rules, safeguards or even a reliable way to track projects.""
HUD claimed to have no idea that billions of dollars of its grants had been misused or plundered and ignored a barrage of complaints from individuals whose neighborhoods were ravaged. HUD left a ""trail of failed developments in every corner of the country. Fields where apartment complexes were promised are empty and neglected,"" the Post noted.

During the 1990s, I spent many days at HUD headquarters investigating boondoggles. HUD was overstocked with the most depressed employees you would ever meet outside of a group therapy session in a city jail. After I wrote a Wall Street Journal piece headlined ""Clinton’s Wrecking Ball for Suburbs,"" HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros denounced me for ""unfortunate stereotyping of assisted-housing residents.""
But not nearly as unfortunate as subsequentHUD-financed violent crime wavesacross the nation. In the first half of 2016, at least 30 people were killed at Section 8 residences in Chicago - along with 7,000 other reported crimes.
TRUMP STOPPED BIDEN’S PLAN TO FORCE DEI ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES
In Houston, male Section 8 recipients are twice as likely to commit violent crimes as people with similar backgrounds and incomes who did not receive housing vouchers, according to a Texas A&M University study. A HUD-financed study found that Section 8 relocations ""tripled the rate of arrests for property crimes"" among boys who moved to new locales.

Russell Vought, Trump’s Office of Management & Budget chief,derided Section 8 because it ""brings with it crime, decreased property values, and results in dependency and subsidized irresponsibility."" The Trump administration is expected to propose severe cuts in rental subsidies for next year’s budget.
When Congress created HUD in 1965, it was supposed to bring social justice toAmerican cities. But Sandra Thompson, Biden’s Federal Housing Finance Agency chief, testified to Congress in 2022 that the racial homeownership gap ""is higher today than when the Fair Housing Act [of 1968] was passed.""
The Biden administration sought to ""fix"" that problem with a new mandate to punish mortgage borrowers with good credit ratings by forcing them to subsidize borrowers with shaky records of paying their bills. But ""No Deadbeats Left Behind"" is a poor maxim for mortgage policies.

Secretary Turner is ready to abandon HUD headquarters, declaring that that agency’s focus is on ""creating a workplace that reflects the values of efficiency, accountability and purpose."" That 12-story building needs a half billion dollars in ""deferred maintenance and modernization"" expenses and costs more than $50 million a year to operate – despite being perennially half empty even before Trump’s mass firings. The maintenance and modernization costs far exceed the original cost of the building in inflation-adjusted dollars.
HUD’s faltering headquarters could be far more valuable for a symbolic gesture than for a real estate payout.
Donald Trumpshould take a page from the most dramatic housing intervention of the last 60 years. In 1954, St. Louis opened one of the nation’s largest public housing projects, with 33 high-rise apartment buildings. But the Pruitt-Igoe project soon became hopelessly marred by crime and vandalism. The 1972 film footage of the entire project being demolished should have been required viewing in every high school civics class in the nation.

A heavily publicized demolition of HUD headquarters would provide a more valuable lesson for Americans than any sale price the faltering building fetched. For 60 years, HUD reaped massive congressional appropriations regardless of the havoc it sowed. Razing HUD would remind all federal agencies that failure has consequences.
And seeing HUD headquarters topple down would gratify everyone who wants todrain the D.C. swampand everyone whose home value or neighborhood was blighted by HUD.

For the past decade, our nation’s one-size-fits-all policyapproach to homelessness, Housing First, has sought to offer lifelong housing to every homeless American – without funding or mandates for addiction and mental health treatment, job training, or life-skills development.

Forced upon us by overzealous bureaucrats who assured it would eliminate homelessness within a decade, the policy has instead fueled the crisis. Many frontline leaders foresaw its failure, but we could not have imagined the full scale of devastation it would unleash.
WHY BLUE STATE POLICIES ARE CAUSING EVEN MORE HOMELESSNESS IN AMERICA
Homelessness has eruptedinto a full-blown catastrophe, reaching its highest point in recorded history, with bodies sprawled throughout America’s streets, lives lost daily and communities unraveling.
Far from fostering stability, Housing First has institutionalized dependency – at the individual level, within the nonprofit sector and among local policymakers.
Those struggling with homelessness face three primary deficits that keep them stuck:
Deficit of Income:While seemingly obvious, homeless individuals often lack the capability to earn enough to meet their basic needs. Without intervention, they remain in a cycle of poverty. We must help the homeless grow their earnings through job training and financial literacy programs, enabling them to live within their means.

HOMELESS PEOPLE NEED MORE THAN A HOUSE. THEY NEED SOMETHING MONEY CAN'T BUY
Deficit of Support:If you or I were to become homeless tomorrow, we would have family and friends to lean on for a hand-up. Not so for most people on the streets. They often have no support network. We must help them repair or rebuild their support systems – offering ongoing encouragement and guidance – so they are not left to struggle alone.
Deficit of Purpose:Human beings are designed for purpose. Those experiencing homelessness may have lost their way, but they have not lost the intrinsic purpose for which they were designed. We must help them rediscover their value to reignite their sense of self-worth.
Too often, it is suggested thataffordable housingis the silver bullet. It is not.
Housing alone does nothing to address the income, support and purpose deficits that accompany homelessness.
Homelessness is a health and human services emergency – deeply linked to mental health, substance abuse and individual well-being.

I’M A BLUE STATE MAYOR AND THE FUTURE OF HOMELESSNESS SCARES ME
Human First programs like the one I led for 13 years – Northern California’s largest program for homeless women and children – prove that addressing these issues and others that often accompany homelessness yields lasting results.
By integrating treatment,job training, life-skills and accountability with temporary housing, thousands of formerly addicted single mothers achieved sobriety, secured employment and some even became California homeowners.
Our $19,000 annual cost per person was a fraction of the short-term expense, and a substantial reduction in the long-term public burden that creates massive strain on public systems.
Homeless individuals with untreated addiction and mental illness cost taxpayers between $30,000 and $50,000 annually in emergency services, health care and law enforcement expenses.
To reverse this crisis, we must dismantle the disastrous federal mandates that have shackled the homeless, local communities and innovation.
THESE CITIES' FEIGNED COMPASSION MAKING DRUG AND HOMELESSNESS CRISES WORSE
Housing Secretary Scott Turner’s bold proposal to slash HUD’s bureaucracy and redirect its focus is a vital step. Massive cuts to the agency’s inefficiency and rigidity will empower local governments with the flexibility to create tailored, results-driven solutions.
Equally promising is the idea of block-granting homelessness funds directly to states – or better yet, counties. Counties, as frontline providers ofhealth and human services, are best positioned to deliver precise, accountable care. Unlike states, counties have granular, real-time insights into their communities’ needs and can implement nimble, localized solutions.
Moreover, routing funds through counties rather than states ensures that every dollar stretches further as each layer of bureaucracy siphons off resources. By directing funding to the county level, we reduce administrative waste and ensure resources swiftly reach those in need.
However, these reforms, alone, will not reverse the nation’s crisis.

For 11 years, state and county officials have been under HUD’s thumb, forced to implement Housing First as homelessness,overdose deathsand public disorder surged in their communities, constrained in challenging it for fear of losing funding.
Secretary Turner must also consider how to equip local leaders who are lost when it comes to ways to quickly and effectively reverse their metastasizing crisis.
Homelessness is far more than a moral dilemma. It is a national emergency with profound economic, social and security implications at every level of government.

As we champion border security and streamlined government functions, we must recognize that helping the homeless become productive is not only fundamental to their success – it is equally fundamental to ours.
The more individuals we restore, the stronger we become as a nation. In empowering the homeless to rebuild their lives, we are rebuilding America – one restored life at a time.

Legendary economist Art Laffer admitted on Wednesday he’s terrified of PresidentDonald Trump’s tariffs, though he said he’s hopeful that Trump will reduce them once he secures some trade deals.
In an interview with Axios, Laffer said that Trump’s protectionist policies have ushered in the ""most scary, in-flux"" economic moment he’s ever seen.
""I don't know how anyone looking at the facts could argue that protectionism doesn't create downturns,"" hetold the outlet, adding, ""The more protectionism there is, the greater the downturn. Reducing tariffs and protectionism causes a boom in the economy.""

Despite the criticism, the Reagan-era economist has been a fan of Trump over the years. He referred to him as ""a great negotiator"" as well as the ""single best president of his lifetime.""
Trump awarded Laffer with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2019 for his economic theory – dubbed the ""Laffer curve"" – that shaped President Ronald Reagan’s tax cuts as well as those implemented inTrump’s first term.
While generally supportive of Trump, the economist has been sounding the alarm over the reciprocal tariffs the president placed on imports from multiple countries earlier this month, before the administration announceda 90-day pause.

""Once you screw around with supply chains, production facilities, all of that, it's very hard to reverse that,"" Laffer told Axios.
He also referred to the tariffs as a ""perverse government response"" that ""is a sure-fire way of causing an economic bust.""
Still, Laffer expressed hope that Trump could make the policy work, as long as he makes good deals and reduces tariffs immediately after.
""You will find out with whether I'm right to be scared or right to be hopeful probably in 90 days — there's not a lot of time,"" he said, referencing Trump’s pause on all tariffs except for those affecting China.

In an interview withFox News Channelearlier this month over the 90-day pause, Laffer seemed to express a more optimistic view of how Trump was leveraging tariffs.
""It’s Trump at his very best, Martha,"" he said. ""You know, I was hoping, and I believed, that he was going to be able to do this – although I always have trepidations 'cause I’m a wuss. I’m afraid.""

Laffer continued, ""But he, boy, he knows how to do these negotiations and he’s going to eliminate a very serious problem of all these foreign tariffs, and non-tariff barriers and quotas against us, and we are the freest trade country. And now he’s going to bring ‘em back in and really bring down their barriers to trade. And we’re going to have a much freer trade world.""

A new bill in theGolden Statewould allow homeless community college and state university students to sleep in their cars during the blue state's housing crisis.
APublic Policy Institute of Californiareport found California has among the lowest homeownership rates and the most expensive housing in the U.S., with rent about 50% higher than the national median.
The California billseeks to provide a short-term solution to the state's decades-long housing strife.
Assemblymember Corey Jackson, a progressive California Democrat with a doctorate in social work,proposed a bill in Marchthat would require the chancellors of the California state universities and the governing board of each community college district to develop an overnight parking program with ""basic needs coordinators and campus security"" by late 2026.

""This bill confronts a harsh reality to many of our students who are sleeping in their vehicles or other displaced settings as they are unable to find affordable housing, and that's jeopardizing their education,"" Jackson said. ""What I am proposing is practical, immediate relief, overnight parking programs that turn campus lots into safe, temporary havens while the state works on lasting solutions.""

Almost three out of five California community college students are housing insecure and one in four are homeless, a survey conducted by theCommunity College League of California in 2023 found.

""We are in a housing crisis. We are in a homelessness crisis, and it's not an either or approach. It's a both and all of the above approach,"" Jackson said.
Many legislative proposals in California this year seek to fund student housing or cut through building regulation red tape, but Jackson aims to provide immediate relief for college students grappling with the housing crisis.
Jackson, who acknowledged stakeholders' disapproval of his bill,proposed a similar oneduring last year's legislative session, but it failed. Its 2025 version, however, passed the Assembly Higher Education Committee this year.

The bill has yet to face its first committee review and is already grabbing national attention as conservatives and progressives question what's happening to California's housing market.
""After wrecking affordability in California, Democrats have nothing left but bad ideas,"" California Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""They’re now proposing to let students sleep in cars because they can’t fix the housing crisis they created. This isn’t innovation. It’s desperation from a party that spent decades raising costs, blocking new housing and wasting billions on programs that failed. Letting students live in parking lots isn’t a solution. It’s proof their policies have completely collapsed.""
When reached for comment by Fox News Digital, Newsom's office said it does not typically comment on pending legislation.
""California is bucking not only national increases but reversing long-term trends in the state from decades of inaction prior to this administration. California’s progress in addressing homelessness is outperforming the nation,"" a Newsom spokesperson said.
Newsom's office,citing 2024 records, stressed that homelessness is increasing nationwide by more than 18%, while California's national trend is closer to 3%, lower than 40 other states. Newsom also touted the state's more than 71,000 year-round shelter beds, which a spokesperson said is double the amount created during the 5-year period prior to the Newsom administration.

But that hasn't stopped the criticism of Jackson's bill. Fox News contributorHugh Hewittslammed the policy on ""America's Newsroom.""
""The problem in California is there are not enough homes and apartments. It's a supply problem created over 50 years of no-growth, left-wing policies that are anti-housing. The solution is not to create homeless encampments, and each one of these will become that,"" Hewitt said. ""People are going to enroll in the community college for 18 bucks a credit, and then they're going to put their car in the community college parking lot.""
Hewitt said these are the types of polices that drove people like him out of California ""because it's simply a broken state"" with a ""deep blue supermajority"" and no ideas about how to build houses.

Hartnett was referring to Gov.Gavin Newsom'spodcast, which features a revolving door of Trump allies and conservative guests, including Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, in an attempt to show he is open to ""criticism and debate without demeaning or dehumanizing one another.""

President Donald Trump’ssweeping tariffs are facing a major legal challenge from New York and 11 other states, who argue the president overstepped his authority and put the U.S. economy at risk by imposing them without congressional approval.
Filed in the U.S. Court ofInternational Trade,the lawsuit challenges Trump’s use of emergency powers under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on imports from countries worldwide.""Once again, Democrats like Letitia James are prioritizing a witch hunt against President Trump over protecting the safety and wellbeing of their constituents,"" White House spokesman Kush Desai wrote exclusively to Fox News Digital. ""The Trump Administration remains committed to using its full legal authority to confront the distinct national emergencies our country is currently facing—both the scourge of illegal migration and fentanyl flows across our border and the exploding annual U.S. goods trade deficit.""The 12 states, however, argue that the Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to impose taxes and tariffs, and that IEEPA was never intended to authorize trade policy on this scale.

""President Trump’s reckless tariffs have skyrocketed costs for consumers and unleashed economic chaos across the country,"" said Gov. Kathy Hochul. ""New York is standing up to fight back against the largest federal tax hike in American history. Attorney General James and I are partnering on this litigation on behalf of New York consumers, because we can't let President Trump push our country into a recession.""""The president does not have the power to raise taxes on a whim,"" said New York Attorney General Letitia James. ""His tariffs are unlawful and, if not stopped, they will lead to more inflation, unemployment, and economic damage.""
Since February 2025, Trump has signed multiple executive orders imposing new tariffs on Canada, Mexico, China, and nearly all other U.S. trading partners.
The administration cited national emergencies as the basis for the tariffs, including drug trafficking,illegal immigration, and unfair trade practices. The states in the lawsuit claim the president's justifications are vague and legally insufficient.
The IEEPA, enacted in 1977, allows presidents to respond to specific international threats, such as terrorism or hostile foreign actors. But according to the lawsuit, no president in the 48 years since its passage has used it to impose tariffs.

The complaint argues that the new tariffs were imposed without congressional approval or the necessary legal findings to justify sweeping trade actions.The lawsuit also claims that tariffs are not connected to any specific ""unusual and extraordinary"" threat, as required under IEEPA, which the Trump administration cited as its authority. The states claim the tariffs will significantly raise consumer prices, drive inflation, lead to job losses, and create widespread economic instability.

The legal challenge doesn’t justfocus on economics. It argues the tariffs are unconstitutional because they usurp congressional authority over taxes and trade. The lawsuit also claims the administration’s shifting policy — which they claim is often modified by executive orders or social media — has created chaos in trade and financial markets.
Supporters of the Trump administration say the tariffs are a bold move to protect American industries and correct longstanding trade imbalances.
At a February 2025 press conference, President Trump said, ""We took in hundreds of billions of dollars [with past tariffs]… It’s going to make our country rich,"" framing the measures as a continuation of his America First economic agenda.
But the lawsuit paints a different picture of legal overreach and a lack of transparency. It argues that if President Trump's actions are allowed to stand, any future president could impose taxes under the label of emergency authority, bypassing Congress entirely.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-vs-powell-an-ugly-fight-we-dont-need,Trump vs Powell: An ugly fight we don’t need,"OutKick founder Clay Travis and Fox News senior political analyst Juan Williams join 'MediaBuzz' to discuss President Donald Trump's feud with the chair of the Federal Reserve.
PresidentDonald Trumpwants to fire Jerome Powell, chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. No word yet on what Powell thinks about Trump’s job performance, but Powell says he doesn’t intend to quit before the end of his term next year. If Trump does try to fire him, he’ll see Trump in court.
It’s a mess. It’s like being a little kid in abig crazy familywatching the grown-ups have a nasty, screaming fight in front of the neighbors. It’s embarrassing. But it’s more than that. This big crazy family needs the neighbors – which includes everyone in the world who participates in our financial system – more than ever.
There’s probably not much we can do about the fight. The grown-ups clearly don’t care much about us kids – if they did, they’d quit fighting and figure all this out. But it might be helpful to understand what the fight is about and how it could be easily resolved.

Behind all the details there is one huge problem: the grown-ups are bad with money. Real bad. The last several presidents and Congresses, have racked up something like $37 trillion in debt, most of it owed to the people watching in horror as the fight over the Fed gets ugly. As more and more of them conclude this is a badly dysfunctional family – something already on every neighbor’s minds – it’s going to be harder and more expensive to finance all that debt.
TRUMP SLAMS JEROME POWELL AS 'MR. TOO LATE,' CALLS FED CHAIRMAN A 'MAJOR LOSER'
As you would expect, there’s a political part of the fight. Trump thinks Powell has just one job, which is to do whatever Trump tells him to do. But that’s wrong. TheFederal Reserveis created by Congress. Powell is supposed to do what Congress tells him to do. And right there in 12 U.S.C. § 225a Congress has ordered the Fed to promote ""maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""
That seems clear enough until you turn to Section 10, where Congress tells the president he has the duty to appoint the chair of the Fed. Trump claims that this must mean he also has the power to fire the chair.
If this was a simple power struggle, it wouldn’t matter all that much. But Trump alsostarted an economic fightin January when, in his inauguration speech, he promised to ""overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families. Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.""
AMERICA CAN RETURN TO FISCAL SANITY WITH STRONG FEDERAL RESERVE LEADERSHIP AND TRUMP BACK IN THE WHITE HOUSE
So far Trump has been inconsistent in honoring that promise. On April 2 he announced his massive ""liberation day"" tariffs. On April 9, he suspended the tariffs. He said China was a big problem that required the U.S. to imposemassive new tariffs. Then he suspended those tariffs on electronic goods.
You might think that if the president is talking and not doing, things can’t go too badly. Maybe his advisors are keeping him from doing any real harm.
If only.
In fact, the uncertainty is almost worse. Businesses can’t brace themselves for one threat, they must worry about them all.
TRUMP CRANKS UP HEAT ON FED CHAIR WHILE PRESSING FOR RATE CUT: 'POWELL’S TERMINATION CANNOT COME FAST ENOUGH!'
Powell is in an even tougher spot. His mandate –low inflationand low unemployment – are tough enough without a president who thinks he can ""overhaul our trade system."" It’s nearly impossible with a president who keeps changing his mind about how to do it.
This whole thing is especially annoying to economists. We can see the damage already being done when we look at the bad stuff happening in bond and currency markets. And we know there’s an easy solution: put a computer in charge of the Fed.
Seriously. Fire Powell, tell Trump he’s got an early tee time and then program a few simple rules into a computer. Let the machine set interest rates and control the money supply.

For at least the past 40 years,smart economistshave been debating ""rules versus discretion."" The question is whether the work of the Fed – influencing interest rates and so forth – should be done by smart people who adjust to circumstances or well-trained clerks who make sure the rules programmed into a computer are followed. (If you want an example of how this could work, check out something called the ""Taylor Rule."")
Rule-following clerks work OK when the rules programmed into the computers are appropriate to the circumstances. But what about when the current economic circumstances don’t fit the rules? That’s when you want smart people with the discretion to adapt to circumstances.
But what if the people we pick are (a) smart but can’t quite grasp changing circumstances, (b) smart but driven by short-term political concerns or (c) not very smart.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/congress-can-stop-californias-radical-environmental-mandates-hurt-entire-nation,Congress can stop California's radical environmental mandates that hurt the entire nation,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has launched an inspiring effort to regain sanity in our nation’s energy policies. One of his initiatives is particularly important — reversing the Biden administration’s attempt to superchargeCalifornia’s electric-vehicle mandates,which would allow that state to push a radical transformation of our nation’s fleet from gas-powered to electric. Congress has an opportunity for a policy and constitutional win here. The reversal of Biden and California’s undemocratic effort is now on the five-yard line. To score, Congress needs to punch through one more bureaucratic agency.
Over the last several years, California has tried to aggressively export itsprogressive energy ideology,leading to a wide number of short-sighted and unconstitutional policies. Near the top of the list are California’s bureaucratically crafted electric-vehicle mandates, some of which seek to transform the nation’s heavy-duty fleet from diesel-based to electric.
California’s attempt to drive national policy would normally run into both constitutional (interstate commerce clause) and statutory (Clean Air Act) roadblocks. Unfortunately, the Biden Environmental Protection Agency attempted to bless California’s overreach by granting so-called Clean Air Act ""preemption waivers"" tothree electric-vehicle mandatespassed by unelected California bureaucrats.
TRUMP ADMIN TOUTS ENERGY COMEBACK
These waivers give California a Sword of Damocles to hang over the industry. Nebraska has fought back, leading a three-part battle by filing lawsuits against California, the Biden-era mandates and the trucking companies that agreed to eliminate consumer choice in the trucking market.
EPA chief Lee Zeldin is already going after California's energy waivers. It's a good start.(Getty Images)
The good news is that the Trump administration is pushing common-sense energy policies, and Zeldin has taken the first necessary step to repeal the waivers. Under the Congressional Review Act, Congress can repeal EPA’s waivers by passing a resolution of disapproval through simple majorities in the House and Senate plus the president’s signature.
President Donald Trump’s promise to unleash American energy by rescinding radical electric-vehicle mandates — combined with Republican majorities in both houses of Congress — make a legislative repeal a no-brainer. Nebraskans are grateful that our two United States Senators, Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, are helping to lead the charge for energy policy sanity.
Now there’s a roadblock. A nonbinding opinion from the Government Accountability Office judged that the California waivers are not ""rules"" of ""general applicability"" subject to review under the Congressional Review Act. That opinion is wrong.
The California waivers are ""rules"" because they enact forward-looking policy decisions. And the waivers are ""generally applicable"" because they reach well beyond California’s borders. Even if one ignores the obvious nationwide (if not worldwide) implications of mandating electric vehicles in the fifth-largest economy in the world, the California waivers are generally applicable because they allow other states to enact electric-vehicle mandates they otherwise could not.
Under the Clean Air Act, only Congress can set emission standards for new motor vehicles. The sole exception is California, which can seek a waiver from EPA to enforce emission standards more stringent than the federal ones. But once California gets a waiver, any of the other 49 states can ""adopt and enforce"" emission standards ""identical to the California standards for which a waiver has been granted"" without asking EPA for permission.
So far, 18 states have adopted at least one of California’s electric-vehicle mandates. The Biden-era waiver paves the way for a widespread adoption of California’s bans on internal-combustion engines. This is precisely the kind of agency action that falls within the purview of the Congressional Review Act.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Finding that the waivers are subject to the CRA is both a lawful and commonsense exercise of congressional authority. The GAO — headed by an Obama appointee — broke its own precedent in issuing nonbinding ""observations"" on whether the California waivers are subject to the CRA. Never before had the GAO opined on an agency action that an agency already submitted for CRA review.
The GAO itself has said that, once an agency action has been submitted to Congress for CRA review, there are ""no impediments to Congress’s exercise of those powers that could be cured by an opinion from GAO."" Procedural irregularities aside, the GAO’s opinion is substantively flawed. It fails to mention that once California gets a waiver, every other state can adopt emission standards identical to the California standards, giving the waivers nationwide effect.
The California waivers are ""rules"" because they enact forward-looking policy decisions. And the waivers are ""generally applicable"" because they reach well beyond California’s borders.
Accepting the GAO’s novel observations here would effectively give unelected bureaucrats the final say on whether elected lawmakers get to review sweeping regulatory decisions — decisions that impact the national economy, consumer choice and federalism itself. If Congress defers here, it risks outsourcing democratic oversight of major national policy to technical advisors. That would weaken our constitutional protections.
The Republican Party has claimed unified control of the federal government only five times in the past 100 years. Using that control to repeal California’s waivers is both a policy and constitutional win. Elected representatives in Congress, not unelected bureaucrats in Sacramento or a so-called ""independent"" agency like GAO, have the power to regulate the means of interstate commerce.

Deferring to the GAO would be an undemocratic trifecta — it would leave in place rules written by unelected state regulators, approved by unelected federal bureaucrats and shielded from democratic review through unelected, self-declared referees. That’s not how a representative government is supposed to work.
Repealing the waivers would do more than block a radical climate agenda — it would restore a basic principle of American self-government: that laws with national scope must be subject to national debate, national scrutiny, and national consent. Congress has the authority to act, and I urge it to use that authority and repeal these short-sighted waivers.

The Trump administration is expected to meet with South Korean officials in Washington, D.C., this week as the nation looks to strike atariff deal with Trump afterthe country was hit with a 25% reciprocal tariff during Trump's April 2 ""Liberation Day"" announcement.
""We're working on the big 15 economies first, we had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. I believe there have been calls with the EU already. And then we have, South Korea coming in next week. And I believe India is also, talking. That's moving very quickly,"" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said of the negotiations last week.
WHAT THE FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE SCREAMING ABOUT TRUMP'S TARIFFS
Trump put a 90-day pause on reciprocal, customized tariffs he had imposed on dozens of nations on April 9, which was an abrupt change of course after saying there would not be a pause to the tariffs, just negotiations. Simultaneously, the Trump administration upped the ante on its tariff on China to 125%.
Now, the administration, including Trump, is diving into negotiations with foreign nations to strike deals that are beneficial to the U.S. and lower the country's chronic trade deficit.
South Korea confirmed on Sunday that officials would visit Washington, D.C., later this week. South Korean Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok and Trade Minister Ahn Duk-geun are slated to meet specifically with Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, Reuters reported.

Trump signed an executive order last week intended to bolster the U.S. fishing industry and ""restore American seafood competitiveness"" by prioritizing commercial fishing while cutting red tape that handcuffs where fishermen cast their nets.
Trump previewed that an executive action related specifically to Maine's lobster industry will land on his desk this week.
MAINE LOBSTERMEN CATCH BIG COURT VICTORY AGAINST BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S 'EGREGIOUS' REGULATIONS
""I did it last time in Maine and they [the Biden administration] undid it. That's why we have to stay president for a long time,"" Trump said from the Oval Office last week, previewing his next executive action related to fishing will focus on Maine's lobster industry.
Under his first administration, Trump cutObama-era regulationsthat prevented lobsterman from fishing in certain areas, including 5,000 square miles of federally protected waters off the coast of Cape Cod.

(CBS)
Randi Weingarten is ""spitting mad."" The head of theAmerican Federation of Teachersis raging, not because American students just put in the worst performance on the national report card in decades, not because chronic absenteeism and behavioral problems in the wake of COVID-19 school closures are crippling teachers’ ability to bring those grades up, and not because record-breaking numbers of students are below basic proficiency.
Nah, it’s because some government employees might lose their jobs.
For people like Weingarten, bureaucrats are always the No. 1 priority. She’ll talk a good game in op-eds about her concern that Department of Education cuts meanstudents with the fewest resourcesand greatest needs will pay the highest price, (which is perhaps something she should have thought about when AFT was suing Gov. Ron DeSantis to keep school closed in 2020, but I digress). If you check AFT’s current lawsuit, you’ll find thefirst line is about federal workers,not students or teachers.
TEACHER REIGNITES DEBATE OVER PARENTAL RIGHTS AFTER VIOLATING FLORIDA LAW
Many parents learned this lesson during the pandemic. For the first time,they saw that union leadersweren’t just working for their members, but actively against people like them, who simply wanted their kids in the schools they paid for.
Teachers unions were more concerned about lost union jobs at the Department of Education than declining test scores in school.(iStock)
Teachers’ unionsare just one kind of many public employee unions that are literally negotiating against you. When a private union uses collective bargaining, they’re negotiating with a private company that creates a product and profits, from which they argue they should take a bigger share to pay for better benefits.
When public employee unions negotiate, they’re doing it with the government, which creates nothing. All they can do is take your taxpayer money and use it to give public employees benefits and job security many regular workers will never see.
President Donald Trump just signed an executive order banning the kind of collective bargaining private unions do for most public employee unions. In doing so, he’s aligned with none other than Democratic Party hero and President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who famously wrote to a public employee union president in 1937 expressing the danger of such practices used against the employer when ""the employer is the whole people.""
The Trump administration has also ordered public unions to report how much time they spend on union activities on the job, just as it did in his first administration.
President Joe Biden shut down that data collection during his tenure, but the Washington Examiner ""managed to get data from 2019… and according to a report by OPM, government union employees spent a total of 2,606,390 hours that year performing union tasks on government time at a cost of $163,327,235."" As DOGE and a Republican administration audit more agencies, they’ll find more.
That’s right, these unions use the majority of the money they bring in (your money!) to pay for political activism, funding candidates and causes to the tune of hundreds of millions and even billions, and they do it on the clock. Some 90+% of that money goes to the Democratic Party, no matter what rank-and-file union members or taxpayers want.
Just recently, Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst uncovered $3.3 million in taxpayer money, and 87,000 hours spent at one agency alone over just two years that went to thousands of hours of union-related activities instead of the American people.

When 13,000 air traffic controllers went on strike in August 1981, newly elected President Ronald Reagan fired more than 10,000 of them and decertified their union, on the grounds that striking as a public employee union was illegal.
The Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization demanded a 32-hour work week and a $10,000 raise, but their striking members ended up being banned from federal service and striking a blow against public employee unions instead. In the ensuing years, the number of strikes and work stoppages in the country went down significantly.
Just recently, Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst uncovered $3.3 million in taxpayer money, and 87,000 hours spent at one agency alone over just two years that went to thousands of hours of union-related activities instead of the American people.
Today, public employee unions are using your money to launch a raft of lawsuits against the administration, arguing — you guessed it — they can’t get fired. Even probationary employees must stay, apparently, the dictionary definition of ""probationary"" no match for the entitlement of government union leaders. Must be nice!

Reagan’s move ""unsettled those who cynically believed no President would ever uphold that law,"" Alan Greenspan later said, reflecting on the legacy of that fight, and it tamed some of the most aggressive tendencies of organized labor for years to come.
Today’s public employee union leaders cynically believe their priorities should override the priorities of their bosses, the American people. But polling shows the bipartisan agreement on this remains. Seventy percent of Americans want public employee unions out of politics, and the record of this administration shows it won’t shy away from taming them.

Dozens of officers in a small-town New York police department near theCanadian borderhave been fined for allegedly taking part in an unauthorized labor strike during a snowy stretch this winter.
The union described the fines as retaliation and an abuse of power that denied the officers due process.
One of the officers says the allegations aren't true. He went to work, participated in on-duty training and even made a drunken driving stop during a span when it snowed ""every day.""
""They're upset that we didn't make them enough money and meet their perceived ticket quota,"" said Andy Thompson, aTonawanda Policeofficer and the president of the department's union, the Tonawanda Police Club.

Tonawanda Police Chief James Stauffiger, whom the union is asking town residents to oust, said Thompson's allegations are ""without merit.""
""I stand behind the charges filedagainst the unionwith the Public Employees Relations Board and the individual officers,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""The process needs to unfold fairly and thoroughly.""
Thompson is among the nearly 50 officers accused of going on strike without authorization for one hour a day over a nine-day stretch and has had two hours of pay docked for each of those days, according to a letter he received that was signed by Tonawanda Town Supervisor Joe Emminger.
BLUE CITY POLICE SERGEANTS SAY THEY'RE PAID LESS THAN SUBORDINATES AS BILLIONS GO TO MIGRANTS
""We didn't strike. We showed up to work every day. We did our jobs every day,"" Thompson told Fox News Digital. ""We didn't write enough tickets, and we didn't put enough money in the town's coffers. And they decided they're going to fine each officer.""
Ticket quotas are illegal under New York law, he noted, and workplace retaliation can be, too.
Between late January into February, the town got so much snowfall it ran out of road salt, and there was an increase in police calls. Officers were also required to spend 16 hours doing mandatory training with new department-issued guns, all during a staffing shortage after seven officers retired or left at the start of the new year, Thompson told Fox News Digital.

OBAMA-ERA PROSECUTOR'S PROBE INTO BLUE STATE POLICE RACIAL BIAS CLAIMS CALLED ‘UNTENABLE’ FOR TROOPERS
This year, Tonawanda Police has issued 123 tickets, according to a filingwith New York'sPublic Employment Relations Board. Between 2021 and 2024, the department issued between 439 and 653 over the same period. Town leaders alleged in the document that the decrease is the result of officers striking without permission in violation of the state's civil service laws.
""It's unheard of,"" said Mike O'Meara, the president of the Police Conference of New York, the state's largest police union. ""They're making this up as they go along.""
He called the town's labor complaint against Tonawanda officers ""unprecedented,"" as well as the fines, which are double the hourly wage of officers for each hour they were allegedly striking.
""It may be somewhat unprecedented to claim that a reduction in the issuance of traffic tickets constitutes a strike,"" said Jerry Cutler, author of ""Legal Guide to Human Resources"" and a Columbia University lecturer. ""However, the critical issue from a legal standpoint is whether the employees have abstained from performing their duties in the normal manner.""
Andy Thompson is the president of the local police union, the Tonawanda Police Club, and was accused of taking part in an unauthorized strike.(Andy Thompson)
Experts say that, feud aside, it boils down to whoever has more convincing evidence.
""A reduction in ticket volume may point to a concerted effort to interfere with the employer’s operations, in which case the action would likely be found to constitute an unlawful strike,"" Cutler told Fox News Digital. ""Alternatively, the evidence may suggest some legitimate reason for the reduced ticket volume – or that this is not an apt means of comparison – which would lead to a finding that the law has not been violated.""
Department leaders say officers went on strike to protest disciplinary measures taken against Tonawanda Officer Bikramjit Singh, aU.S. Armyveteran accused of mishandling evidence while investigating a potential drug deal.
""He had his body camera on. He opens this water bottle. There's a bag in there,"" Thompson said. ""He looks at the bag. … He says it's garbage. He wraps it up in his glove, and he disposes of it.""
However, asuspected drug dealerand suspected drug user later told police there were drugs in the bag, and department officials moved to have Singh fired for throwing it out, Thompson said. The alleged drugs were never recovered, but Singh wound up resigning since being fired could have cost him his law enforcement certifications, Thompson said.

Tensions were already simmering between the rank-and-file and Stauffiger, an Emminger appointee who they accuse of unfairly forcing Singh out and withholding paperwork that would allow him to find new employment in law enforcement in another department.
Stauffiger, a 30-year member of the department, was appointed chief five years ago as part of an effort to eradicate corruption from the department. Thompson, too, represents new leadership, having been president of the union for just over a year.
""There's no due process, and this whole thing was done between the supervisor and the law firm that represents the town, who also donates large amounts of money to the town supervisors' campaign and the Town of TonawandaDemocratic Party's campaigns,"" Thompson said, citing public records. ""So, it's more of a witch hunt than anything.""
Emminger did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did the town's law firm.
Thompson believes the allegations mark the first time the state's civil service law has been used to punish police officers for failing to meet ""quotas"" after he says the town lost money due to a decrease in traffic citations issued during the snowfall.
""This is going to end up being case law by the time this is all over,"" Thompson said. ""This has never been done to a police union before.""

The union has launched a public campaign urging residents to demand that local leaders remove Stauffiger, who they accuse of retaliation and harassment and withholding ""basic gear,"" including winter coats.
According to the union, during the time officers were allegedly on strike, the department still made sevendrunken driving arrests, issued more than 300 tickets and responded to nearly 2,000 more calls for service than the same period a year earlier with 14 fewer officers.

You can say a lot of things about PresidentDonald Trump, but one thing no one can deny: The man understandsshowmanship. And if there’s one place on Earth where showmanship reigns supreme, it’s Las Vegas.
But Donald Trump didn’t build a hotel in Vegas to learn how to count cards or win at slots. He’s built many hotels. What he picked up in Las Vegas was the magician’s most powerful tool: misdirection. The ability to distract the crowd with one hand while pulling off the real magic with the other.
And right now? He’s using that same strategy toget things done for America– whether you love him or loathe him. And those who loathe him have a hard time separating the man from his policies. In just a short matter of time we will uncover whether President Trump is a mad genius or if he’s just mad.

Let me break it down. Misdirection is the art of drawing your opponent’s attention one way, while the real play is happening elsewhere. It’s how a magician pulls a rabbit out of a hat. It's how Trump has always played politics – and he's back on center stage.
10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER
Here are three ways Trump is using magician misdirection right now:
1. Tariff Hype, But The Real Tariffs Were Aimed At China
Everyone’s shouting about Trump’s 10% tariff on all countries – calling it reckless, inflationary and a new trade war in disguise. But while the mainstream media fixates on the headlines, Trump’s real play is something else entirely: Sending awarning message to Chinaand reviving good old American manufacturing.
Consider Trump's tactics. Announce a policy. Change a policy. Announce a policy. Change a policy.
Part of being a master negotiator is to never let your opponent get balanced footing. In the end of this massive flurry of tariff talks the last two weeks, the real tariff hit China the hardest at 145%, sending the ultimate message that we won’t tolerate manipulative tactics from China.
HERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT
While behind closed doors, the Trump team is simultaneously working with economic advisors to roll out a broader industrial plan – one focused on bringing critical supply chains home, incentivizing American-made goods and loosening our dangerous reliance on China. The tariff talk? That’s just the spark. The fire iseconomic independence.
2. Tariff Revenue, Tax Talks
Amid all the tariff scuttlebutt, most Americans are forgetting that right around the corner looms one of thelargest tax discussionsin American history. President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, and those very tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2025.
One of the big initial questions is, how we are going to pay for the tax cuts to continue and for what was promised on the campaign, including no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security benefits.
According to a study, President Trump’s tariff plan (as of April 8, 2025) is projected to raise significant revenue – over $5.2 trillion over 10 years on a ""strict conventional"" basis and $4.2 trillion on a ""partially dynamic"" basis commonly used with tariffs. This revenue could be used to reduce federal debt, thereby encouraging private investment.
HOW THE SENATE AND HOUSE FIND $2 TRILLION
Instead, while most of the public-facing discussion in the media has been abouttrade imbalancesor resurrecting fairness of trade around the world so the United States doesn’t get taken advantage of anymore, this is a master magician move by President Trump as I predict he will use these tariffs revenues as a bargaining chip for a new tax plan that will move corporate tax rates to 15%, fulfill part of the ""no tax"" promises made on the campaign trail, and create tax cuts for millions of middle-class families in America. It’s just that nobody is talking about it right now.
3. It’s Not A Nobel Prize, It’s The Noble Cause
From Ukraine toGaza, and with growing tensions between Taiwan and China, global instability is on the rise. Some suggest that Trump’s goal in stopping these wars is selfishly to win a Nobel Peace Prize.
But while President Joe Biden tried to walk a tightrope, hoping to please both progressives and defense hawks, Trump is pushing a simple message: peace through energy, economic strength, and keeping our enemies off balance. If you don’t comply, ""there will be hell to pay.""
We don’t always know what President Trump’s real goal is in this magic trick. Take over Greenland? Canada as the 51st state? Gulf of America? Mineral deals withUkraine?

If you don’t watch the sleight of hand, what he’s calling for is a return to full-scale American energy dominance – through oil, gas, nuclear and even clean coal – to take power back from rogue nations like Iran and Russia.
While critics scream ""isolationism,"" Trump may just be pulling off the ultimate trick by crafting a platform of controlled strength that aims to keep America out of wars by making sure no one wants to pick a fight in the first place. How would that be for a grand finale?
Atlantic City and Las Vegas may have taught Donald Trump that if you want to win the game, you don’t just play your hand – you control where everyone’s looking. And while the media, the left and even some conservatives keep falling for the noise, he’s laying track for a political comeback that’s part Houdini, part heavyweight prizefighter.

Love him or hate him, Trump knows how to put on a show. But don’t mistake the sizzle for the steak. Look past the lights – and you’ll see the real trick: getting stuff done for America while everyone else is watching the shiny objects.
Because in politics,just like in Vegas, the brilliant magicians don’t succeed with luck. They do it with misdirection.

And this year, Congressional Republicans converted tax season to ""sales"" season. Republicans andPresident Donald Trumpare pushing to approve a bill to reauthorize his 2017 tax cut package. Otherwise, those taxes expire later this year.

""We are trying to avoid tax increases on the most vulnerable populations in our country,"" said Rep. Beth Van Duyne, R-Texas, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee which determines tax policy. ""I am trying to avoid a recession.""
If Congress stumbles, the non-partisan Tax Foundation estimates that a married couple with two children – earning $165,000 a year – is slapped with an extra $2,400 in taxes. A single parent with no kids making $75,000 annually could see a $1,700 upcharge on their tax bill. A single parent with two children bringing home $52,000 a year gets slapped with an additional $1,400 in taxes a year.
""Pretty significant. That's an extramortgage paymentor extra rent payment,"" said Daniel Bunn of the non-partisan Tax Foundation. ""People have been kind of used to living with the policies that are currently in law for almost eight years now. And the shift back to the policy that was prior to the 2017 tax cuts would be a dramatic tax increase for many.""
But technically, Republicans aren’t cutting taxes.
""As simple as I can make this bill. It is about keeping tax rates the same,"" said Sen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, on Fox.
Congress had to write the 2017 tax reduction bill in a way so that the reductions would expire this year. That was for accounting purposes. Congress didn’t have to count the tax cuts against the deficit thanks to some tricky number-crunching mechanisms – so long as they expired within a multi-year window. But the consequence was that taxes could climb if lawmakers failed to renew the old reductions.
""It sunsets and so you just automatically go back to the tax levels prior to 2017,"" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.
A recent Fox News poll found that 45% of those surveyed – and 44% of independents believe the rich don’t pay enough taxes.
Democrats hope to turn outrage about the perceived tax disparity against Trump.
""He wants his billionaire buddies to get an even bigger tax break. Is that disgraceful?"" asked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., at a rally in New York.
""Disgrace!"" shouted someone in the crowd.

Some Republicans are now exploring raising rates on the wealthy or corporations. There’s been chatter onCapitol Hilland in the administration about exploring an additional set of tax brackets.
""I don't believe the president has made a determination on whether he supports it or not,"" saidWhite Housespokeswoman Karoline Leavitt.
""We’re going to see where the President is"" on this, said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent while traveling in Argentina. ""Everything is on the table.""
A Treasury spokesperson then clarified Bessent’s remarks.
""What’s off the table is a $4.4 trillion tax increase on the American people,"" said the spokesperson. ""Additionally, corporate tax cuts will set off a manufacturing boom and rapidly grow the U.S. economy again.""
Top Congressional GOP leaders dismissed the idea.
""I’m not a big fan of doing that,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson on Fox. ""I mean we're the Republican party and we're for tax reduction for everyone.""

""I don’t support that initiative,"" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., on FOX Business, before adding ""everything’s on the table.""

The president has expanded the GOP base. Republicans are no longer the party of the ""wealthy."" Manual laborers, shop and storekeepers and small business persons now comprise Trump’s GOP. So maintaining these tax cuts helps with that working-class core. Raising taxes on the wealthy would help Republicans pay for the tax cuts and reduce the hit on the deficit. And it would shield Republicans from the Democrats’ argument that the tax cuts are for the rich.
Congress is now in the middle of a two-week recess for Passover and Easter. GOP lawmakers and staff are working behind the scenes to actually write the bill. No one knows exactly what will be in the bill. Trump promised no taxes on tips for food service workers. There is also talk of no taxes on overtime.

Republicans from high-tax states like New York and Pennsylvania want to see a reduction of ""SALT."" That’s where taxpayers can write off ""state and local taxes."" This provision is crucial to secure the support of Republicans like Reps. Nicole Malliotakis, R-N.Y., and Mike Lawler, R-N.Y. But including the SALT reduction also increases the deficit.
So what will the bill look like?
""Minor adjustments within that are naturally on the table,"" said Rounds. ""The key though, [is] 218 in the House and 51 in the Senate.""
In other words, it’s about the math. Republicans need to develop the right legislative brew which commands just the right amount of votes in both chambers to pass. That could mean including certain provisions – or dumping others. It’s challenging. Especially with the slim House majority.

""There were trade-offs and offsets within that bill that many people are dissatisfied with,"" said Bunn of the 2017 bill. ""And it's not clear how the package is going to come together with those various trade-offs.""
Johnson wants the bill complete by Memorial Day. Republicans know this enterprise can’t drag on too late into the year. Taxpayers would see a tax increase – even if it’s temporary – if working out the bill stretches into the fall when the IRS begins to prepare for the next tax season.
It’s also thought that finishing this sooner rather than later would provide some stability to the volatile stock markets. Establishing tax policy for next year would calm anxieties about the nation’s economic outlook.
""The big, beautiful bill,"" Trump calls it, adding he wants the legislation done ""soon.""

A month before the 2024 election,Elon Musk tweeted, ""Trump now leading Kamala by 3% in betting markets. More accurate than polls, as actual money is on the line.""
These markets were correct. Also correct is Musk’s assessment of these markets. When people stake their own money, they do so with as much solid information and rational foresight as possible.
This fact is a big reason why PresidentDonald Trumpshould reverse his tariff policy. Financial markets are driven by people investing their own money in anticipation of future economic conditions, and these markets are screaming that the president’s tariffs will inflict enormous harm on America’s economy.

From the time of Trump’s April 2 release of his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs until his April 9 announcement of a 90-day pause in most of these duties, the Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 11% of its value. The S&P 500 dropped by 12% and the NASDAQ by 13%. These massive declines occurred in a mere six days. Then when investors learned of his tariff pause, the sell-off stopped. Much, though not all, of these losses were recovered.
10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER
If the tariffs were truly likely to restructureAmerica’s economyin a way that, as Trump promises, will ""make us very rich and very strong,"" the tariff announcement would have immediately had Wall Street overrun with bulls. They would have ignored any short-term economic disruptions caused by the tariffs. Focused on the bright future, the bulls would have immediately driven share prices upward.
But instead, financial markets tanked as they were mauled by bears – revealing that people in the know and spending their own money anticipated that the economic damage from these tariffs won’t be temporary. It will be lasting.
Then the bulls appeared in force as soon as the president announced his 90-day pause. There’s no better evidence that investors with their eyes on the future are convinced that these tariffs are economically destructive.
And why wouldn’t they be destructive?
RIGHT STARTS TO SOUND LIKE THE LEFT ON TARIFFS: THAT'S NOT AMERICA FIRST
By raising the prices of consumer goods, tariffs shrink families’ purchasing power.
By protecting producers from competition,businesses becomeless entrepreneurial and innovative. The economy’s dynamism diminishes.
Further, because more than 61% of U.S. imports are raw materials and intermediate goods used as inputs by producers in America, tariffs jack up American firms’ costs of production. Covering these higher costs by raising the prices of their outputs, these firms not only sell less at home, their exports become less competitive globally. As firms sell and export less, they lay off workers.
And several foreign governments retaliate by raising their own tariffs. This retaliation further reduces the market for U.S. exports.
Unfortunately, the tariffs’ economic carnage doesn’t end there. By dampening the American economy’s competitiveness and dynamism, tariffs incite global investors to retreat from the U.S.
I OWN A CORVETTE DEALERSHIP AND I’VE ALREADY SEEN THE BENEFIT OF TRUMP’S TARIFFS
Global investment brings capital to our shores and lowers our interest rates. Much of this capital funds the opening of new businesses, the expansion and improvement of existing businesses, and research and development as well as worker training.
These investments raise U.S. GDP. More importantly, they increase American workers’ productivity. And increased worker productivity is utterly necessary if real wages are to rise and Americans’ living standards to continue to improve.
And so as the tariffs prod global investors to flee the U.S., American workers will, over time, find themselves less well-trained, and employed in workplaces that are less productive. Americans’ incomes will shrink.
This retreat of global investors from America will, ironically, achieve one of Trump’s main goals: smallerU.S. trade deficits. The president believes that these deficits are evidence that other countries are cheating America and ripping us off.
NETWORKS GO FULL NEGATIVE SPIN OVER TARIFF TURBULENCE, STEER CLEAR OF GOOD ECONOMIC NEWS
But the president is mistaken. America runs trade deficits because foreigners are especially eager to invest in America. Just as you can’t spend all of your dollars onconsumption goodsif you want to invest, foreigners can’t spend all of their dollars on American exports if they want to invest in America.
Dollars that foreigners don’t spend on American exports raise U.S. trade deficits. But those same dollars are invested in America, causing the U.S. to run capital-accountsurpluses– meaning, a net inflow of investment to our shores.
Because no one invests in places believed to be in economic decline, the now half-century-long run of U.S. trade deficits proves that investors worldwide have immense confidence in America’s economy. We shouldn’t be pestered by having built a globally attractive economy. We should be proud.

And just as a company grows by attracting more investment, so does America’s economy grow by attracting more investment.
Far from U.S. trade deficits signaling Americans being ripped off, theseinvestment inflowsare foreigners’ contributions to the health and growth of America’s economy. The president’s tariffs, alas, will impel foreigners to make their contributions elsewhere.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) pointed out that only half of its D.C. headquarters is being used after the agency's building was added to a list of federal properties marked for sale by the Trump administration Thursday.
HUD's headquarters became the first major federal agency building to be added to the General Services Administration's list of ""assets identified for accelerated disposition"" amid GOP efforts to slim down the government'sreal estate portfolioand potentially relocate agency headquarters outside the nation's capital.
Simultaneously, Democrats have taken steps to block these efforts, including through the introduction of legislation in Congress.
Last month, the GSA retracted a list of 440 ""non-core"" assets, including the HUD headquarters and more than a dozen other federal buildings it had initially listed for sale or disposal, according to the Federal News Network. The GSA subsequently posted a new list, but HUD is the first major executive agency headquarters to be included.

PresidentDonald Trumpcampaigned on relocating federal agencies outside the nation's capital in 2024 as part of his wider efforts to clean up waste, slim down the federal government and ""dismantle the deep state.""
Earlier this week, Trump signed an executive order rescinding two prior executive actions put into effect under the Carter and Clinton administrations, which the president said in his directive ""prevented agencies from relocating to lower-cost facilities."" Trump's directive also points out that by moving federal agencies closer to the people they are serving, rather than being centrally located in the nation's capital, it will help the departments more successfully carry out their missions.
""HUD’s focus is on creating a workplace that reflects the values of efficiency, accountability and purpose,""HUD Secretary Scott Turnersaid Thursday. ""We’re committed to rightsizing government operations and ensuring our facilities support a culture of optimal performance and exceptional service as we collaborate with our partners at GSA to deliver results for the American people.""

The plan is intended to mitigate the cost of Trump's ambitious 2024 campaign promise to cut taxes on overtime pay, tipped wages and retirees' Social Security.
The sources stressed the discussions were only preliminary, and the plan is one of many being discussed as congressional Republicans work on advancing Trump's ""big, beautiful bill.""

Pence has often criticized Trump's policies during his second term,most recently critiquingTrump's tariff uncertainty, arguing even 10% tariffs would drive inflation higher and hurt American families. In a call for limited government, Pence also advocated for Congress to reclaim their authority over tariffsduring remarks this week.
Trump's former vice president refused to endorse him in 2024. Pence, who himself launched a short-lived 2024 presidential campaign, unexpectedly dropped out of the race for the White House during remarks at the Republican Jewish Coalition's annual event in Las Vegas in October 2023. Trump spoke on the same stage soon after Pence's announcement without acknowledging the news.

However, Trump and Pence were seen shaking hands at former President Jimmy Carter's funeral in December – their first public appearance together in nearly four years. Pence congratulated Trump on winning the 2024 election, despite refusing to endorse him.
Pence has distanced himself from his former boss since the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when Pence defied Trump's wishes by affirming that former PresidentJoe Bidenrightly won the 2020 election. Rioters called for Pence to be hanged, and the former vice president has faced the ire of Trump's most loyal supporters ever since.

The former vice president's campaign failed to gain traction as Trump's lead over the crowded Republican Party widened, and Republican voters proved they had not forgotten Pence's ""disloyalty"" to Trump during the attacks on the U.S. Capitol.
Pence ran on a traditional conservative platform, framing the future of the Republican Party against what he called the rise of ""populism"" in the party. Among the slim anti-Trump base of the Republican Party, Pence received praise for his courage on that day. As Pence campaigned in Iowa and New Hampshire, voters at town halls often thanked Pence for standing up to Trump.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/new-study-about-irs-reveals-just-how-much-trump-tax-cuts-saved-you,New study about IRS reveals just how much Trump tax cuts saved you,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram discusses Republican efforts on Capitol Hill to pass President Donald Trump’s tax policy and more on ‘Special Report.’
In Washington, facts are often the first casualty of politics. Nowhere is that more apparent than in the debate over the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 — President Donald Trump’s signature tax reform law from his first term in office. As debates rage whether to extend the TCJA’s individual tax cuts, left-wing politicians and legacy media outlets are ramping up their usual misinformation campaign.
We’ve all heard the talking points: The TCJA was a ""wealth transfer"" that came ""at the expense of working families,"" a ""giveaway to billionaires,"" or my personal favorite, a ""reverse Robin Hood"" scheme to rob the working class for the benefit of the ultra-wealthy.
There’s just one problem: none of that is true. Not even close.
TAX TIPS: LAST-MINUTE ADVICE FROM EXPERTS AS TAX DAY NEARS
Earlier in April, I co-authored a new policy study for The Heartland Institute examining the latest IRS personal income tax data. Our goal was to determine if the Republican tax law is still saving taxpayers money, and if so, how much?
Trump can point to the success of his tax-cut strategy in aiding the middle class, according to a new study.
What we found is that lower- and middle-income Americans have received the largest tax breaks due to the TCJA — and these are not small amounts, either. We estimate tens of millions of filers have saved thousands of dollars because of the Republicans’ tax reform law, savings that are now at riskshould Congress fail to extendthe cuts before they expire at the end of 2025.
The evidence is clear, compelling and impossible to ignore — unless you’re a partisan activist masquerading as a journalist.
Using government data, we were able to calculatehow much in taxesthe average filer in each IRS income bracket paid annually from 2017 to 2022. TCJA was passed into law in 2017 but didn’t go into effect until 2018. By comparing the data from 2017 to later years, we can determine the effect of the tax cuts on individuals and families.
The IRS data shows that every income bracket received a tax cut because of the TCJA, but the taxpayers who received the biggest cuts, in terms of percentage saved, went to those who earned less than $75,000.
For example, the average filer in the IRS’s ""$40,000 under $50,000"" bracket paid 18.8% less in taxes in 2022 than they did in 2017.
Similarly, the tax bill for filers in the ""$50,000 under $75,000"" bracket was 16.5% less in 2022 than it was in 2017.
For comparison, those earning between $5 million and $10 million paid 2.3% less over the same period. So much for the ""billionaire tax cut"" narrative. (You can find data for other income brackets in our published paper, which is availablehere.)
Some critics of the TCJA have claimed that although middle-income Americans received large cuts to their tax rates, those tax rate reductions didn’t amount to significant savings in terms of total dollars. But these assertions are also false. Many middle-class Americans have saved thousands because of the TCJA.
A new analysis of IRS tax data indicates that everyone benefited from the Trump tax cuts, but those who earned less than $75,000 received a much-higher percentage of savings.(Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
Our analysis found from 2018 to 2022, filers earning between $50,000 and $75,000 annually saved an average of $4,516 because of the personal tax cuts contained in the TCJA. For those in the $75,000 to $100,000 bracket, the savings jumped to $5,923. And those earning $100,000 to $200,000 saved an astonishing $9,638 over five years.
These numbers do not tell the full story, however. Because the most recent IRS data available is from 2022, total savings estimates do not include the numbers from 2023 and 2024. To account for these years, we developed projected figures using the average amounts saved in 2018 to 2022.
After extending the analysis through 2024 using consistent annual trends, the numbers become even more impressive. In 2022, more than 50 million middle-class filers fell into brackets that saved on average between $6,322 and $13,494 in total savings.
Even lower-income and working-class Americans saw substantial relief. We estimate that households making between $30,000 and $50,000 saved $2,537 to $3,833 over the same period.
Ironically, the very law Democrats call a boon for the rich has made the U.S. tax code more progressive. We came to this conclusion by examining the tax burden paid by each IRS income bracket in 2017, the year before TCJA went into effect, compared to their burdens in subsequent years.
What we found is that in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available, every income bracket earning less than $200,000 paid a smaller share of the total personal income tax burden than they did in 2017. Conversely, every bracket above $200,000 paid a greater share.

That means that although every income group received a tax cut because of the TCJA,the Trump tax cutscaused wealthier filers to pay for a bigger chunk of the personal tax revenue pie than they did in previous years, the exact opposite of what Democrats frequently claim.
If Congress does nothing, the TCJA’s personal income tax cuts will expire at the end of 2025. That means tens of millions of Americans will face a stealth tax hike. For many middle-income families, it could mean paying $900 or more in taxes annually.
After extending the analysis through 2024 using consistent annual trends, the numbers become even more impressive.
Washington elites might not feel it, but working families sure will.

That’s why this fight matters. This isn’t about President Donald Trump or partisan point-scoring — it’s about whether the government should take more from families already struggling under the weight of inflation and stagnant wages.
The data is in. The verdict is clear. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act worked — for everyone, but especially for working-class and middle-income Americans. It’s time to tell the truth about the tax cuts, and then make them permanent.

Roughly 2,300 HUD employees have taken the deferred resignation offers, with slight fluctuations possible as they iron out final agreements with staffers, Fox Digital learned. Ahead of theTrump administration, HUD employed nearly 10,000 individuals.

""Thanks to this political irresponsibility,"" the board said, the U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio has declined only slightly since the COVID-19 pandemic—with this small recovery occurring because economic growth and inflation boosted the ""nominal"" GDP value.
It added the Biden administration had made things worse.
""Like the World War II debt, most of this was incurred because the government was responding to an extraordinary emergency and borrowing as needed to fund many stimulus measures,"" the Post wrote. ""After the emergency ended, though, policymakers made no effort to pare the debt load.

The debt has continued to grow, from $21.7 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $28.9 trillion in early 2025.

James, who is a longtime political foe of Trump's, is only in the preliminary stages of investigating whether Trump or people close to him may have had advance knowledge of a tariff decision that caused stock markets to surge.

James, a former city council member in New York and public defender, launched her run for New York attorney general during the 2018 cycle, while emphasizing that if she were elected, she would aggressively pursue legal charges against Trump, vowing toexpose the ""con man"" followingher win that year.
James reported in November 2024 that her office took on nearly 100 legal challenges against Trump during his first administration and added after his second presidential win last year that she would continue challenging him in the courts to ""defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law.""

""We faced this challenge before, and we used the rule of law to fight back. And we are prepared to fight back once again because, as the attorney general of this great state, it is my job to protect and defend the rights of New Yorkers and the rule of law.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-administration-refers-ny-ag-letitia-james-possible-prosecution-allegations-mortgage-fraud,Trump administration refers NY AG Letitia James for possible prosecution over allegations of mortgage fraud,"Fox News contributor Jonathan Turley discusses mortgage fraud allegations against New York Attorney General Letitia James in court documents obtained by 'The Ingraham Angle.'
New YorkAttorney General Letitia James has been hit with shocking allegations by the Trump administration, accusing her of mortgage fraud.
In documents obtained by Fox News Channel's""The Ingraham Angle,""the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sent a criminal referral to the Department of Justice on Tuesday, accusing James of mortgage fraud.
FHFA Director William Pulte said in a letter to Attorney GeneralPam Bondithat James appears to have falsified records to meet certain lending requirements and receive favorable loan terms.
Pulte cited a property in Virginia that James allegedly claimed as her principal residence and a property in New York she claimed as a four-unit structure instead of five, which he said could mean she was able to get a different and more favorable loan.
In response, a spokesperson for James' office said Wednesday morning that she has been ""focused every single day on protecting New Yorkers, especially as this administration weaponizes the federal government against the rule of law and the Constitution. She will not be intimidated by bullies — no matter who they are.""

Fox News contributor and George Washington University law professorJonathan Turleytold Fox News host Laura Ingraham the irony of James getting accused of falsifying records is ""perfectly crushing.""
""This is a person who prosecuted Trump for everything short of ripping a label off a mattress, and among the charges that were brought in New York, in not just the civil but the criminal case, was making false or misleading statements to financial institutions,"" Turley said. ""As for James, if we apply the Letitia James standard that she created, there'd be little question here. This seems pretty straightforward.""
He explained the Trump administration is saying this was not her principal residence because, as a New York elected official, she has to say her principal residence is in New York.

James is also accused of saying her father was her husband to file as a married couple, Turley added.
""The Supreme Court just stated earlier in March, in a case called Thompson, that they want to see knowing false statements under sections, like 10-14, not just misleading statements,"" Turley said. ""These are misleading statements. Either it's your principal residence or it's not. Either you're married to your father or he's your father.""
The DOJ did not respond to Fox News on the matter.
The issue has been prosecuted in the past, but as Turley said on ""The Ingraham Angle,"" the ""documents themselves are quite damning.""

""In which case, AG James appears to have engaged in the very sort of fraud which she alleged in her ludicrous case against Donald Trump. Let's see now, if indeed, as AG James has stated herself, nobody is above the law.""
The New York Post reported that the documents show that the property James purchased with her father had both parties listed as ""husband and wife"" in 1983 and 2000.
""While this was a long time ago, it raises serious concerns about the validity of Ms. James' representations on mortgage applications,"" Pulte reportedly wrote.

James brought forth a civil fraud suit against PresidentDonald Trump,the Trump Organization and its senior leadership in 2022, frequently sitting in the courtroom throughout the proceedings and celebrating the prosecution of Trump in the Manhattan criminal trial over the 34 counts of falsifying business records.
Trump was ordered to pay a $454 million civil fraud judgment in James’ lawsuit against him, which is currently on appeal.
So far in 2025, James has spearheadedat least five legal actions againstthe Trump administration, including leading a coalition of state attorneys general to sue the federal government to halt DOGE’s access to the Treasury Department’s internal systems, and another lawsuit related to the Trump administration slashing grant funding to research institutions and universities.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/house-prices-skyrocketed-under-biden-now-guess-who-democrats-want-blame,"House prices skyrocketed under Biden. Now, guess who Democrats want to blame?","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Democrats love blaming high home priceson everything but their own policies.
Over the past five years, the cost of a median house has risen 20% nationally while wages rose just 4% — and that disparity doesn’t even account for increased mortgage rates.
Withhousing costs becoming a massive painpoint for millions of American households, it’s easy to see why Democrats want to avoid taking responsibility (and blame Republicans if possible).
DIY EXPERT SHARES TIPS AND GADGETS FOR SPRING CLEANING
Some, like Nevada Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen, have taken aim at President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. In a recent letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, she warned that Trump’s tariffs on Canadian lumber would ""drastically increase the cost ofconstructing housing in the United States.""
House prices shot up during the Biden years and wages didn't come close to keeping up.(iStock)
Like many economists, I’m no fan of tariffs, but in this case, Rosen’s concern is nothing more than political posturing. For one thing, Biden actually increased tariffs on Canadian lumber and received very little backlash from his own party.
It’s also worth noting that lumber prices alone have a relatively small impact on the cost of home construction (and shouldn’t affect the price of existing homes at all).
One analysis by the National Association of Homebuilders (which advocates for low tariffs on construction materials) found that framing is the single most expensive part of building a new house, accounting for 15.5% of the final construction cost. But when you consider framing as a share of the home’s sales price (which is what buyers actually care about) and try to separate out labor costs, lumber accounts for a much smaller percentage — perhaps as low as 4%. The current tariff on Canadian lumber is 14.5%.
Crunch those numbers, and it seems like wood tariffs drive up the cost of a median home by a few hundred dollars at most. That’s not nothing, but it doesn’t come close to explaining how home prices got so out of control.
Another Democratic line of attack, best exemplified by anexchangebetween JD Vance and podcast host Lulu Garcia-Navarro, has focused on immigration policy.
""So how do you propose to build all the housing necessary that we need in this country by removing all the people who are working in construction?,"" Garcia-Navarro asked the then-candidate for vice president.
""Well, I think it’s a fair question because we know that back in the 1960s, when we had very low levels of illegal immigration, Americans didn’t build houses,"" Vance answered, sarcastically.
It’s true that non-citizens disproportionately work in construction (though not all construction workers build homes), but it’s also true that they compete with citizens for scarce housing. Even the libertarian Cato Institute acknowledges that ""the marginal immigrant increases housing demand more than he increases housing supply."" This means that, on the whole, less illegal immigration and more deportations will mean cheaper housing.
Democrats have tried to blame President Donald Trump for the spike in house prices. But President Joe Biden's administration was responsible. (Photo by TING SHEN/AFP via Getty Images)
Though, of course, the entire issue is a red herring, since the massive wave of illegal immigration under President Joe Biden coincided with a spike in housing costs. Even if it were true that tight border controls and strict immigration enforcement would make homes more expensive, it wouldn’t explain how they got so expensive in the first place.

Perhaps most absurdly, Democrats and the Biden administration even tried to blame landlords’ greed and the pricing algorithms they use. The Biden Justice Department sued one of these algorithms to ""make housing more affordable for millions of people across the country,"" and Democrats in Congress have proposed similar legislation to end the use of this software. This is ridiculous. An empty apartment is a huge financial hit for a landlord. That is exactly what happens when they price their units too high — they are left holding them back.
Fortunately, while Democrats continue to scapegoat and point fingers, Republicans are aiming to fix the housing cost inflation problem with deregulation.
This means that, on the whole, less illegal immigration and more deportations will mean cheaper housing.
For example, under newly confirmed Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner, the Trump administration is working to cut red tape that many builders say has held back new construction.

Turner has announced a comprehensive review of HUD’s programs. Of course, much of the red tape is state or local, but there are plenty of federal barriers that can be deconstructed as well, and that is exactly what the Trump administration plans on doing.That’s a step in the right direction, which is far more than what the Democrats are currently offering. Hopefully, it’s the first of many similar initiatives to come. Housing is a great populist issue that can provide endless political wins for the White House — so the more, the merrier.

Saturday marked 100 days of thenew Republican majorityin the U.S. Senate, and we’ve been keeping our foot on the gas. We’ve spent 13 weeks in session, including the longest continuous period of session in 15 years, and the Senate has taken more votes at this point than in any other Congress since at least the Reagan era.
We have a lot to show for it. We confirmed the president’s Cabinet at the fastest pace in more than 20 years, despite Democratic obstruction, and we are building out the rest of PresidentDonald Trump’s team at a brisk pace. As of this week, the Senate has confirmed more than 50 Trump nominees, including a new FBI director, a new chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and several ambassadors to key postings abroad.
And confirmations are far from the only thing we’ve done. We passed Sen. Katie Britt’s, R-Ala., Laken Riley Act, which ensures that illegal immigrants who steal, assault a law enforcement officer, or kill or seriously injure another person are detained instead of being allowed back out on the street. And we passed Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Bill Cassidy’s, R-La., HALT Fentanyl Act to provide law enforcement with critical tools to combat this deadly drug.

We’ve also been working to repeal burdensome Biden-era regulations. The Senate has so far passed seven Congressional Review Act resolutions to roll back Biden rules. Among other things, we’ve repealed theBiden administration’s tax on natural gas, taken action to protect Americans’ financial freedom, and repealed burdensome mandates on household appliances that got caught up in the Biden administration’s climate agenda.
10 TOUGH TRUMP TARIFF QUESTIONS CRITICS DON'T WANT TO ANSWER
Importantly, we’ve also laid the groundwork for a permanent extension of the2017 tax reliefand a transformational investment in our border, energy and national security. I’m proud of the role the Senate has played in advancing this process, and I’m looking forward to finishing the final bill.
I should also note that the list of our accomplishments would have been even longer if Democrats had not repeatedly filibustered commonsense legislation. Yes, the party that mere months ago was making plans to destroy the filibuster – a key Senate rule that today helps preserve the Founders’ vision of the Senate – is now using it repeatedly.

Democrats have filibustered legislation to keep biological men out of women’s sports, protect babies born alive after botched abortions, and sanction the rogue International Criminal Court, which is targeting Israeli leaders today and has a history of targeting American citizens.
With as much as we’ve already accomplished, there’s a lot more work to be done, and we’ll continue to keep our foot on the gas. There are appropriations bills to consider, more burdensome regulations to repeal, and work to be done to complete the final bill that will deliver on our promises on taxes,border security, strengthening our military, unleashing American energy, and getting our country on a more sustainable fiscal path.

There are also more nominations to consider, and the Senate will continue to keep up a brisk pace. If Democrats decide to obstruct nominees, that isn’t going to mean we slow down; it means we are going to keep senators here longer to get these confirmations done. If that means late nights or weekends, so be it. As I said to my Democrat colleagues, we can do these nominations the easy way or the hard way.  But one way or another we are going to get them done.
It’s been a busy 100 days in theUnited States Senate, and I’m looking forward to delivering more results for the American people as Senate Republicans, House Republicans, and the White House continue to work together to advance our shared agenda.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/time-pull-plug-corporate-virtue-signaling,Time to pull the plug on corporate virtue-signaling,"EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin joins 'America's Newsroom’ to discuss oil giant BP’s decision to lower their spending on green energy initiatives.
Over the past decade, the leaders of corporate and international organizations became used to being lauded for making grand but ultimately empty, green promises on stages in Davos andclimate summits. How quickly things have changed.
Fear of being called out by theTrump administrationis forcing many leaders into changing course – at least in their rhetoric.
World Bank president Ajay Banga’s first move when he took over the institution in 2023 was to extend its mission from ending poverty to incorporate climate change and making the planet ""livable.""
Protesters marched on Saturday in Glasgow, host of the COP26 U.N. climate summit. (Getty Images)
Last November, as he headed to the COP summit in Azerbaijan, Banga graced the cover of Time magazine’s ""climate issue"" and warned thatclimate changewas ""intertwined"" with every challenge. Yet today, he somewhat implausibly tells reporters, ""I’m not a climate evangelist.""
TRUMP IS ENDING BIDEN’S WAR ON ENERGY AND ONE STATE IS KEY TO THAT STRATEGY
The shift in self-identification is frankly meaningless without deeper change. For the development banks, there is much work yet to be done to end poverty. Astonishingly, the World Bank and the African Development Bank ring-fence a whopping 45% and 55% of annual financing, respectively, for climate projects. Both institutions divert half or more of these climate funds to projects that reduce the emissions of poor people – an absurdity when energy poverty remains a huge barrier to development.
It is hypocritical and ultimately immoral to insist that poorer countries rely on intermittent solar and wind when every single rich country has access to a vast amount ofaffordable, dependable energy, mostly from fossil fuels. Indeed, Africa has been forced to finally get its own energy bank to fund fossil fuel projects because the major development banks refuse to invest in them.
It remains to be seen whether the U.S. will use its significant shareholdings in the World Bank and African Development Bank to encourage a return to less glamorous development basics, or whether the Trump administration will be content with just a change in language.
The development banks could take a leaf out of corporate America’s book. Parts of the private sector have moved ruthlessly to abandon green virtue signaling and return to their core work.
AMERICA'S ENERGY FUTURE: BREAKING FREE FROM CHINA'S INFLUENCE
Climate change is undeniably a real problem which has tangible economic impacts. However, climate solutions also come with their own set of costs, oftendemanding that businessesand individuals rely on pricier, less dependable energy sources. The decision to balance the expenses of climate policies with the advantages of climate action falls rightly under the responsibility of governments, not profit-driven businesses.
Yet over the past decade, even major contributors to climate change – such as the fossil fuel industry itself – invested in extraordinary green policies. Five years ago, BP made an astonishing promise to slash its oil and gas production by 40% by 2030, while increasing green energy generation twentyfold and becoming net-zero. Now, along with other big, Western oil companies, it has abandoned those farcical green promises and recommitted to its primary activity: fossil fuels.
No doubt, this U-turn will be lamented by green activists. But the truth is that these promises were always an inefficient way of helping the planet, and very shortsighted for fossil fuel companies. Even after the world has spent $14 trillion on climate policy, more than four-fifths of global energy remains supplied by fossil fuels.

Over the past half-century, fossil fuel energy has more than doubled, with 2023 again setting a new record. Consumers and businesses are crying out formoreenergy, while competitor state-owned oil companies from the Middle East have continued to provide more fossil fuels. It is a foolish energy company that declares it will supply less energy.
Banks also had a flingwith green policies, and have now dumped them, with the six largest U.S. banks leaving the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, and Wells Fargo officially abandoning its goal of achieving net-zero emissions across its financial portfolio by 2050.
While some industries are moving faster than others, there are signs that many companies will just change their language, and not their inefficient climate policies.

A recent global survey of 1,400 corporate executives found that 58% of companies ""are deliberately planning to decrease their level of external communications"" about climate policies, even though most intend to spend even more on these than before. Shareholders need to ask hard questions about what these policies really do for the planet, and what they add to the bottom line.
As leaders of international organizations and corporations scramble to adapt to an entirely new world, it’s important they go further than just shifts in rhetoric. The era of being cheered on forevery green promiseand vow – regardless of how silly or self-defeating – has come to an end. Now it’s time for those leaders to get back to business.

With tax day here, it’s time to revisit a shocking study that revealed some unpleasant math for theAmerican taxpayer.
It added up the total – all in, with real dollars – for how much average Americans pay in taxes over the course of their lifetime.
The result: $524,625, or more than half a million dollars in federal and stateincome taxes, property taxes, sales tax, and taxes on major purchases sent to the government by the time you retire.
For all your hard work, and a lifetime of effort and sacrifice, it adds up to a half million dollars you’ll never get to spend.(iStock)

For all your hard work, all those complicated forms, and a lifetime of effort and sacrifice,it adds up to a half million dollars you’ll never get to spend.
And it gets even worse when you realize what youcouldhave spent it on.
The median price of a home sold last year in the United States was $419,200. If you add that to the average price of a brand-new car ($49,740), your lifetime of taxes could have bought a brand-new house andtwonew cars, with thousands left over.
The average cost of raising a child from birth to age 18 is estimated at $237,500, so your lifetime of taxes could more than cover that… twice. Adding that total could also more than double the average family retirement savings in the U.S. – about $334,000.
And if that money had been invested in the stock market instead, your tax dollars would have nearly tripled in value to about $1.5 million, thanks to compound interest and an annual S&P 500 rate of return (minus inflation) of 6.78%.
TRUMP, TARIFFS, THE CR AND THE TAX CUTS
Now, take a look at how your tax moneyisbeing spent instead.
The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), at the direction ofElon Musk, has exposed and canceled an estimated 7,300 contracts and 9,300 grants from the federal government, with a total estimated savings of about $140 billion todate.
As it happens, some of those grants and contracts are almost exactly equal to your lifetime total of $524,000 – so we can see just what our lifetime of work is worth to Washington, D.C.
DOGE recently canceled a $523,000 grant for ""small-scale avocado farmers in Honduras"" who ""currently struggle to get their avocados to market,"" and another $522,000 grant to small-scale farmers in Ahuachapan, El Salvador to ""increase incomes and promote sustainable agriculture and food security.""
Another grant for $509,000 would have funded online trainings and exchanges in 10 Latin American countries for ""sports-based training programs usingfútbol callejero(street soccer) to strengthen leadership among disadvantaged youth."" An additional $509,000 was earmarked to ""reduce lead exposure from occupational sources"" in India. Not Indiana – India.
TRUMP'S 'LIBERATION DAY' IS NO CAUSE FOR PANIC. HERE ARE 5 REASONS WHY
A terminated contract for $527,000 was intended for ""senior leadership teambuilding, coaching, and travel with Communication Institute International"" for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the food stamp program.
That’s how your lifetime of honest, diligent tax paying is spent – on just one grant for one year of a project you likely don’t support.
Think of your grandfather's swollen knuckles and cracked skin from a lifetime of labor; the crooked back of your grandmother from shouldering the load.
The taxes from their lifetime of calluses are being callously spent in Washington without a second thought.
And these are only a few needles in a gigantic haystack. A grand total of 624 grants and 902 contracts are valued between $400,000 and $600,000 – paid for by your lifetime of hard work and publicly named and shamed thanks toElon Musk and DOGE.

While talking to reporters, Trump alsoreiterated comments he made last weekabout the need to be flexible amid the ongoing tariff negotiations with various countries.

""There will be maybe things coming… I don't want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we're going to get to the position of greatness for our country.""
A notice published by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol on Friday indicated that smartphones, computers and other electronics would be spared from Trump's 145% import tariffs on Chinese goods. However, the electronics will still be subject to semiconductor tariffs and tariffs related to fentanyl, per the administration and the president.

""I told Fareed Zakaria this morning: When you start giving an exemption here and an exemption there on tariffs, it's introducing all kinds of corruption into the system,"" Lawrence Summers, former Clinton and Obama administration economic advisor, said Sunday. ""It's introducing what economists call rent seeking, where it's hugely advantageous for people to be friends of the first family and hugely advantageous for people to hire lobbyists. So, the big boom that's being created with tariffs is in a crony capitalism.""
TRUMP VOWS NOBODY GETTING ‘OFF THE HOOK’ FOR ‘UNFAIR’ TRADE BALANCES, SAYS THERE WAS NO TARIFF ‘EXCEPTION’
""Look, there is no tariff policy. It's just all chaos and corruption,""Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.,added in an interview with ABC News over the weekend. ""These guys are into chaos and into corruption, and this is the reason that it is time for Congress to step up and to say, under the authority that the president is currently using by declaring these national emergencies — no — the law says specifically Congress can just say, 'There's no national emergency across the board here,' and revoke that authority from the president. That will mean we can go back to having actually a real tariff policy. Congress will have its position in place, and then we can negotiate where we need to negotiate, but we got to stop this craziness.""

Meanwhile, in a weekend Truth Social post following criticism from the likes of people like Warren and Summers, the president sought to defend the move to provide some relief to the electronics industry.
""NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook’ for the unfair trade balances, and Non Monetary Tariff Barriers, that other countries have used against us, especially not China which, by far, treats us the worst!"" said Trump.
""There was no tariff ‘exception’ announced on Friday,"" Trump declared in the post, noting that electronics will still be subject to a 20% tariff related to fentanyl. ""They are just moving to a different Tariff ‘bucket.’ The Fake News knows this, but refuses to report it. We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cuomo-lands-key-endorsement-comeback-bid-nyc-mayor-heats-up,Cuomo lands key endorsement as comeback bid for NYC mayor heats up,"Radio show host Dominic Carter joins ‘Fox News Live’ to analyze Andrew Cuomo’s announcement to run for mayor of New York City.
Former New York Gov.Andrew Cuomois showcasing the backing of two powerful labor unions as he runs for mayor of the nation's most populous city.
The former three-term Democratic governor, who resigned amid multiple scandals in 2021, was endorsed on Monday by the labor groups 32BJ SEIU and Hotel and Gaming Trades Council, which represent building service workers and hotel and casino employees.
The endorsements, which are highly coveted in heavily unionizedNew York City,will likely further cement Cuomo's frontrunner status in June's Democratic Party mayoral primary, as he runs to oust embattled Mayor Eric Adams from City Hall.
""The members of @32BJSEIU and @NYHTC are the backbone of NY. They clean our buildings, run our hotels, care for our communities, and keep this city moving. Without a strong middle class, no city can survive – let alone thrive – and right now, we are dangerously close to losing them,"" Cuomo warned in a statement on social media.
CUOMO SHOWCASES EYE-POPPING HAUL IN NYC MAYORAL RACE
And he highlighted that ""I have fought for and alongside the men and women of 32BJ and HTC for years – their faith in me is a tremendous boost for our campaign and I am proud to have their endorsement.""
The two unions, which combined have over 120,000 workers in their ranks, are the latest organized labor groups to back Cuomo.
WHO'S THE FRONT-RUNNER IN NEW YORK CITY'S MAYORAL RACE
Cuomo's March 1 campaign launch, into an already crowded field of contenders, rocked the race. With over two months to go until the June 24 primary, Cuomo is the clear polling and fundraising frontrunner in the race for the Democratic mayoral nomination. And the winner of the Democratic primary will be considered the overwhelming frontrunner in November's mayoral election in solidly blue New York City.
But now that the 2025 mayoral race is Cuomo's to lose, his rivals are zeroing in on the former governor's immense political baggage.

Cuomo has spent the past four years fighting to clear his name after 11 sexual harassment accusations – which he has repeatedly denied – forced his resignation as governor in August 2021. He was also under investigation for his handling of the COVID pandemic amid allegations his administration vastly understated COVID-related deaths at state nursing homes.
The former governor has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.

Adams' poll numbers were sinking even before he was indicted last year on five counts, which accused the mayor of bribery and fraud as part of an alleged ""long-running"" scheme to personally profit from contacts with foreign officials.

The mayor made repeated overtures to now-PresidentDonald Trump, and in February the Justice Department moved to dismiss the corruption charges, so he could seemingly work with the Trump administration on its illegal immigration crackdown.
The top federal prosecutor in New York City resigned rather than comply, and argued that the mayor had agreed to a quid pro quo with the Justice Department.

In a final move, a federal judge earlier this month dismissed the Justice Department case against the mayor, but argued that the Trump administration’s grounds for having the case dropped ""smacks of a bargain"".
A few days later, Adams announced that he would forgo the Democratic primary and run for re-election as an independent.

Democratic strategist James Carville urged Democrats to avoid distractions in a guest essay for The New York Times on Monday and laid out a plan for the party to win back voters with economic messaging.
""This can only be done if we avoid the distractions — whether it’s Mr. Trump’s third-term talk or Democratic infighting on social issues — and instead focus on the economic foundations that matter to Americans most. My fellow Democrats, it’s time we transform our party into a projector for the economic pain of the American people,""Carville wrote.

""Now, Democrats have an opportunity to allow the Republicans to edge closer to collapse as the party in full control of Washington — let’s please not become the story again and get in their way,"" Carville added.

Carville said Democratsneeded to focus on everyday economic concerns like high prices and 401k accounts while honing in on local messaging. Specifically, the Democratic strategist said it wasn't about the stock market.
""Democrats cannot afford to hinge our economic narrative on the rise and fall of a market for the privileged,"" he said.
Carville wrote that it was important for Democrats to understand it wasn't about them, adding, ""This is not about us going on CNN or taking to X to complain about the president.""
He told Democrats to go on podcasts and project local stories about farmers and others who might be directly affected by tariffs.
""If we avoid the distractions to come and stay focused on the economy, Democrats can take back the one issue that has kept Trump on a respirator all this time. Through all the hardships to come, we bring the silver lining. And finally, we can begin again,"" he concluded.

""What I think is — if he sees himself going down, he's going to try to take the whole country with him,"" Carville said of Trump. ""He is not loyal to the United States of America.

Like others who say to give the president's tariffs a chance, Von called the strategy a ""long-term play,"" noting that the goal of bringing jobs back to U.S. soil and producing products currently built offshore will take some time.
Trump toldFox News' Maria Bartiromo last month that the initial phase of his economic strategy would be bumpy for Americans, specifically noting a ""period of transition"" to come as his policies take effect.
His comments came amid concerns from business leaders about instability caused by tariffs imposed on a handful of countries, as well as growing concerns about a potential economic slowdown.

Here are ten tariff questions that aren’t being asked — but should be.
Many call the American effort to obtain either tariff parity or a reduction in the roughly $1 trillion trade deficit and 50 years of consecutive trade deficits a ""trade war.""
But then what do they call the policies of the past half-century by Europe, Asia,Chinaand others to ensure asymmetrical tariffs, pseudo-health and security trade restrictions, and large surpluses?
A trade peace? Trade fairness?
Why do most nations prefer trade surpluses and protective tariffs?
Are Europe, Asia, China and others stupid? Are they suicidal in continuing their trade surpluses and protective or asymmetrical tariffs?
Is the United States uniquely brilliant in maintaining a half-century of cumulative trade deficits?
Do Americans alone discover the advantages of a $1 trillion annualtrade deficitand small or nonexistent tariffs?
Why don’t America’s trading partners prefer deficits like ours — given we supposedly believe they are either advantageous or perhaps irrelevant?
Would our trade partners prefer to have America’s supposed benefits of a $1 trillion trade deficit?
Would the United States then ""suffer"" like they do by running up $200 billion annual surpluses?
What would now be the reaction of the stock market if over the last decade, wages had increased at the rate of stocks — and stocks at the rate of wages?
Is Wall Street’s meltdown a fear of what might happen in the future? Or is it reacting to March’s latest jobs report that there were 93,000 more jobs created than predicted?
Was the Wall Street panic predicated on reports of much lower oil prices?
Did the furor arise over theMarch inflation reportthat the annualized inflation rate dipped to 2.6% per year?
Is Wall Street’s worry thatDonald Trump’simpending tax cuts, more deregulation, greater budget cuts and continued efforts to eliminate budget deficits and reduce national debt will stall economic growth?
If the US were running a $63 billion-plus trade surplus with Canada, refusing to meet its NATO requirements to spend 2% of GDP on defense, and instead spent only 1.37%, would Canada become concerned?
If Mexico were running a $171 billion trade deficit with the U.S., if Americans in Mexico were sending over $60 billion per year out ofMexicoto the US, and if American drug dealers were making $20 billion by selling fentanyl and opioids to Mexico, would Mexico be angry?
Is the current panic over tariffs amplified by Trump’s other policies?
Is the sudden end of 10,000 illegal entries a day bothering Wall Street?
Are the media furious that the Red Sea is suddenly navigable again, the Houthis in Yemen curtailing their attacks?
Is the outrage due to the targeting of approximately $200 billion in budget cuts or plans to shave off $500 billion from the annual budget?
Does the conundrum arise because Trump is sanctioning Iran, unapologetically supporting Israel and seeking an end to theUkraine war?
Should Trump try to match former President Joe Biden’s $7 trillion addition to the national debt?
Should he return to allowing 12 million illegal aliens into the country?
Was the 2021Afghanistanpullout a good model?
Is Wall Street worried that Trump may copy theBiden New Green Deal, his electric vehicle mandates and more green regulations?
Why are 70 countries now wishing to negotiate tariffs with America, either down to zero or reciprocally to the same rate as ours?
Is that a good thing? If so, why did our trade partners not wish to lower their trade barriers far earlier?
Did they suddenly and spontaneously decide they were acting unfairly and, on their own prompt, now want to make amends?
What’s next?
If there soon is a rush of nations to cut a deal with the United States so as not to be left out of theAmerican market, will there follow another hysterical Wall Street spasm — not to sell, but instead to buy stocks at bargain prices?

James Lankford, R-Okla., joins 'Fox News Sunday' to discuss the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on the economy, his push for a bill limiting Chinese land purchase in the U.S. and his new book, 'Turnaround: America's Revival.'
President Donald Trump's13th week in office is expected to include ongoing tariff negotiations revolving around his reciprocal, customized duty tax plan, as well as a visit from El Salvador's president.
On Wednesday, Trump put a 90-day pause on reciprocal, customized tariffs he had imposed on dozens of nations, which was an abrupt change of course after saying there would not be a pause to them, just negotiations. Simultaneously, the Trump administration upped the ante on its tariff on China to 125%.
Now, the administration, including Trump, is diving into negotiations with foreign nations to strike deals that are beneficial to the U.S. and lower the country's chronic trade deficit, according to officials.
An administration official told Fox News Digital last week that Trump will be personally involved in the negotiations, including taking direct phone calls from fellow world leaders. Trump will serve as the ""final decision maker"" of the negotiations, and he is ""very invested"" in securing the best trade deals for the U.S., the admin official said.

On Monday, Trump will meet withEl Salvador President Nayib Bukeleat the White House. Bukele has emerged as a key ally to the administration regarding immigration policies, including by accepting illegal immigrants of anynationality facing deportationin the U.S. and booking them into El Salvador's notorious prison system. Those deported to El Salvador from the U.S. have suspected ties to vicious gangs, such as Tren de Aragua or MS-13.
El Salvador's CECOT prison is known as the nation's most notorious prison. The prison, which can hold 40,000 inmates, was built to house gang members in a country that held one of the highest murder rates in the world before violence dropped in recent history. Prisoners at CECOT are blocked from receiving visitors and can only attend hearings virtually, while the prison itself blocks any cell signal to ensure gang members cannot contact criminals still on the street, various media reports have detailed.
EL SALVADOR TAKES IN HUNDREDS OF VENEZUELAN GANG MEMBERS FROM US, EVEN AS JUDGE MOVES TO BLOCK DEPORTATIONS
""Looking forward to seeing President Bukele, of El Salvador, on Monday! Our Nations are working closely together to eradicate terrorist organizations, and build a future of Prosperity,"" Trump posted to Truth Social on Saturday, confirming the meeting this week.
""President Bukele has graciously accepted into his Nation’s custody some of the most violent alien enemies of the World and, in particular, the United States. These barbarians are now in the sole custody of El Salvador, a proud and sovereign Nation, and their future is up to President B and his Government. They will never threaten or menace our Citizens again!""
The Department of Government Efficiency'sElon Musk, as well as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, both previewed that the ""Trump Gold Card"" would be operational in the coming days. Trump explained earlier this year that the U.S. would offer a $5 million card that grants foreigners the ability to live and work in the U.S., as well as a path to citizenship.
TRUMP VOWS TO REFUND, DEPORT ANY 'UNSAVORY' IMMIGRANTS WHO TRY FOR CITIZENSHIP UNDER POTENTIAL 'GOLD CARD'
""We’re going to be selling a gold card,"" Trump said from the Oval Office back in February. ""You have a green card. This is a gold card. We’re going to be putting a price on that card of about $5 million and that’s going to give you green card privileges, plus it’s going to be a route to citizenship. And wealthy people will be coming into our country by buying this card.""
""[I'm] working with Howard [Lutnick] to get that, the Trump gold card, operational hopefully in the next week or so,"" Musk said during a Cabinet meeting with Trump last week.
""That'll be very exciting,""Trump responded. ""That's a pathway to citizenship into the United States.""

This was based on faulty information, bad strategy and tactics, and a large-scale willingness to forgopersonal freedoms.
GLOBAL SYSTEM TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AMERICA ON TRADE AND DEFENSE. THAT FREE RIDE IS OVER
Many of us who warned about this were met with resistance for quite some time. Eventually, more people came around to the mistakes and promised this would not happen again.
Today, embedded in the discourse around tariffs, we are seeing many of the same behaviors and language. But staggeringly, it is many on the right that are standing on the wrong side of freedom.
There are, no doubt, myriad fiscal issues plaguing the U.S. today.
AN AMBITIOUS TRADE DEAL WITH INDIA IS IN OUR GRASP
TheBiden administrationleft the Trump administration a giant fiscal mess. After Biden propped up growth with massive deficit spending, our U.S. debt/GDP grew to north of 120%. Our deficit/GDP in the 6-7% range is now that of a country at war. Our spending on interest to service our debt exceeds U.S. defense spending, which is a massive warning sign. Biden’s historic inflation remains difficult to combat.
The Trump administration’s options are limited given all the above, current interest rates, massive financing and refinancing of debt that needs to happen this year and other factors.
However, tariffs are unlikely to work as a tactic to solve the above.
TRUMP RISKS IT ALL, TAKES ON THE WORLD WITH TARIFFS AND PUTS AMERICA FIRST
In the panic of ""do something,"" many Trump supporters are sacrificing principles, sounding more like the left then purveyors of conservative values.
Small businesses who bore the brunt of theCOVID mandates, their after-effects and inflation, are now at risk again. Those who have part or all of their supply chain abroad are going to have a hard time surviving if this goes on much longer and they are not exempted from tariffs.
I have heard over and over again on social media that those businesses don’t deserve to exist, basically the same thing that I wrote about in ""The War on Small Business"" after COVID, when the left told small businesses they needed to close for ""the greater good"" as they defined it.
THE TRUTH ABOUT TARIFFS AND THE HISTORY LESSON MANY CRITICS ARE MISSING
That’s not freedom or America first – that’s central planning garbage.
Moreover, most of those spewing rhetoric don’t realize that small businesses that have part of their business abroad is stillAmerica first. Small businesses in the U.S. exploit comparative advantages in the supply chain. The same businesses often have personnel in design, marketing, sales, administration and other functions in the U.S. that create American jobs.
They may sell all over the globe, getting desired products not just to Americans, but to citizens of other countries as well. When those foreign citizens buy the products, they are supporting American jobs and sending their capital to the U.S. Those profits are invested and spent, often in America.

Telling these businesses not to exist in support of ""the greater good"" is communist-type thinking.
Moreover, if millions of thesesmall businessesgo under, not only will those jobs, profits and capital be removed from America, it is likely a foreign company or a massive corporation will pick up the opportunity and benefit.
That is not America first.

We have many issues to solve economically, but most of those have been caused by moving away from freedom and capitalism. Going further in that direction leaves us without principles and will likely make matters worse.
Hopefully, theTrump administrationwill help Main Street thrive, but that needs to be done with incentives, not anti-freedom barriers.

TRUMP'S TARIFF PAUSE THE LATEST EXAMPLE OF HIS PRAGMATISM ON THE POLITICAL STAGE
In the game of bridge, a ""stratified gambit"" is a strategic play where players are grouped at different levels, or ""strata,"" competing against those in their tier yet still part of a larger tournament. It's a layered competition that allows different skill levels to coexist, compete and win in their own way based on the player's strategy.

Today, this is precisely what's happening with the American economy under theTrump administration's strategic use of tariffs. It’s a multi-tiered economic gambit aimed at restoring trade balance, boosting national production and providing the forgotten American businesses and workers with a fighting chance.
And that’s all we ask for: For our own government to give us that fighting chance.
Unlike conventional trade policies, Trump's tariff rollout was meticulously planned and layered, providing American industries vital time to adjust and reshore without facing immediate retaliatory shocks. This strategy signaled a decisive shift away from ""America last"" policies, prioritizing fair trade and bolstering domestic production.

Against the backdrop of dire media predictions, Corvette Warehouse has experienced a remarkable surge in sales and renewed customer confidence. Consumers, driven by both financial and patriotic motivations, began ""buying American again."" The tariffs effectively corrected longstanding trade imbalances, addressing years of outsourcing and currency manipulation that had eroded American industry. We’ve seen our best week in nearly 36 months.
Alongside advocacy for strategic, temporary trade protections, the tariffs serve to rectify market failures and unfair global competition. Coupled with potential interest rate reductions by theFederal Reserve, this strategy aims to stimulate domestic growth and alleviate the national debt. Yes, the Trump administration has ""paused"" the customized reciprocal tariffs, but the message is already coming through loud and clear.
The shift is palpable in the used-car market, with a notable increase in demand for American-made vehicles and trade-ins of foreign brands. This reflects a growing wave of economic patriotism, where consumers actively prioritize American-made goods. This is exactly what we need to bring jobs back home and rebuild American industry.
Now, America needs further fiscal prudence, includingreduced government spendingand enhanced efficiency, to maximize the benefits of the tariff strategy. This is not isolationism but a strategic move toward balanced trade that supports American workers and businesses.

President Trump is giving America the fighting chance we need. He knows – and we know – that given that chance, we will win.

When asked on Sunday if Warren had actually seen evidence of alleged insider trading, she responded: ""Well, there are people who have looked at what happened to purchases and to calls just before he made that announcement that caused the stock market to skyrocket.""
She continued on Sunday that members of Congress should also be subject to a rule barring them from trading individual stocks.
""This is how the stock market works in order to make sure on a consistent basis that nobody's trading on inside information. And, by the way, Jake, the same thing should apply to Congress. And that is, we should have a rule that no one in Congress can… trade in any individual stocks, no senator, no representative. I have had that bill for a long time.

The USA will be bigger and better than ever before!"" and ""THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT."" The president had previously said he would not pause tariffs but was open to negotiating with other nations.
Trump paused only the higher, customized tariffs he placed on nations that historically installedtrade barrierson U.S. goods, with nations across the world instead facing a lower 10% tariff on goods, as the Trump administration and world leaders hash out negotiations for the reciprocal tariffs.

""Saturday Night Live"" took another swipe at President Donald Trump this weekend, drawing a bold comparison between Trump and Jesus in its latest cold open.
""It’s me, your favorite president,Donald Jesus Trump, comparing myself to the Son of God once again,"" said cast member James Austin Johnson, reprising his role as the exaggerated Trump.
The sketch opened with a dramatization of a Bible scene: Jesus flipping tables in a temple over merchants selling goods. But just a few seconds in, Trump hijacks the scene with a monologue, recapping the week’s economic headlines with his usual bravado.
""Many people are calling me the Messiah,"" he says.

He then likens the recent rollercoaster in stock prices to the resurrection: ""It’s true, the stock market did a Jesus. It died, then on the third day it was risen. And then on a fourth day, it died again, possibly never to return. Just like Jesus.""
The sketch pokes fun atTrump’s recent tariff decisions, which made headlines after sending markets tumbling for a time. Earlier this month, the latest round of tariffs went into effect, triggering investor panic.
Days later, the White Houseannounced a 90-day pause on most tariffswhile trade deals were renegotiated, though Trump still imposed an increased tariff on China. The temporary pause gave the stock market a brief boost before it dropped again.

The show didn’t stop there. The sketch also tackled rising inflation, specifically the price of eggs, a nod to both Easter traditions andeconomic concerns.
""We love Easter. We love bunny. We love hunting for eggs, just like everyone’s doing in the grocery store right now. Because they cost a trillion billion dollars,"" he quipped.
He added, ""I thought that was what the whole campaign was about. But I just can’t crack it.""
While the real Trump did address soaring egg prices in last month’s joint address to Congress, blaming President Biden and promising to ""make America affordable again,"" SNL’s version questioned not just his economic policies but also his religious authenticity.

(Credit: AP)
Economic indicators in PresidentDonald Trump’sfirst term presented hard facts for a lot of positive reporting before the COVID pandemic lockdowns, but that’s not what the broadcast networks presented to America.
Thirty-oneDow Jonesrecords were set between January 1, 2017 and January, 26, 2018. Overall, in 2017, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 25%. The networks routinely ignored the records. But when the market went down in that year, they pounced. NBC’s Lester Holt warned ""Is the so-called Trump bump over?""
So, it’s not surprising that in the currenttariff turbulence, the broadcast networks are accentuating the negative. On April 4, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found the economy added a stronger-than-expected 228,000 jobs in March. The ""CBS Evening News"" didn’t report it. ABC’s ""World News Tonight"" gave it 14 seconds. On ""NBC Nightly News,"" anchorman Lester Holt dramatically demonstrated the commitment to negative spin, given the bad day on the stock market.
TRUMP 'OPTIMISTIC' CHINA WILL MAKE TARIFF DEAL, WHITE HOUSE SAYS
""The breathtaking fall stripping $5 trillion in wealth from U.S. markets in just two days. Squeezing personal savings, leaving companies scrambling to adjust. Many signaling they will have to raise consumer prices on their imported products, big and small,"" he warned. ""Not even a surprisingly strong jobs report – 228,000 jobs added in March – was enough to stem today's market slide.""
Behind Holt, a graphic screamed: ""Markets Lose $5 Trillion+ In Trump Tariff Meltdown.""
Nobody thinks a dark day on the stock market isn’t headline news. But theanti-Trump energyis always present. On April 9, when stocks skyrocketed back after President Trump put a 90-day pause on new tariffs (except for China), NBC anchor Tom Llamas reported the good news, but then hit the brakes. ""There are big questions hanging all over this,"" he said.
Business correspondent Christine Romans acknowledged the gains, adding: ""But consumers still facing higher prices on steep tariffs with China and small businesses wondering where things will stand in 90 days."" Llamas then turned to playing up the China angle: ""That new 125% tariff on China is expected to make everything from clothing to electronics to furniture even more expensive here in the U.S. Brian Cheung now on the prices you may be soon paying.""

These same networks constantlydownplayed inflationunder Biden. In November of 2021, Stephanie Ruhle went on ""Sunday Today"" and claimed we could handle higher prices. ""The dirty little secret here….while nobody likes to pay more, on average we have the money to do so. Household savings hit a record high over the pandemic. We didn’t have anywhere to go out and spend….So, we need to put all of this in perspective.""
Today, they are playing up the prospects of inflated prices in the future. Not only that, but they’re also not interested in the actual inflation news in the present.
On April 10, the consumer price index actually declined 0.1 percent, for a year-over-year inflation rate of 2.4 percent. Once again, on the nightly newscasts, it received short shrift. On NBC, Christine Romans gave it eight seconds: ""That bright spot, consumer prices fell in March from the month before, bringing the inflation rate to 2.4 percent."" That’s eight seconds in a doom-and-gloom report that aired for two minutes and 44 seconds.
On CBS, anchor John Dickerson mentioned in passing: ""Falling gasoline prices are helping to bring inflation down. The government reported today that consumer prices fell a tenth of a percent in March."" That was almost nine seconds out of CBS pushing five minutes of tariff anxiety.
ABC skipped it entirely. They found time to report that China was restricting the importation of American movies – bad news for their Disney overlords – but not the current inflation rate.
The ""PBS News Hour"" added insult to injury, preceding 15 words on the inflation statistic with economic mockery from Team Biden: ""On CNN, former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said President Trump took a wrecking ball to the economy."" Yellen claimed ""This is the worst self-inflicted wound that I have ever seen an administration impose.""

PBS reporter John Yang added, ""The consumer price index data was collected before the president's toughest tariffs. But economists warn that higher prices as a result of the tariffs could emerge in a matter of months."" They always display a big ""But.""
When it comes to Trump, on any issue, the broadcast network ""news"" shows seem designed to push a 100-percent negative narrative – or if they manage ten seconds of good news, it’s 95 percent negative. This illustrates how they could be denounced as making ""fake news"" – the facts may be accurate, but the spin makes it look like a Democrat campaign commercial instead of straight-ahead journalism.

TRUMP TRADE REP TAKES BIPARTISAN FIRE OVER TARIFFS AS DEM LAUNCHES BID TO HALT THEM
The public has heard a lot about tariffs from Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
They’ve heard a lot about tariffs from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.
They’ve heard even more about tariffs fromWhite Houseadvisor Peter Navarro.
But until Tuesday morning, there was little said about tariffs from the man in charge of the administration’s trade policy: Jamieson Greer.
All eyes were on two things Tuesday morning — the stock market and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.(AP/Getty Images)
""The president's strategy is already bearing fruit,"" Greer testified. ""Nearly 50 countries have approached me personally to discuss the president's new policy and explore how to achieve reciprocity.""
Democrats were dubious about Greer’s suggestion. Yes, nations may be willing to negotiate. But carving out sophisticated trade agreements with nations just sanctioned by the U.S. takes time.
""You’re telling us you have nearly 50 countries coming to you, approaching you to enter into negotiation, and you think that you can do that overnight?"" asked Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev. ""You're pretty superhuman here, if that's the case.""
TRUMP TRADE CHIEF FACES HOUSE GRILLING ON TARIFFS
Greer tangled with Sen. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H.
""Even if inflation hits Americans' pocketbooks at 10% because of these tariffs, then theTrump administrationis still going to go charging ahead?"" asked Hassan.
""Senator, your hypotheticals are not consistent with the history we have seen with tariffs,"" Greer replied.
Greer got the third degree from members of Congress on both sides of the political aisle.(Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)
""My hypotheticals are based on the fact that a lot of Americans are looking at their 401(k)’s today and wondering how much of a lifestyle change they are going to have to have or whether they're going to be able to retire when they plan to,"" Hassan shot back. ""This has been a haphazard, incompetent effort. And it's showing.""
After rough showings, the markets actually shot up at the opening bell Tuesday before Greer spoke. It didn’t appear that anything Greer told senators resonated positively or negatively on Wall Street. But lawmakers were well attuned to the market fluctuations.
Especially as they started to hear from constituents.
TRUMP SAYS HE'LL 'TAKE A LOOK' AT EXEMPTING SOME LARGER US COMPANIES HIT ESPECIALLY HARD BY TARIFFS
Outside the hearing room, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., offered one of his signature Bayou homilies to characterize the unfolding trade war.
""God created the world. But everything else is madein China,"" said Kennedy.
""But senator, isn’t the bigger issue here the question of the uncertainty in the markets and rattling around?"" I asked Kennedy.
""Well, there's always uncertainty,"" answered Kennedy.
""But this is a different type of uncertainty, though, Senator,"" I countered.
""Is it going to have to have an impact on your capital markets? Well, yes. Duh. And it's not fun. It's very, very painful. Whether this will have a happy ending or a sad ending depends in large part what President Trump does next,"" said Kennedy.
Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., acknowledged the fate of the market lies largely in the hands of President Trump and whatever his administration does next.(Eric Lee/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
And that’s the key to the entire enterprise. It doesn’t matter what Lutnick does. Or Bessent. Or Navarro. And not Greer. For better or worse, this is President Trump’s baby. Only he can move markets. And potentially trade deals. And that’s certainly what unfolded in recent days.
Democrats — and some Republicans — excoriated the president for unilaterally imposing the tariffs. Lawmakers asked the reasoning for imposing the tariffs. And they argued that the tariffs should have been an issue which came to Capitol Hill.
""Where was the consultation with Congress about this? Where is the homework? You know, Greek and Roman letters thrown on a plaque doesn't mean a strategy that you've informed Congress on,"" Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, asked. ""And part of the question is, where's the homework done by the administration to not misconstrue the authority that was given?""
SCHUMER SAYS TRUMP 'FEELING THE HEAT' AFTER RECIPROCAL TARIFF PAUSE
Cantwell may not have received a sufficient answer from the Trump administration on the rationale. But Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., answered the other part of the question about why the Presidentcut Congressout of the loop.
""Let's not pretend that this is anything other than the president exercising the statutory authority Congress has given him for decades,"" said Hawley. ""Because Congress didn't want to do tariffs, they didn't want to do trade, it was too hot. They wanted the president to hold the hot potato. So now you've got a President who's happy to do that.""
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution declares that Congress has the ""Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States.""
""Let's not pretend that this is anything other than the president exercising the statutory authority Congress has given him for decades,"" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said of Trump's imposition of tariffs.(Win McNamee/Getty Images)
The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative says the U.S. is a signatory to more than 14 total trade pacts. Congress has ratified several of those in recent years. That includes the USMCA. That’s a trade pact President Trump pushed – alongside former House SpeakerNancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in 2020 for the U.S., Mexico and Canada. That deal replaced NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, approved by Congress in 1993. Congress also greenlighted ""CAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, in 2005.
So, Congress has engaged in trade somewhat in recent decades. But maybe not as much as it should have.
Greer appeared for a second time on Capitol Hill Wednesday, testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee.
TRUMP PUSHES BACK ON 'REBEL' REPUBLICANS OVER TARIFFS: 'YOU DON'T NEGOTIATE LIKE I NEGOTIATE'
""Any deal that you do, are you going to bring that to Congress for a vote?"" asked Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash.,
""We'll do what the law requires. Some of it's consultation. Some requires a vote. So we'll follow the law,"" replied Greer.
But DelBene pressed Greer on the president using emergency powers on the tariffs. She quoted from the statute.
Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., pressed Greer on the Trump administration's leveraging of executive powers.(Reuters)
""It states, ‘The President, in every possible instance, shall consult with Congress before exercising any powers,’"" said DelBene. ""That didn't happen.""
Greer said he called Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., and the top Democrat on the panel, Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass.
""I argue that we did not have that consultation,"" said DelBene, who sits on the trade subcommittee.

""The president of United States is in charge,"" Greer said.
""And what do you know about those details?"" countered Horsford. ""It looks like your boss just pulled the rug out from under you.""
Horsford later asked if what the President executed was ""market manipulation."" Greer said it wasn’t.
HOUSE DEMOCRAT SAYS HE'D VOTE TO PROTECT TRUMP'S TARIFF PLAN, WORRIES WHITE HOUSE WILL STAND DOWN
So, when the hearing adjourned, yours truly and Nikole Killion of CBS pursued Greer to get more clarity on the president’s new strategy.
""Can you explain why you were caught flat-footed about the change in the trade policy? Were you aware of any of this?"" I asked Greer before he stepped into an anteroom.
We resumed the quest in the hall.
""Were you not told about this?"" I asked.
""Did you know before your testimony?"" added Killion.
""I'll just refer you to my testimony,"" said Greer.
""Your testimony did not reflect what it was implemented during the hearing,"" I followed up.
""I'll just refer you to my testimony,"" Greer repeated.
""But that's inconsistent with the decision of the president,"" I said.
I tried to get a few answers out of Greer after one of his hearings. He remained fairly mum on most of what he was asked.(FOX)
An aide to Greer then intervened.
""I think the ambassador was extremely clear in his testimony about what was going on, and the president could make the choice,"" the aide interjected.
""Explain why you don't think that this was market manipulation. You said it wasn't,"" I followed up.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent denied the president's move to implement a pause on his tariffs was the result of declines in the financial markets, which have been causing great concern for investors.
The comments came afterthe president issued a pauseWednesday for 75 different countries, which, according to the Trump administration, have shown a willingness to negotiate trade deals in good faith with the United States. Simultaneously, the Trump administration increased its tariff rates on Chinese goods to 125%, which came after China imposed tariffs of its own in response to Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff increase last week.
""This was driven by the president's strategy. He and I had a long talk on Saturday and this was his strategy all along,"" Bessent responded when asked if the tariff pause was the result of market declines.

When asked how he would determinewhich companiesmight receive such an exemption, Trump responded, ""Instinctively.""
""You almost can't take a pencil to paper. It's really more of an instinct than anything else,"" Trump added. ""Some companies, through no fault of their own, they happen to be in an industry that is more affected by these things than others. You have to be able to show a little flexibility, and I'm able to do that.

""You have to have flexibility,"" Trump said Wednesday. ""I could say, ‘Here’s a wall, and I'm going to go through that wall. I'm going to go through it, no matter what. Keep going, and you can't go through the wall. Sometimes you have to be able to go under the wall, around the wall or over the wall.""

After the president's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcements, which included a 10% universal tariff on all imported goods and higher ""reciprocal"" tariffs targeting other countries like China andthe European Union,the Trump administration did release a list of carve-outs related to roughly $644 billion in imports, according to a report fromThe Wall Street Journal.
The exemptions include $185 billion in goods from Canada and Mexico, but the countries remain subject to other tariffs, according to the report.

Additionally, the Trump administration has exempted certain industries, such as the pharmaceutical and semiconductor industries, from new tariffs, but the president has signaled that could change. These sectors and others are facing an ongoing probe, called a Section 232 investigation, according toMarket Watch,to assess the need for imposing tariffs.
No matter the outcome of the investigation, it appears Trump has his sights set on placing higher tariffs on the pharmaceutical industry. He told an audience at a dinner hosted by the National Republican Congressional Committee Tuesday night that""a major tariff on pharmaceuticals"" would be announcedvery soon.

Americans' concerns over the economy, and specifically inflation and tariffs, appear to be partially fueling the downward trend of PresidentDonald Trump'sapproval ratings in a new national poll.
Trump stands at 41% approval and 53% disapproval in a Quinnipiac University survey conducted April 3-7 and released on Wednesday.
The president stood at 46%-43% approval/disapproval in a Quinnipiac poll conducted during his first week back inthe White House, in late January. And Trump was slightly underwater at 45%-49% in mid-February. But the president's approval ratings are basically unchanged from Quinnipiac's previous survey, which was in the field early last month.

Most, but not all, of the most recent national public opinion surveys indicate Trump's approval ratings in negative territory, which is a slide from the president'spoll positionwhen he started his second tour of duty in the White House.
According to the newQuinnipiac poll, Trump stands at 40% approval and 55% disapproval on his handling of the economy. And asked how the president is dealing with the issue of trade, only 39% of respondents said they approved, while 55% gave Trump a thumbs down.
WHERE TRUMP STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS NATIONAL POLL
In the wake of Trump's blockbuster announcement last week to impose tariffs on dozens of countries across the globe, nearly three-quarters thought the tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy in the short term, while just over half said the move by the president would also hurt the nation's economy in the long term as well.

""A large majority of voters acknowledge the tariffs are delivering a bruising body blow to the economy in the near term. Will time reduce the pain? Some think it will, but a majority don't envision that happening,"" Quinnipiac University polling analyst Tim Malloy emphasized.

Given a list of four economic issues and asked which one worries voters the most right now, 47% of those questioned in the poll said the price of food and consumer goods, with one-in-five saying the cost of housing or rent, 17% saying the stock market, and 6% pointing to their job situation.
""In a rare moment of political unanimity, Democrats, Republicans and independents in equal numbers worry most about the prices of what they eat and what they buy,"" Malloy noted.

According to the poll, voters were divided over which party they think cares more about the needs and problems of people like them.
A third of respondents said the Democratic Party, with an equal amount (33%) saying the Republican Party. Thirty-one percent answered that neither party cared more.

What’s most striking aboutPresident Trump’stariff war is that he’s being pressured by some of his closest advisers and supporters to end the crusade that has upended the world economy.
It’s not just media conservatives like Ben Shapiro, Rich Lowry, Ben Domenech and the Wall Street Journal editorial page. It’s longtime wealthy donors like Ken Langone, co-founder of Home Depot, who denounced the tariffs and cited the 46% levy on Vietnam as an example of ""bulls---,"" telling the Financial Times that ""right now what everybody’s terrified of is a trade war.""
Another billionaire, hedge fund investor Bill Ackman, said, ""The consequences for our country and the millions of citizens who have supported the president…are going to be severely negative."" Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, said ""whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.""
WHITE HOUSE SAYS BEIJING MISSED DEADLINE TO LIFT RETALIATORY TARIFFS, US TO HIKE CHINA TARIFFS TO 104%
The most famous defector isElon Musk, who, according to the Washington Post, privately urged Trump not to go ahead with the sky-high tariffs. Now, he’s gone public.
""Ideally, both Europe and the United States should move to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America."" Even the world’s richest man and chief budget cutter couldn’t convince the boss, and he is off the reservation.
Musk is also taking shots at the strongest tariff booster in theWhite House, Peter Navarro, calling him ""truly a moron,"" ""dumber than a sack of bricks,"" and, in a particularly juvenile jab, ""Peter Navarrdo.""
In addition to sounding off against President Donald Trump's tariffs, Elon Musk, right, has thrown a few rhetorical punches at the staunchly pro-tariff Peter Navarro.(AP)
The aforementioned Navarro, you’ll be happy to hear, went on Fox and guaranteed there will be no recession. So you can all resume regular breathing.
It doesn’t help Trump that after the early rebound rally yesterday ran out of gas, the Dow dropped another 320 points, after a dramatic decline that has decimated people’s stock holdings and 401-Ks. The Constitution, by the way, says Congress is in charge of tariffs.
Almost no one is safe, includingBibi Netanyahu, who came to the White House on Monday in a ring-kissing gesture, has imposed no levies on the U.S. but still got hit with a 17% tariff. Against Israel, our chief ally in the Middle East and the region’s only democracy?
And the escalationwith China, our biggest adversary, was predictable. Trump had hit Beijing with a 54% tariff (including an earlier 20% levy). Beijing hit back, as promised, with a 34% tariff on U.S. goods, battling what it calls blackmail.
Wouldn’t we have done the exact same thing if the roles were reversed?
But Trump acted as though he was personally insulted, and is now vowing an additional 50% tariff on the Chinese. This is how trade wars spiral out of control. And China has cut off negotiations on the sale of TikTok to an American owner.
Media blunders also fueled the market’s volatility. On Monday, Bloomberg – that is, someone identified as Walter Bloomberg, not connected to any news outlet – posted this: ""HASSETT: TRUMP IS CONSIDERING A 90-DAY PAUSE IN TARIFFS FOR ALL COUNTRIES EXCEPT CHINA.""
Media blunders – including one claiming Kevin Hassett, director of the White House economic council, said Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause – only exacerbated market volatility.(Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images)
This goosed the stock market. Except that Kevin Hassett, director of the White House economic council, never said that.
But CNBC morning anchor Carl Quintanilla told viewers, ""I think we can go with this headline. Apparently, Hassett’s been saying that Trump will consider a 90-day pause in tariffs for all countries except for China.""
Reuters then ran with this headline: ""Wall Street reverses course after Hassett’s comments on tariff pause.""
What Hassett actually said, when asked on Fox if Trump would consider a 90-day tariff pause, ""I think the president is gonna decide what the president is gonna decide."" Not exactly the same thing. But the market shot up.
The wire service later admitted the mistake. ""Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.""
TRUMP, EYEING 3RD TERM, KEEPS ATTACKING ELITE INSTITUTIONS – AND MANY ARE CAVING
A CNBC spokeswoman said later, ""As we were chasing the news of the market moves in real-time, we aired unconfirmed information in a banner. Our reporters quickly made a correction on air.""
Meghan McCain posted a broader swipe against the media. ""There are so many hypocritical talking heads on TV saying they don’t care about losing money or being infinancial painfor a while. Most of you are married to finance bros, come from rich families or have huge media contracts. You have a cushion…
""One of my best friends buys her groceries for her family based on what coupons each store has. I assure you a possible recession or huge rise in prices everywhere will be a different experience for her family than you.""

At the moment, he shows no inclination to do that, having pushed the tariff idea since the 1980s and repeatedly promising such an approach during last year’s campaign.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jeffries-claims-trump-budget-bill-steal-food-from-mouths-babies-while-enriching-billionaires,Jeffries claims Trump budget bill will steal food from 'the mouths of babies' while enriching billionaires,"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries held a press conference railing against President Donald Trump's tariff policies and a budget bill working its way through Congress.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries railed against a budget bill that would advance PresidentDonald Trump'sagenda as legislation that would take food from the mouths of babies in order to enrich billionaire ""puppet masters.""
""These MAGA extremists are trying to jam a reckless budget down the throat of the American people,"" Jeffries said during a Monday press conference. ""Take away health care from the American people. Strip away veterans benefits from the American people. And hurt nutritional assistance and literally take food out of the mouths of babies in America.""
""Why? Because they want to pass massive tax breaks for their billionaire donors and puppet masters like Elon Musk. This is Republican policy in America, and it's a complete and total disaster.""
The House's framework for the budget bill passed in February and included $4.5 trillion for extending Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and implementing newer Trump proposals like no taxes on tipped wages. Senate Republicans approved a blueprint version of the bill Saturday. The legislation currently hangs in the balance as Republican lawmakers hash out details of the final version of the bill.
The New York Democrat's press conferencewas in response to Trump's recently unveiled tariff plans that will level customized tariffs on countries that have historically higher tariffs in place on American goods, as well as a baseline tariff of 10% on other nations.

""The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!"" he posted to Truth Social Monday.

""American steel workers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen,"" Trump said from the White House Rose Garden Wednesday afternoon. ""We have a lot of them here with us today. They really suffered, gravely. They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once-beautiful American dream.

While Trump regularly showcases his performance steering the nation, some of the latest nationalpublic opinion pollssuggest Americans may not be so pleased with the job he's doing as president.
The president stands at 43% approval and 53% disapproval in a Reuters/Ipsos survey conducted March 31-April 2, and he is also underwater - at 46%-51% - in a Wall Street Journal poll in the field March 27-April 1.
While a survey from the Daily Mail, which was also conducted over the past week, suggested Trump's approval rating is in positive territory, the majority of the national public opinion surveys in the field since mid-March indicate Trump in negative territory.
WHERE TRUMP STANDS IN THE LATEST FOX NEWS NATIONAL POLL
Trump has seen his numbers edge down slightly since the start of his second term, when an average of his polls indicated the president's approval rating in the low 50s and his disapproval in the mid-40s.
Contributing to the slide are increasing concerns over the economy and inflation, which was a pressing issue that kept former PresidentJoe Biden’sapproval ratings well below water for most of his presidency.
Additionally, the latest surveys were conducted nearly entirely before Trump's blockbuster tariff announcement last week, which sparked a trade war with the nation's top trading partners, triggered a massive sell-off in the financial markets, and increased concerns about a recession.
When asked about the market plunge, the president told reporters on Sunday evening, ""Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.""

Daron Shaw, a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas who serves as a member of the Fox News Decision Team and is the Republican partner on the Fox News poll, calls the economy ""the 800-pound gorilla.""
According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, only 37% of Americans approve of the job the president's doing on the economy, with 52% giving him a thumbs down.
Trump's numbers on the economy are slightly better in the Wall Street Journal poll - 44% approval and 52% disapproval - but still underwater.
HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING, ANALYSIS, AND OPINION ON PRESIDENT TRUMP
Shaw suggested that over the past week the president has been ""slowly losing the argument that tariffs are part of a larger program that will bring down prices.""
""He’s got his work cut out for him….he’s losing the narrative,"" Shaw said of Trump. ""He’s got to make the case that tariffs are part of a larger economic plan that’s going to deal with problems that people feel.""
The only issue where Trump is in positive territory in the Reuters/Ipsos and Wall Street Journal polls is immigration and border security, which, along with inflation, was another top issue that helped catapult him back into the White House.

However, Shaw noted that Trump's success has blunted the importance of the issue.
""The broader narrative is that he’s had success on border security and has essentially tabled that as an issue,"" he argued. ""One of the problems of succeeding is that it’s something that you no longer really talk about. It’s no longer at the top of people’s issue priorities. So one of his dominant issues has been neutralized by his success on the issue.""

While Trump's poll numbers are edging down in most surveys, they are still superior to ratings during his first term in office. Trump’s poll numbers were almost entirely in negative territory in most surveys for the entirety of his first term in office.
""Keep these numbers in perspective. The numbers he’s averaging right now are still higher than he was at any point during his first presidency,"" veteran Republican pollster Neil Newhouse told Fox News.
Newhouse emphasized that Trump's Republican ""base is strongly behind him,"" which was not the case at the start of his first term in the White House.

Trump pointed to the European Union during his announcement, and explained the U.S. will charge the EU a 20% tariff, compared to its39%tariffs on the U.S. Japan will see24% tariffs, compared to the 46% the country charges the U.S., while China will be hit with a34% tariff, compared to the 67% it charges the U.S.
The customized tariffs, Trump explained, would not be full reciprocal tariffs, as his administration was ""very kind"" and leveled tariffs that are roughly half of what a particular nation was charging the U.S. on tariffs.
""For nations that treat us badly, we will calculate the combined rate of all their tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating,"" Trump said Wednesday.
HERE'S WHAT TRUMP IS REALLY UP TO WITH HIGH-STAKES TARIFF GAMBIT
""And because we are being very kind, we will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,"" he said. ""So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal. I could have done that. Yes. But it would have been tough for a lot of countries.""
Fox News Digital examined the full tariff list and spoke to experts about who stands to lose the most due to the tariffs, and who will likely benefit and tackle the new tariffs victoriously.

Fox News Digital spoke with Samir Kapadia, a managing principal at the lobbying and advisory firmthe Vogel Group, who explained Vietnam will likely lose the most business due to the upcoming tariffs.
""Vietnam has long been an amicable trade partner with the United States for a variety of sectors, whether that would be textiles and apparel or computers and consumer electronics, but there has been a gross inequity in the bilateral trade relationship. Vietnam simply doesn't have the economy or the resources to import from the United States and to… provide that reciprocity,"" Kapadia explained.
Vietnam charges the U.S. a 90% tariff on imported goods to the nation. The Trump administration last week announced the Southeast Asian country will face a46% tariff on goods importedto the U.S.
Vietnam's industries are also deeply rooted in Chinese business investments, Kapadia said.

""To add insult to injury, they also have been a hot bed for Chinese investment. Since the imposition of the Section 301 tariffs under the first Trump administration, which were these large-scale tariffs on Chinese imports, you had a whole number of Chinese companies across a variety of industries in the consumer product segment basically invest, instead, in factories in Vietnam as a way to circumvent paying tariffs, so the Chinese would keep their market share, but just go and make it in another country,"" he explained.

Trump signed a memo under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 in 2018 under his first administration targeting Chinese goods for U.S. tariffs in response to Chinese theft of American intellectual property, Trump said at the time.
""This was by far the worst day for the Vietnamese government, in the sense, they're realizing that that door has now closed. A 46% tariff – Vietnam is not an attractive country to import from. The numbers won't work,"" Kapadia said of the new rounds of tariffs targeting Vietnam.
The Asian nation has already felt the pinch, and called on Trump to delay the tariffs from taking effect this weekend.
AFTER TRUMP TARIFFS, JPMORGAN RAISES CHANCE OF RECESSION TO 60%
Vietnam's leader To Lam wrote a letter to Trump on Saturday, the New York Times reported, asking him to delay the imposition of the tariffs for at least 45 days and for the pair of world leaders to meet in Washington, D.C., in May ""to jointly come to an agreement on this important matter, for the benefit of both our peoples and to contribute to peace, stability and development in the region and the world.""

The ""biggest losers"" from Trump's Wednesday announcement are ""without question"" China and Vietnam, Kapadia said.
China was hit with a 34% tariff as part of Trump's announcement last week, which is in addition to previous tariffs leveled on the nation. Kappadia said the newest upcoming tariff and the ""high-band"" tariffs of 45% on some Chinese goods puts the country's tariff barrier at about 75% to 80%, which Kapadia predicted could grow to 150% by the end of 2025.
""That's because there's just a lot of ongoing challenges with China that have not begun to kind of roll-out or get resolved, and ultimately the United States is going to have to continue to pressure U.S. companies to invest more in the United States, and the only way to do that is to continue to put pressure on China,"" Kapadia said.
The trade expert continued that other nations, particularly European export sectors, could also see fallout from the tariff plan in regard to luxury products or household purchases, but that it's too early to predict where the chips will fall with Europe.
""I think that that might resolve itself over time, depending upon how the Europeans behave. From what we've seen, just early next week, we're going to have some dignitaries and officials from Europe come and visit the president to negotiate on a potential resolution. All in the meanwhile, they are threatening a retaliatory 20% tariff to kind of make this tit-for-tat based on the reciprocal tariff announcement, but we know from the president that all that's going to do is turn the 20% that we put on Europe to 40%,"" he said.
Kapadia pointed to India and Japan as the two nations that will benefit from Trump's tariff plan last week.
HERE’S A CLOSER LOOK AT TRUMP’S TARIFF PLAN: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW DUTIES
""We have seen both the Japanese head of state and the Indian head of state come to Washington and provide the president with opportunities where they would then reduce their own tariff barriers,"" he said.
""Just a week before this announcement, Prime Minister Modi came out and provided a whole list to the government… that says, 'Here are all the things that I'm going to reduce, in terms of tariffs of U.S. exports to India' And so I think that's going to continue. And I think that they're going to make headway at getting toward more equitable trade between the two countries,"" he added.
Trump unveiled a 27% tariff on India on ""Liberation Day"" and a 24% tariff on Japan.

""I think that they're going to make headway at getting toward more equitable trade between the two countries, whether that's India and the U.S. or Japan and the U.S., and honestly serves to the U.S.' benefit to rectify some of those tariff barriers with India,"" he said. ""It is the largest democratic country in the world, and they are strategic ally for geopolitical reasons and a number of other considerations. And so they're going to be a country that I think we have to watch and really see how they negotiate their way through this new tariff regime.""
Kapadia pointed to a handful of U.S. companies that operate in India, such as Lego, Apple and Goldman Sachs, and predicted companies that have made large-scale investments in India will likely stay there, while they will likely move other overseas operations in nations facing even higher tariffs, such as Vietnam, to India.
TRUMP TOUTS RETURN OF ‘AMERICAN DREAM’ IN HISTORIC TARIFF ANNOUNCEMENT
""You name it, a whole slew of U.S. companies have made concerted, large-scale investments in India. I think that they're going to stick to them. I think they're going to grow there. And if you look at the difference, just on our arbitrage basis, 46% versus 26% – that's a big Delta. So if you're Apple, and you're making Apple technology, Apple-related products in Vietnam, and you're importing at 46%, or you're making it in India at 26%, you're obviously going to double down on your India effort,"" he said.

Kapadia continued that Trump's latest tariff policies target corporate America, which opens the doors to which industries will move back to U.S. soil to avoid the tariffs. He pointed to ""critical industries"" such as semiconductor manufacturing, critical minerals, aluminum and steel manufacturing delivering large-scale investments in the U.S. both this year and next year, to increase capacity and production ""out of necessity."" He noted that Trump's customized reciprocal tariffs are not stackable with existing tariffs on certain industry imports, such as steel and aluminum.
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED DURING TRUMP'S 11TH WEEK IN OFFICE
""That's going to be the opportunity for the jobs to be created, for the investment to happen. Whereas on the multilateral kind of, 'Hey, here's our new kind of blended rate for these 60 odd countries,' that's just going to be finding more equity with a foreign direct investment from those countries,"" he said.

""They did a study by the Census Bureau in 1949, and they looked at the top 20 most influential cities that were prosperous in the United States. And I want you to think about some of these names on this [list]. They're names like Buffalo, Detroit, Cleveland, Youngstown, Allentown, Pittsburgh. That isn't the case anymore. For the 50 years after that, we saw both political parties celebrate putting jobs across in other countries,"" Rulli said.
Rulli reflected on 1977's ""Black Monday"" in Youngstown, Ohio, when steel manufacturer Campbell Works of Youngstown Sheet and Tube shuttered its doors and left thousands of workers unemployed in a chilling move that is still felt in the area today.

It's really a great triumph,"" he said.
With jobs, Rulli argued, crime and addiction woes that have plagued the nation in recent years will fall, while generations of families that previously worked in the steel industry can carry on the tradition,

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called out theUnited Auto Workers(UAW) union on Friday for endorsing President Donald Trump’s automobile tariffs.
In a CNN appearance, the lawmaker argued that UAW support for Trump’s tariffs is misguided, noting that even if some elements of Trump’s policy are good, overall, they will hurt American families.
""Look, I respect them [UAW]. But the tariffs – if they wanted to do something about auto – should have been much more pinpointed and isolated than this massive assault on American families, all to help the billionaires,"" Schumer told CNN host Dana Bash.
WALL STREET FIRMS SEE RECESSION RISK RISING OVER TARIFFS, TRADE WAR
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., rips the United Auto Workers union for praising Trump's recent tariffs on foreign-made automobiles and parts.
UAW presidentShawn Fain praised Trumpfor enacting major tariffs on foreign-made automobiles and parts earlier this month.
As reported by the Detroit Free Press, Fain told an audience at Wayne State University in Detroit, ""Yes, I disagree with Donald Trump on virtually everything, but [tariffs are] one thing I don’t disagree on.""
Fain, who has been a fierce critic of Trump – expressing support for former Vice President Kamala Harris’s White House run during the Democratic National Convention last year – added that the Democratic Party hasn’t done the work to protect the American auto industry.
""We’ve begged Democrats, politicians for years, to do something to get these companies in line,"" he said, also noting that he’s not afraid to praise Trump on the issue, even if the president is a Republican.
TRUMP IS 'ALWAYS UP FOR A GOOD NEGOTIATION,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS, AS APRIL 2 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS LOOM

""I’m not going to sit here now and say that since he’s a Republican or because he’s Donald Trump, I’m going to say, ‘screw you.’ That’s not how we do things. It’s having integrity,"" Fain said.
Trump instituted 25% tariffs on outsourced cars and auto parts last week, which is primed to hitdomestic brands like Chevrolet– which now produces vehicles in Mexico like the popular Equinox, and shuttered its major Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in 2020.
However, Schumer suggested that UAW is ignoring the negative effects of Trump’s tariff policies on the whole country while focusing on the good it affords them.
""Look, there are certain tariffs that – pinpointed, careful, aimed at things that other countries are doing badly at us – makes sense. This is not that. This is across the board, 10% on everything, in addition to what other tariffs he‘s put on,"" the Senate Minority Leader said.
When Bash asked about whether the auto tariffs by themselves are good, he replied, ""Well, look, you have to look at it in the whole context of things. When there‘s such chaos in America, I think fewer Americans are going to buy cars - American cars or otherwise - because it‘s so chaotically done. So, I think it hurts everybody.""

Bash also asked Schumer about how he has been responding toDemocratic lawmakers questioning his leadershipin recent weeks after he broke party ranks and voted for a GOP-approved continuing resolution to keep the government from shutting down.
Schumer replied by stating that he and the Democratic Party are looking ahead and taking the fight to Trump with a united front.
""We are now focused on the future, and we are focused on showing how awful this administration is,"" he said. ""And you‘re going to find all of us [Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J.], myself, and the whole Democratic Party united on what to do, and going forward, and going after Trump day in and day out, showing the American people that Trump has betrayed them, that he’s broken his promises, and that we’re on the side of working people, and he’s on the side of billionaires.""

'Fox & Friends' co-hosts weigh in.
A conservative legal group is challenging PresidentDonald Trump's tariffs on China, calling them ""an unlawful attempt"" to make Americans pay higher taxes on Chinese imports.
The New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) filed an initial complaint in Florida district court Thursday, challenging Trump's ""unlawful use of emergency power to impose a tariff on all imports from China.""
""By invoking emergency power to impose an across-the-board tariff on importsfrom Chinathat the statute does not authorize, President Trump has misused that power, usurped Congress’s right to control tariffs, and upset the Constitution’s separation of powers,"" Andrew Morris, senior litigation counsel at NCLA, said in a statement released.

Trump issued anexecutive orderon Feb. 1 titled ""Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China,"" and amended it on Mar. 3 to raise tariffs on Chinese imports from 10% to 20%.
Plaintiff Emily Ley, owner of Simplified, a Pensacola, Florida-based company, argues Trump's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose the tariffs is unlawful. The plaintiff also argues that her business will be harmed as a result of Trump's action.
""The key thing for all of this is that IEEPA does not provide for the tariff power, and you know that because when Congress does do it, they use the word, and they say how the president is supposed to do it,"" John Vecchione, senior litigation counsel at NCLA, told Fox News Digital.
Vecchione notes that the complaint delineates the various statutes Trump used in his first term to impose tariffs, saying that in this instance, he is ""using the wrong statute.""
""Here, [Trump] declares an emergency, and then he says that his tariffs fit the emergency, that they're necessary for the emergency,"" Vecchione said. ""IEEPA requires that they be necessary for the emergency, and they're not.""

The plaintiff argues that the law permits the president to ""order sanctions as a rapid response to international emergencies,"" but does not authorize him to ""impose tariffs on the American people.""
""President Trump’s executive orders imposing a China tariff are, therefore, ultra vires and unconstitutional,"" the complaint states.
If the president is granted such authority, the group argues, he would have ""nearly unlimited authority to commandeerCongress’s powerover tariffs.""
""He would be empowered to declare a national emergency based on some long-running national problem,"" the complaint continues, ""then impose tariffs purportedly in the name of that emergency – thus sidestepping the detailed constraints Congress has placed on the tariff authority it has granted.""
NCLA is asking the court to block the administration from implementing or enforcing the executive orders and to vacate ""all resulting modifications"" to the tariff schedule.
In response to the lawsuit, White House principal deputy press secretary Harrison Fields defended the executive orders, telling Fox News Digital, ""President Trump has broad authority to impose tariffs to address issues of national emergency, such as the opioid pandemic. The Trump administration looks forward to victory in court.""
The suit comes just days after the president unveiled his tariff plan during a speech in theWhite HouseRose Garden at a highly anticipated ""Make America Wealthy Again"" event.
""Now it's our turn to prosper, and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt,"" Trump said on April 2. ""And it will all happen very quickly. With today's action, we are finally going to be able to make America great again, greater than ever before.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-rand-paul-terminate-trump-tariffs-before-its-too-late,SEN RAND PAUL: Terminate the Trump tariffs before it's too late,"President Donald Trump predicts US will ultimately flourish and 'boom' because of his tariffs plan.
If you think eggs are expensive, just wait until the new tariffs hit cars. Goldman Sachs estimates tariffs on imported vehicles could raise prices by $5,000 to $15,000. That’s because tariffs are taxes on foreign imports that are paid by American consumers. These tariffs apply to almost every conceivable product. As a result, energy will be more expensive, andgas pricesin some parts of the country could see as much as a 70-cent increase in the cost per gallon. According to the National Association of Home Builders, the building of a single-family home could become up to $10,000 more expensive because of the tariffs. With the tariffs on aluminum, even beer and hard seltzer are likely to increase in price.
Unfortunately, these tax increases are on top ofthe taxesyou have already paid when tariffs were imposed during the first Trump administration. The Tax Foundation calculated that tariffs between 2018 and 2023 imposed an additional $1,753 in costs on American families. Now that the tariffs apply to even more products, the tax increases are poised to be even higher this time. The Peterson Institute predicts tariffs could annually cost families $1,200 a year, while Yale’s Budget Lab estimates the tariffs would cost the average American family $4,200 annually.
The fact that tariffs are taxes paid by consumers is not news to the American people. That is why vehicle sales jumped almost 13%  last month as Americans sought to make their purchases before the 25% tariffs on motor vehicles and parts went into effect.
VICE PRESIDENT JD VANCE SAYS TRUMP IS 'TAKING THIS ECONOMY IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION'
Conservatives used to publicly acknowledge that tariffs are taxes paid by Americans. Milton Friedman stated plainly that tariffs ""raise prices to customers and waste our resources."" Ronald Reagan similarly opposed protectionism because it ""costs consumers billions of dollars, damages the overall economy, and destroys jobs.""
But the actions of those who now advocate for tariffs acknowledge the damage tariffs cause, even if their words do not. Recently, the Secretary of Agriculture indicated the administration was preparing programs to mitigate ""economic catastrophes"" for farmers harmed by tariffs—a clear admission that tariffs hurt Americans. The firstTrump administrationauthorized $28 billion in farmer bailouts to offset financial losses caused by tariffs. Do Americans expect to get hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars back from the government to pay for their increased costs caused by the tariffs? Of course not.
Tariffs are not just bad for American families and the national economy; tariffs are also bad for Republicans.

Tariffs have been electoral disasters for Republicans. The McKinley Tariff of 1890 caused such a spike in prices that theRepublican Partylost nearly 100 seats in the House and by the end of the next election, the House, Senate, and White House were all in Democratic hands.
When the House passed the Smoot-Hawley tariff on May 28, 1929, stock prices in New York fell in June. Senate passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff on March 24, 1930, triggered a dramatic fall in stock prices.And, on June 17, 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed the bill into law, the stock market plummeted even farther.
The 1930 Smoot-Hawley tariff worsened the Great Depression and wiped out the Republican Party. By 1933, Republicans lost over 100 seats in the House as well as their majorities in both chambers of Congress.
Even seniority and power could not save the tariff’s authors and president who signed it into law the next time they faced the voters. Oregon Republican Congressman WillisHawley, who served 26 years in the House, was not renominated to return to his seat. After serving five terms in the Senate, RepublicanSenator Reed Smoot,of Utah, was defeated in 1932. And, Herbert Hoover, the Republican president who signed Smoot-Hawley into law, lost the White House in a landslide to Franklin Roosevelt.

The truth is that tariffs are taxes. They don’t punish foreign governments; they punish American families. When we tax imports, we raise the price of everything from groceries to smartphones, washing machines, and every other conceivable product. It’s time we saved the American people from high prices and prevent the Democrat restoration to power. It’s time to terminate the tariffs.

Americans have shown a real dislike for the wave offederal regulations targeting home appliances.Even more infuriating is the fact that our tax dollars bankroll this unwanted agenda. It is time to pull the plug on those inside and outside the government who make a living micromanaging our appliance choices.
A threatened regulatory crackdown on gas stoves in 2023 sparked a surprisingly strong public backlash, but it did not deterBiden administration regulatorsfrom going after nearly every other home appliance, including washing machines, refrigerators, furnaces, dishwashers, air conditioners, light bulbs and water heaters.
Most of these rules are from the Department of Energy (DOE), specifically its Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE). That office has an annual budget north of $3 billion and a staff of hundreds, about a quarter of which is devoted to energy efficiency.
GOP LAWMAKERS UNLEASH PROPOSAL TO REVERSE BIDEN'S 'ILL-INFORMED' POLICIES CRIPPLING CRUCIAL INDUSTRY
Just about every cliché there is for a bureaucracy run amok – moving back the goalposts, mission creep etc. – is true in spades for EERE and its energy efficiency regulations. Many appliances have been subjected to three, four, or even five rounds of successively tighter energy efficiency regulations over the years, with no end in sight.

At this point, it is not unusual for regulations to substantially boost the up-front cost of an appliance, in some cases more than is likely to be earned back in the form of energy savings.  Nor is it out of the ordinary for standards to compromise appliance choice, features, performance, or reliability in the single-minded obsession with forcing less energy use.
To take but one example, EERE regulated traditional incandescent light bulbs off the market by imposing a series of efficiency regulations they cannot meet. Taking their place over the last decade have been light-emitting diode (LED) bulbs, which are more efficient and can meet the standards but cost more and are not to everyone’s liking.
To be fair, the initial assault on incandescent bulbs was required under a 2007 statute, but as usual the regulators have now gone beyond any legal requirements. The most recent light bulb regulation, published last April, is so strict that most currently available LEDs can’t comply either, and average prices will rise from $2.98 to an agency-estimated $5.68. Keep those candles handy.
Even worse are regulations that compromise appliance performance, such as the dishwasher regulations that have doubled the time it takes to do a load from about an hour in pre-standards models to more than two today. Rather than try to fix the problems with existing dishwasher regulations, the Biden DOE came out with yet another set of incrementally tighter energy and water use limits – its fifth overall.
Climate change became the Biden administration’s all-purpose rationale for further tightening the screws on appliances. This explains the efforts to use these regulations to discourage appliances that run on natural gas, a fossil fuel. Beyond stoves, other appliances that come in both electric and natural gas versions, such as furnaces and water heaters, now face costly regulations designed to tilt the market away from gas. In the case of furnaces, the additional cost of a compliant gas model could be as high as $867, the agency estimates.
Assisting the federal regulators inside the government is an army of activists outside of it who also make a nice living – partially at taxpayer expense – off the appliance game. This includes organizations that focus primarily on appliance regulations as well as big environmental groups that cover appliance efficiency along with many other green causes.
For example, the Rocky Mountain Institute, which remains at the forefront of the efforts to ban gas stoves, has no less than six federal agencies contributing part of its $139 million dollar annual budget.
Several of these groups have recently received extra cash pursuant to the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Even some manufacturers have been showered with IRA giveaways stretching into the tens of millions of dollars each to make appliances favored by this agenda.
Stacey Abrams is part of Rewiring America, which received $2 billion from the Biden administration.(CBS)
Political favoritism appears to play a role in deciding who gets these handouts. For example, Democrat Stacey Abrams, after twice losing the Georgia governor’s race, moved on to a leadership position at an environmental organization called Rewiring America that is active in this space.
In particular, Rewiring America is pushing hard to eliminate natural gas appliances and make homes completely dependent on electricity. And now, the organization is part of a new coalition named Power Forward Communities that received a whopping $2 billion dollar IRA grant last April.

These organizations can be counted on to fight for tougher appliance regulations. Several regularly submit comments to DOE in support of measures they want and against ones they don’t, and some also sit on agency advisory committees that help fashion new rules. Many also push for state and local building code changes that favor their preferred appliance choices, and they now have millions in IRA grants to help stack the deck in their favor. These activities may not necessarily be illegal, but it is doubtful taxpayers would approve.
In addition, many green groups are involved in a never-ending stream of lawsuits against DOE, always on the side of more appliance red tape and often with the government paying attorneys’ fees. Expect these litigants to pull out all the stops against any Trump administration reform efforts, as they did during the first Trump administration.
Assisting the federal regulators inside the government is an army of activists outside of it who also make a nice living – partially at taxpayer expense – off the appliance game.
Bottom line – homeowners’ tax dollars are going to organizations that push for unwanted appliance meddling. Fortunately,President Donald Trumpis reconsidering many of the regulations, and the Department of Government Efficiency is looking for ways to stem further harmful outlays under the IRA. Congress is also targeting some specific appliance rules for repeal under the Congressional Review Act.

But ultimately, the underlying laws must be changed. First, Congress needs to sunset EERE’s appliance regulatory program and the government bureaucracy that lives off it. Just as important, Congress should defund all the organizations that have grown around this program, including blocking the IRA dollars not yet spent.
Neither the appliance bureaucrats nor their activist allies have the support of the American people. Both should stop getting our money.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-issues-prognosis-us-after-tariffs-medical-metaphor,Trump issues ‘prognosis’ for US after tariffs in medical metaphor,"Vice President JD Vance joins Lawrence Jones on ‘FOX & Friends’ to break down the Trump administration’s 'Liberation Day' tariffs and denies reports that Elon Musk is leaving the DOGE team.
PresidentDonald Trumpon Thursday used a medical metaphor to describe the status of his ""reciprocal tariffs"" plan implemented on what he dubbed ""Liberation Day.""
""THE OPERATION IS OVER! THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!""
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened more than 1,000 points lower on Thursday morning after Trump unveiled his most severe levy of tariffs yet during a White House Rose Garden ceremony a day earlier, but administration officials remained optimistic in early morning TV interviews. They touted an anticipated impact of onshoringU.S. manufacturingand further bolstering American jobs.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN the U.S. ""is no longer going to be cheated by foreign nations around the world,"" reiterating that Trump had declared the issue a ""national emergency.""

""We have a $1.2 trillion trade deficit and counting. We've had 90,000 factories close in the last couple of decades,"" Leavitt told CNN. ""Since 1997, Americans have been put out of five million manufacturing jobs. These are not just statistics. These are real American lives that have been impacted. And it's about time we have a president who actually does something about it. This is going to restore more wealth, more jobs, more economic prosperity to our great country.""
Leavitt said that the countries targeted by Trump’s reciprocal tariffs have had ""70 years to do the right thing by the American people, and they have chosen not to.""
""They have ripped off American workers. They have taken our jobs overseas,"" Leavitt said.
She also told CNN that Trump has already launched a ""massive deregulatory agenda"" that has ""saved the American taxpayer millions of dollars."" Leavvitt said that the president is ""unleashing the might of our American energy industry,"" arguing that a stifled energy industry drove inflation during former President Joe Biden’s administration.
Vice President JD Vancetold ""FOX & Friends"" on Thursday morning that critics during Trump’s first term warned that tariffs would be inflationary, but instead inflation dipped to 1.5% until the ""four terrible years of the Biden administration."" Vance said the ""globalist economy"" has resulted in the U.S. ""incurring a huge amount of debt to buy things that other countries make for us.""

""To make it a little bit more crystal clear, we borrow money from Chinese peasants to buy the things thoseChinese peasants manufacture,""Vance said. ""That is not a recipe for economic prosperity. It's not a recipe for low prices, and it's not a recipe for good jobs in the United States of America.""
SOME COUNTRIES TARGETED BY TRUMP TARIFFS SEEK NEGOTIATIONS, CHINA SAYS 'NO WINNERS IN TRADE WARS'
The vice president said the ""Joe Biden globalist pathway"" has resulted in the U.S. having $2 trillion in peacetime debt and deficits and manufacturing ""disappearing,"" promising that Trump is taking the country in a different direction.
Addressing criticism from Wall Street following Trump’s""Liberation Day""event in the White House Rose Garden, Vance said that ""a lot of people have gotten rich from American jobs moving overseas, but American workers have not gotten rich"" and American companies ""have not gotten wealthy from the increasing growth of foreign competitors manufacturing overseas.""
""They charge us ridiculous tariffs. They engage in a lot of non-tariff practices like currency manipulation,"" he said. ""That has been awful for Main Street in the United States of America.""

On concerns about tariffs potentially driving up costs, Vance said the administration is ""fighting very hard to bring prices down"" and usher in ""the biggest deregulation in the history of this country.""
Trump’s Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News that ""when tariffs come into place, foreign goods may become a little more expensive, but domestic goods do not.""
""For the first time in your lives, you're going to actually think about the Americans who make the products, the Americans who produce these products and work in these factories,"" he said. ""It's time for us to take care of them instead of taking care of the world.""
Trump said that his administration secured about $5 trillion of committed investment, which Lutnick told CBS meant ""people are going to start building factories right now.""

""That means all that construction work begins now,"" Lutnick said, vowing that the president's plan would build on the 150,000 jobs already added to the U.S. economy in March. ""That starts to employ Americans today. You're going to see plants being built, factories rebuilding. All shifts are going to be running hot across America now. You're going to see employment leaping starting today.""

Republicans hailed the move as a ""proven strategy"" and ""long overdue,"" but Democrats suggested there was nothing liberating about tariffs, which they complained will make life even more expensive for Americans.
During his Rose Garden remarks, Trump held up a poster board showing the combined rate of tariffs and other non-tariff barriers that other countries impose on U.S. exports alongside the reciprocal tariffs theTrump administrationplans to levy on imports from those countries.

Rand Paul, R-Ky., criticizes the Trump administration’s tariff policy on ‘America Reports.’
The Senate on Wednesday approved a resolution opposing President Donald Trump's tariffs on imports from Canada hours after his event championing""Liberation Day.""
Four Republicans – Sens. Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky; Susan Collins, of Maine; and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, sided with Democrats in voting for a resolution that would repeal the emergency declaration that permitted Trump to levy taxes on Canada by citing deadly fentanyl flowing across the border. The measure, introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., passed the upper chamber of Congress by a 51-48 vote.
The resolution likely won’t survive the GOP-controlled House, but its passage was a small victory for Democrats looking for their best attack line before the midterms.

Paul defended his decision to cross party lines in a speech on the Senate floor in which he quoted American revolutionary James Otis in saying, ""Taxation without representation is tyranny."" The senator said it was that longstanding principle that originated from the Magna Carta that sparked the American revolution and was incorporated into the Constitution by the Founding Fathers.
""And yet today, we are here before the Senate because one person in our country wishes to raise taxes,"" Paul said. ""Well, this is contrary to everything our country was founded upon. One person is not allowed to raise tax. The Constitution forbids it.""
Paul said the Founding Fathers ""so feared the power of taxation that they gave it only to Congress.""
""I stand against the idea of skipping democracy, of skippingthe constitutional republic,of rejecting our founding principles, not because I have any animus towards the president,"" Paul said. ""I do this because I love my country, and I want to see the division of power enabled such that it protects us all from the amalgamation of power into one person such that it can be abused. Another name for emergency rule is martial law.""

""This is a tax, plain and simple,"" he said of Trump’s Canada tariffs. ""Taxes should not be enacted by one person. So I will vote today to end the emergency. I will vote today to try to reclaim the power of taxation, the power of the tariff, to where the Constitution designated it should properly be, and that is in Congress.""
Trump called outPaul, McConnell, Collins and Murkowski in a post to Truth Social early Wednesday, saying that the four would hopefully ""get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change, and fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl, by Tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy.""
THESE ARE THE 'DIRTY 15' COUNTRIES TRUMP MIGHT TARGET WITH LIBERATION DAY TARIFFS
""They are playing with the lives of the American people, and right into the hands of the Radical Left Democrats and Drug Cartels,"" Trump wrote. ""The Senate Bill is just a ploy of the Dems to show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four, in that it is not going anywhere because the House will never approve it and I, as your President, will never sign it. Why are they allowing Fentanyl to pour into our Country unchecked, and without penalty. What is wrong with them, other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, commonly known as TDS?""
The president said the four Republicans have been ""extremely difficult to deal with"" and ""unbelievably disloyal"" to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.

The Democratic Party has been battling an identity crisis since November’s election resulted in Republicans controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House.
As Democrats strategized on how to emphasize Republican internal divisions, Kaine used one of the few ways the minority party could force a floor vote. Congress has the authority to overturn emergency resolutions.
The measure opposing Trump's tariffs on Canada passed hours after the president hosted a""Make America Wealthy Again"" eventin which he announced an executive order instituting ""reciprocal tariffs"" on various countries.

""Today we're standing upfor the American worker,and we are finally putting America first,"" he added.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/what-americas-working-class-really-wants-and-why-politicians-keep-ignoring-them,"What America’s working class really wants, and why politicians keep ignoring them","Fox News contributor Richard Fowler discusses the top issues of concern among voters in the upcoming election on 'America Reports.'
Some wear red hats at political rallies, while others wear blue T-shirts at union protests. Deep down, they’re fighting fora shot at an American Dreamthat now feels more like a mirage.
Whether it’s United Auto Workers leaning into PresidentDonald Trump’s message of ""Make America Great Again"" or Chicago public school educators digging into their pockets to buy supplies for vulnerable students, the working class represents an electorate long ignored by Washington.
Both Democrats and the Trump-informed Republican Party claim to champion workers, but working-class families nationwide still lack real, consistent representation in the halls of power.

I’ve seen it up close – alongside educators, higher education faculty, healthcare workers and public employees. I’ve also listened to factory workers, grocery clerks, long-haul drivers and warehouse staff. Whether in a union hall in the Rust Belt, a hospital in the Sunbelt, or a classroom in Detroit, the message is the same:working people feel unheardand undervalued.
THE SURPRISING WAY TRUMP CAN UNLEASH AMERICA’S ECONOMIC COMEBACK
Labor unions, often demonized by big business and political operatives, are the sum of their parts: everyday working people striving for better.
That includes cafeteria workers who kept schoolchildren fed during the pandemic, even when schools were closed; hospital technicians pulling overnight shifts so patients receive care; sanitation crews braving winter storms to keep cities clean; and adjunct professors educating future leaders while barely scraping by. These Americans come together not for power or profit but for dignity – fighting for better pay, safer conditions and a stable life.
But this isn’t just about unions. Millions of workers –unionized or not– are exhausted, underpaid and navigating broken systems. Yet, they remain the backbone of our economy. In fact, consumer spending by working– and middle-class families accounts for nearly 70% of U.S. economic activity – a staggering figure that underscores how deeply labor and livelihoods are tied to the nation’s financial health.
NEW DEMS READY TO MOVE PARTY AND COUNTRY BEYOND TRUMP CHAOS
Educators, from kindergarten teachers to adjunct professors, are still paid less than their peers in other fields while facing burnout. Healthcare workers are stretched thin in understaffed facilities. Public employees are asked to do more with less. Meanwhile, private-sector workerscontinue to face job insecurity, outsourcing and wage stagnation.
Though working-class voters across much of the South and Midwest helped send Donald Trump back to the White House, they also voted pretty clearly on the issues – including higher wages, paid leave, public schools and reproductive rights.
On a recent visit to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania – and at town halls across the country – I saw and heard the same thing: people are tired. Tired of broken promises. Tired of political theater. Tired of seeing their lives used as props during elections, only to be forgotten once the votes are counted.
The most powerful stories don’t come from podiums. They come from the nurses in North Carolina who are marching to the state Capitol to demand safer staffing. They also come from the stadium workers in Detroit who haven’t taken a sick day in years because missing a paycheck could mean missing rent.

These aren’t abstract issues. They’re daily realities. And the people living them deserve more than lip service. Their perseverance, sacrifice and quiet acts of love should be at thecenter of our political conversations.
It’s time leaders started listening – not just during campaigns but always. The working class isn’t asking for much, just respect, a living wage, good schools, affordable healthcare and a dignified life.
That shouldn’t be too much to ask in the wealthiest country in the world. And yet, here we are.

The results of Missouri’s 2024 ballot measures, loudly and clearly, said what the people wanted. But too often, lawmakers choose special interests over the public interest.
Even with poll after poll showing American support for neighborhood public schools, members of Congress are pushing a national school choice bill that would drain public dollars into private institutions. If we want to rebuild trust in our democracy, we have to listen to the people who keep it running. The ones who teach, heal, build and serve. The people in red hats and blue T-shirts who, despite the noise, are more united than we think.

All of us oweDonald Trump and Elon Muska deep debt of gratitude.
For a very long time the big money interests, under Democratic and Republican administrations, have dominated our government and our politics. They did it through their campaign contributions, the work of their corporate lobbyists and the extravagant dinners where the rich and the powerful plotted their strategies. Much of their work was done quietly and out of public scrutiny. They had the power. They just didn’t advertise it.
Not anymore.

Donald Trumpinvited the three wealthiest people in the country, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg to sit right behind him at his inauguration. And behind them were 13 other billionaires who Trump had nominated to run major government agencies. In other words, the power of big money was no longer something to be kept secret. Trump was showing the entire world that the billionaire class was running our government. It was there for all to see.
NEW DEMS READY TO MOVE PARTY AND COUNTRY BEYOND TRUMP CHAOS
But it’s not just Trump whom we should applaud for his openness. It’sElon Musk. Ever since the disastrous Citizens UnitedSupreme Court decision of 2010, billionaires and their super-PACs in both political parties have been controlling our political process and buying and selling politicians.
But no one has been as transparent about that as Musk. He donated over $270 million to Trump’s campaign, and was rewarded by becoming the most powerful person in the government. Nothing complicated about that. You pay for what you get.
Further, he has made it clear that any member of Congress who votes against the Trump-Musk agenda will be opposed by him and his unlimited financial resources. Nothing subtle about that either. Money talks. You do as I say or my money ends your political career.

So, what does it all mean? What are the implications of having a government run by the billionaire class?
JAMES CARVILLE: TOO MANY DEMOCRATS ARE LOSING THEIR MINDS OVER TRUMP. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY
There are those who believe that Mr. Musk and the other billionaires in Trump’s Cabinet, smart, hard-working and successful business people, are sacrificing their time and energy to make the government more efficient and effective – and that we should be very grateful for their efforts.
I don’t agree.
Let’s take a hard look at what’s now happening all around us and see if ""efficiency"" is the major goal of these billionaires.
A good place to begin is withSocial Security, the most popular and successful government program in American history.

For nearly 90 years, in good times and bad, Social Security has done exactly what it was designed to do – pay out every benefit owed to every eligible American on time and without delay. Last year, it kept over 27 million Americans out of poverty.
And yet today the Trump administration and Elon Musk have been launching an all-out and unprecedented attack on Social Security.
DEMOCRATS MUST MAKE THE CASE THAT GOVERNMENT CAN BE EFFECTIVE AND GOOD
They are eliminating the ability of seniors and the disabled to apply for benefits over the phone, shutting down Social Security field offices throughout the country and planning to lay off up to half of Social Security’s staff. These disastrous cuts are not making Social Security more efficient or reducing fraud. They are doing the exact opposite.
Since Trump has been in office, Social Security’s website crashed four times in a recent 10-day period. Lines at Social Security field offices that remain open are getting longer and it’s increasingly difficult for seniors and the disabled to talk to a live human being on Social Security’s 1-800 number.
During his State of the Union, President Trump falsely suggested that ""millions and millions"" of Social Security checks are going out to people between the ages of 140 and 360. Not true. It is widely acknowledged, even by Trump’s own nominee to lead the Social Security Administration, that well over 99% of Social Security checks are going out to people who earned those benefits.No one who is 150 or 200 or 300 years old is receiving Social Security benefits.
Several weeks ago,Mr. Musk falsely claimedthat Social Security is ""the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time."" Really? This is a system that has been in effect since 1935 and has never once failed to provide benefits to those who have earned them. Some Ponzi scheme!
SEN SHELDON WHITEHOUSE: THE EPA'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION ROLLBACK PUTS AMERICANS LAST
And it’s not just Social Security that the Trump administration is attacking. They are also cutting back on the needs ofour nation’s veterans, the men and women who put their lives on the line defending our country.
At a time when the VA is facing a shortage of many thousands of doctors, nurses and other medical workers, President Trump is making a bad situation even worse by proposing to fire 83,000 employees at the VA. This will undoubtedly mean that the quality of healthcare provided there will decline and veterans will have to wait longer for the benefits they earned.
That’s not just Bernie Sanders talking. That’s what the VFW and other veterans organizations are saying. Can we make VA healthcare more efficient? Absolutely. But arbitrarily firing 83,000 employees is not the way to do it.
What else is our billionaire-led government in the process of doing? As we speak, President Trump, Mr. Musk and Republicans in Congress are laying the groundwork to pass legislation that would provide huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in the country paid for by massive cuts to healthcare, education, nutrition, housing and other programs that working families and the most vulnerable rely on.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
It has been estimated that the legislation the Republicans are writing would provide a$1.1 trillion tax breakto the top 1%. Another study found that if all of Trump’s so-called ""America First"" policies are enacted, including his tariffs, the bottom 95% of Americans will see their taxes go up, while the top 5% will see their taxes go down. Way down.
And what is the largest cut they are considering? It would be an up to $880 billion cut to Medicaid – a program that provides healthcare to tens of millions of children, two out of every three seniors in nursing homes, and 43% of the revenue for community health centers that deliver primary care to over 32 million Americans. A cut of this size would devastate our already broken healthcare system and increase healthcare costs for millions of Americans.
It is no secret that our country is deeply divided politically. In my view, however, there are very few people, whether they are conservative, progressive or moderate, who think that we should give tax breaks to billionaires and cut back on Medicaid, education and food for hungry children.

There are very few people who think we should take a chainsaw to Social Security and the VA – and threaten the well-being of our seniors and veterans.

Notably absent on the list of countries subject to tariffs were Mexico, Canada, Russia and Belarus.

The White House has kept a tight lip regarding details surroundingTrump's planned tariff announcement, only explaining reciprocal tariffs will even the playing field for the U.S. after decades of unfair trading practices.
""Ithink it's going to be something that's going to bring a lot of wealth back to our country, tremendous wealth back to our country, actually,"" Trump told the media Monday. ""And, other countries are understanding, because they've been ripping us for 50 years, longer.""
Trump and his administration have touted that the tariff plan will encourage business in the U.S. as industries set up shop on American soil to avoid tariffs, opening up job opportunities for U.S. workers.

White House trade advisor Peter Navarro previewed during a ""Fox News Sunday"" interview over the weekend that the new tariffs will generate $600 billion annually for the U.S. — or $6 trillion during the next decade.
While details of the plan remain shrouded in mystery until Trump's announcement, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent previously singled out 15% of the nations worldwide that havetrade imbalanceswith the U.S., referring to them as the ""dirty 15"" that will likely be the focus of the tariff announcement.
""Going into April 2, some of our worst trading partners in terms of the way they treat us have already come to President Trump offering... substantial decreases in very unfair tariffs,"" Bessent said Tuesday in an exclusive interviewon ""Mornings with Maria.""
""I'm optimistic that, April 2, some of the tariffs may not have to go on because a deal is pre-negotiated,"" he added, ""or that once countries receive their reciprocal tariff number, that, right after that, they will come to us and want to negotiate it down.""

The director of the National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett, also previewed that the administration was eyeing 10 countries to 15 countries for the tariff plan, but neither Bessent nor Hassett identified the countries by name.
Trump on Sunday, however, pushed back that the tariff plan would affect ""all countries,"" not just a scope of roughly a dozen.
""You’d start with all countries,"" Trump told reporters on Air Force One. ""So let’s see what happens. There are many countries.""
Trump added from the Oval Office on Monday that his administration will be ""nice"" to the foreign nations in comparison to how they have charged the U.S.

""We're being nicer than they were,"" he said while speaking to the media following signing an unrelated executive order Monday. ""We have a lot of countries, friend and foe.

The Trump administration is expected to roll out the ""External Revenue Service,"" which will oversee the tariff collection under the Commerce Department's leadership.
The highly anticipated trade announcement has sparked uncertainty about the cost of goods for Americans, with Leavitt reiterating Tuesday that Trump is focused on ""lowering inflation, lowering energy prices, (undertaking) massive deregulatory efforts, while simultaneously effectively implementing tariffs.""

Teddy Waszazak of Barre said in a House committee meeting last week that it is the government's job to make sure the right people win. (credit: Vermont House of Reps)
A Vermont lawmaker stood firm behind comments made during a recent Ways & Means hearing about the government’s role in the economy that drew the attention of state Republicans.
""Right now, our system is rigged against working people, our poorest neighbors, and the most vulnerable members of our communities,"" said state Rep. Teddy Waszazak, D-Barre. Fox News Digital asked him about comments made during a discussion on property tax brackets and proverbially paying one’s fair share.
""I feel very strongly about this — I feel the need to say this,"" Waszazak interjected during a committee discussion last week that included a guest witness from the business-centered Lake Champlain Chamber of Commerce organization.
""The market picks winners and losers — it is the job of the government and tax code to right-size that,"" Waszazak said.
VT GOP PUSHES FOR PENALTIES AGAINST DEMS ACCUSED OF DISRUPTING ‘DETRANS’ EVENT
The chamber official responded by saying that there may be a place for the government to ""play referee,"" but ""I don't think that it's appropriate to be picking winners and losers [or] targeting specific classes of payers based off of likes and dislikes… that’s a slippery slope.""
Another Democrat on the committee chimed in to say she did not believe Waszazak was seeking to divide taxation based on personal likes and dislikes.
Vermont Republicans seized on video clips of the hearing, with Vermont GOP Chairman Paul Dame saying such commentary is par for the course in Montpelier, as talk of government control and ""winners and losers"" is often associated with socialist political thought.
While Gov. Phil Scott is a Republican, the legislature has long been a site where far-left ideas are put to paper, Dame said.
""Unfortunately, Representative Waszazak is expressing verbally what so many Vermont Democrats believe and how they’ve legislated,"" he said.

""They believe it’s their job to tip the scales in the ways they see fit rather than letting Vermonters play on an equal playing field.""
In his comments to Fox News Digital, Waszazak reaffirmed his assertion from the hearing, saying that the ""rich are getting richer, and the poor are getting poorer.""
He pointed to the increasing wealth of billionaires Elon Musk,President Donald Trumpand Amazon/Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos.
Citing the discussion in the hearing, which revolved around funding affordable housing and divvying up Vermont breadwinners into as many as nine tax brackets, Waszazak said he would like to see a tax structure where the working-class benefits most.
""[I’d like to see] teachers, construction workers, food service workers, truck drivers, veterans, children, and families [be] the winners,"" he said. ""That's what I work for every day in Montpelier, and I’m proud of it.""
Fox News Digital also reached out to Sen.Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. — a self-described democratic socialist — for comment on his fellow Vermonter.

OnSanders' official website, a video featuring a then-21-year-old Waszazak showed the future lawmaker saying he believed the American Dream had faded.
""I think a lot of my generation is growing up and realizing that this isn’t the country and the economy that we were promised we were going to have. We were just told as children that if you work hard, if you go to school, you will eventually be able to buy a house, have kids, and have whatever job you want to have… And I don’t think that’s true at all today.""
On X, formerly Twitter, Waszazak appeared to be taking criticism in stride.
When a critic posted the video clip and asked ""is this a joke?"" the Democrat reposted: ""I’m Teddy Waszazak and I approve this message.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-research-reveals-how-ev-emissions-mandates-inflating-costs-gas-powered-cars-utilities,"New research reveals how EV, emissions mandates are inflating costs for gas-powered cars, utilities","‘The Big Weekend Show’ panelists discuss nationwide 'Tesla Takedown' protests against DOGE head Elon Musk.
FIRST ON FOX:Government subsidies forelectric vehicles (EVs),combined with a regulatory credit system for vehicle emissions, are leading to rising automobile and utility costs, a new report from the American Energy Institute (AEI) reveals.
Increasingly stringent Corporate Average Fuel Economy and greenhouse gas tailpipe emissions standards have forced gas-powered vehicle manufacturers to produce more EVs. As a result, this has siphoned auto manufacturers' resources away from gas-powered vehicle production and toward EV production, ultimately pushing the costs of gas-powered cars higher, according a report by the AEI.
If auto manufacturers do not produce enough EVs to meet state and federal standards, they are forced to buy into a credit system to offset their emissions production, inevitably creating another avenue where additional costs are transferred to consumers, according to the report.
GOP LAWMAKER SEEKS TO SLAM BRAKES ON BIDEN'S ‘WOKE AND WASTEFUL’ EV TAX CREDIT
Utility costs also see an impact, AEI's report points out. State and federal subsidy and rebate programs for EV charging infrastructure, while beneficial for utility companies' profits, lead once more to increased costs that are subsequently passed on to rate payers. Forty states offer rebates for in-home level two chargers, while at the federal level, rebate and subsidy programs for EV charging infrastructure received an investment of roughly $7.5 billion under formerPresident Joe Biden.
""By distorting the market with regulatory credits, subsidies, and behind-the-scenes rulemaking, federal agencies are shifting costs from affluent EV buyers to working-class Americans — while straining a grid that’s already under pressure,"" said Jason Isaac, co-author of the report and the founder and CEO of AEI. ""This isn’t about consumer choice or energy innovation. It’s administrative overreach that leaves Americans paying more to drive and to keep the lights on.""
Isaac, a formerTexas state representative, admitted that during his time in the legislature, he worked to create an EV subsidy in the Lone Star State, which provided all EV buyers with a $2,500 tax credit. He said that over time, he realized the majority of fully electric vehicles were being purchased by wealthier individuals who, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, would have done so even without the subsidies.
""This policy is not a home run,""saidHunt Allcott, a professor of environmental social sciences and a senior fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, with regard to the federal EV tax credit system. ""While the [Inflation Reduction Act's] electric vehicle tax credits have slowed climate change and shifted production to U.S. manufacturing firms, they also impose high costs on U.S. taxpayers.""
TOP AGENCY STAFFER TRYING TO BLOCK CRUCIAL TRUMP DIRECTIVE ONCE MANAGED DEI TEAM
Each EV that's purchased benefits from an estimated $94,000 to $153,000 in hidden subsidies over a 10-year period, according to research from the AEI. These figures account for the costsautomakersbear to meet government mandates as well as losses from forced EV production, expenses that ultimately raise prices for consumers.
A Tesla charges at an electric vehicle charging station in New York.
Rebates and subsidies for EV charging infrastructure are driving up base utility rates for consumers as well, the AEI report states. It is estimated that if each EV sold resulted in one in-home or commercial charging infrastructure, the more than 1.1 million EVs sold in 2023 would have received more than $827 million in residential charging tax credits.
Isaac said these rebates and subsidies are then used by utility companies to lobby public utility commissions to approve higher base rates because they are enhancing their infrastructure to improveEV infrastructure.
""When you go buy a gallon of gasoline, [taxpayers] are not helping you pay for that gallon of gasoline; all the costs are embedded within a gallon of gasoline,"" Isaac said. ""So the typical EV charge, whatever they pay at the charging station, is only a small portion of the expenses. That charging station itself has received a significant subsidy, both from the state and the federal government, and the utility has come in and increased the infrastructure or improved, enhanced the infrastructure to handle that load, and the rate payers in that particular area are picking up that burden.""
DEMOCRATS TURN ON TESLA DESPITE YEARS-LONG ELECTRIC VEHICLE PUSH
""Eliminating these costly EV mandates is exactly the kind of action needed under President Trump’s energy emergency,"" says American Energy Institute's Jason Isaac. ""It would jump-start a resurgence in the American auto industry, lower the price of new vehicles and ease pressure on our electric grid, bringing down energy costs for every household.""(AP/Getty/Fox)
One anecdote used in the report to illustrate the cost burden of EV charging subsidies and rebates posits that if one homeowner were to purchase anEV chargeron a street of 10 people, and the local electric company provides that homeowner with a $500 rebate, the downhill impacts lead to each of the 10 households shouldering a roughly $50 cost to build the charger as a result of the subsidized rate increases.
The increased costs on gas-powered car buyers and utility rate payers, Isaac said, illustrates the need to get rid of these clean-air mandates.

While he slammed Trump’s order to end collective bargaining for federal workers during aCBS interviewSunday, he heaped praise on the president at an appearance at a Detroit university.
""Yes, I disagree with Donald Trump on virtually everything, but [tariffs are] one thing I don’t disagree on,""Fain saidat Wayne State University, according to theDetroit Free Press.

Fain – who famously wore a shirt to a former Vice President Kamala Harris rally that read, ""Trump is a scab; vote Harris,"" and who Trump said should be fired during his convention speech – called the president the first in his lifetime to eliminate problematic trade deals like NAFTA.
""I’m not going to sit here now and say that since he’s a Republican or because he’s Donald Trump, I’m going to say, ‘screw you.’ That’s not how we do things. It’s having integrity,"" he said, according to the paper.
Fox News Digital reached out to Fain viathe UAWfor further comment.
Trump instituted 25% tariffs on outsourced cars and auto parts last week, which is primed to hit domestic brands like Chevrolet – which now produces vehicles in Mexico like the popular Equinox, and shuttered its major Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant in 2020.
Other manufacturers like Mack Trucks still make their vehicles in the U.S., with the Bulldog-branded manufacturing rigs at their longtime main plant in Macungie, Pennsylvania, and their powertrain facility in Hagerstown, Maryland.

While Fain reportedly said automakers cannot essentially wave a wand and reboot domestic production, he also said there is no reason U.S. automakers need to raise prices to withstand the financial hit. He called out ""corporate greed"" in that regard while adding Dodge had produced its Ram trucks in Warren, Michigan, for decades and does not need to suddenly move Ram ""overflow"" south of the border either.
""In fairness to the companies, they can’t just close a factory and open a brand new factory overnight… But there are a lot of opportunities right now."" Fain alleged automakers used the COVID-19 price spike to ""price-gouge"" up to 40% ""for no reason.""
""They’ve made massive profits for a decade, and all they see here is an opportunity… it’s a choice.""
""They could shift that work back to Warren tomorrow and produce trucks there. Those are the things that can happen immediately.""
A White House spokesman said the administration welcomes Fain on board when it comes to tariffs.
""We’re glad that UAW leadership has finally recognized what’s long been clear to UAW members: President Trump backs America’s blue-collar workers, and America’s blue-collar workers back President Trump,"" said spokesman Kush Desai.

When asked about potential price hikes and cases of U.S. automakers making vehicles abroad that could be hurt by said tariffs, Desai said ""iconic automakers like Stellantis and Hyundai have already responded to President Trump’s America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, tax cuts, and the unleashing of American energy with tens of billions in historic Made-In-America investment commitments.""
Desai added that Trump’s push for Americans to be able to deduct taxes on U.S.-made cars will drive the onshoring of manufacturing and job growth without systemic inflation.
""Just as President Trump’s policies did during his first term,"" he said.

PresidentDonald Trump's11th week in office is slated to focus heavily on tariffs, including the roll-out of the president's promised ""Liberation Day,"" when his reciprocal tariffs will be announced.
""Liberation Day, I call it Liberation Day in America,"" Trump said from the White House last week, previewing April 2.""You'll be seeing tariffs. And I think I've been very fair. I have them set. But I think I've been very fair to countries that have really abused us economically for many, many decades.""
For weeks, April 2 has been touted as the day when Trump'strade policy emphasizing""America First"" will be laid out in earnest and end the U.S.' reliance on goods made overseas. He is expected to roll out his reciprocal tariff plan on Wednesday, which will likely match other countries' higher tariff rates and aims to counter other trade barriers like burdensome regulations, value-added taxes, government subsidies and exchange rate policies and to negotiate with some countries to reduce those barriers.
""For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social of April 2 earlier in March.
HERE’S WHAT HAPPENED DURING TRUMP’S 10TH WEEK IN OFFICE
The tariffs on Wednesday follow Trump already leveling a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, 25% tariffs on goods imported from Canada and Mexico, and a 20% tariff on goods from China.
Another 25% tariff on all cars imported into the U.S. will also take effect late Wednesday of this week.

Trump is also expected to hold another conversation withRussian President Vladimir Putinthis week after the two world leaders also spoke last week as Trump and his administration continue working to help hash out a peace agreement between Russia and Ukraine amid the ongoing war.
On Sunday, however, Trump told NBC News that he is ""pissed off"" with Putin after the Russian president slammed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's leadership last week. Russia also carried out a series of attacks on Ukraine over the weekend amid ongoing talks to reach a potential peace agreement.

""That would be that if you buy oil from Russia, you can’t do business in the United States,"" he continued. ""There will be a 25% tariff on all oil, a 25- to 50-point tariff on all oil.""
Trump added that his anger will ""dissipate quickly"" if Putin ""does the right thing.""

This week, Trump is also expected to assess options for his ""Golden Dome"" missile-defense project, according to Defense One. Trump signed an executive order in January to build a ""a next-generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks."" Trump dubbed the system the ""Golden Dome"" earlier this month, which is a play on Israel's air defense system, called the ""Iron Dome.""

Trump's 11th week in office follows a break-neck pace of executive orders and actions since Jan. 20. Trump has signed at least 106 executive orders alone, which surpasses the number of executive orders signed by his predecessors in their respective first years in office since the Carter administration.

Darin Gaub joins ‘The Faulkner Focus’ to discuss the Trump administration accidentally including a reporter on a Signal group chat discussing Yemen strikes.
Good people across the country areangry at Washington– and for good reason.
From North Carolina and Nebraska to Washington and Georgia, people of all political backgrounds are demanding an explanation for the chaos created and the damage caused in just the first two months of the secondDonald Trumppresidency. They are decrying Elon Musk’s dismantling of government programs and agencies, and fearful about the Administration’s efforts to undermine our Constitution.
And they are outraged at the amateurish incompetence of many of Trump’s closet advisors, as exemplified in the clumsy, dangerous sharing of war plans on an unsecured Signal chat chain that was not only an embarrassment for our intelligence and defense apparatus, but also a serious threat to our security.

At home,families are strugglingwith rising prices directly caused by Trump’s on-again, off-again tariffs, many levied against our closest allies. The whiplash of the president’s daily deluge of chaos has killed job growth, with layoffs increasing245% in February alone – levels not seen since the Great Recession.

The country is facing dual measles and bird flu outbreaks that threaten the lives of children and livelihoods of farmers as vaccine-denying crockpot Robert F. Kennedy Jr. dismantles public health.
Meanwhile, thousands of veterans have lost their jobs as Musk arbitrarily hacks away at the federal workforce – nearly one-third of whom are veterans.
Furthermore,Musk’s plan to lay off80,000 Department of Veterans Affairs employees would disrupt critical services like the Veterans Crisis Line, compensation for disabilities, and cancer treatments for veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.
As the costs of Trump’s chaos economy become increasingly clear, Americans are looking to congressional Democrats to fight for them. They want us to defend the balance and powers established in our Constitution, to uphold the rule of law, and, importantly, to offer an alternative vision for a better path forward.
THE FUTURE OF NATURE IS NONPARTISAN. LET'S COMBAT ENVIRONMENTAL EXTREMISM WITH COMMON SENSE
That is exactly what the New Democrat Coalition – a group of 115 pragmatic, center-left House Democrats dedicated to finding commonsense solutions – is offering. As a growing majority in the House Democratic Caucus, New Dems are prepared to lead from the center with strong voices and bold policy ideas. We are championing a unity agenda for our party and the country that can rally Americans across the political spectrum.
What does this mean in practice? Our vision for the path forward is grounded on three pillars: economic growth and lowering costs, healthy and safe communities, andstrong national securityand defense.
First, New Dems are working to create an abundance of new, well-paying jobs, to raise the nation’s standard of living, and to help Americans achieve financial freedom – not just to make ends meet, but to get ahead. Working families should be able to comfortably afford a nice home. Students should be able to get an education without taking on mountains of debt. And everyone should be able to plan for a secure and dignified retirement.

Second, we are committed to ensuring people feel safe and secure in their homes and on their way to work, school and play.New Dems are workingto protect communities from crime and violence while ensuring every American has access to clean air and water, affordable housing, education and more.
Finally, we are determined to finally fix our broken immigration system and secure our borders. We are working to modernize our defense, diplomatic and development capabilities to advance American interests at home and abroad. And we are actively responding to a rapidly changing climate by improving the resiliency of critical infrastructure and investing in the clean energies of the future.
The 2024 election was about lowering costs and helping people get ahead, securing our border and protecting our communities, and strengthening our national defense and Americans’ security. People want a government that listens to them, understands their needs and priorities, clears barriers, and opens pathways to opportunity. That’s the vision of the New Dems.

Our nation is at a critical crossroads, and New Dems are steeled for a long fight. We will not shy away from confronting the president andcongressional Republicansto defend our values and protect our democracy. Nor will we hesitate to work together for the good of the nation.

Housing and Urban DevelopmentSecretary Scott Turner is reinvigorating the private sector's role in aiding economically distressed areas that have been neglected for decades – including touring areas of Philadelphia that have seen massive development since he served in the first Trump administration.
""The last five years have brought $84 billion of private investment. One million people have gotten lifted off the poverty rolls. Home values and Opportunity Zones have risen, while rents did not go up. And so the Opportunity Zones initiative is not only about economic development, but it's about community development. Families are able to build brand-new foundations for their lives,"" Turner told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interviewfrom Philadelphia.
Turner traveled to the City of Brotherly Love on Thursday to meet with local community and business leaders to discuss and tour recently revitalized areas of the city and Opportunity Zone projects, which are defined as economically distressed areas across the nation that incentivize investment and economic development through federal tax benefits to investors. Opportunity Zones were created under the first Trump administration through the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
Turner served as the executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during the first Trump administration, as well as led the Opportunity Zones Initiative.

Now that Turner is serving as the secretary of HUD in the second Trump administration, he previewed his excitement over ""Opportunity Zones 2.0"" that will make the program ""even better than before.""
""I'm very excited about the extension, the continuation of Opportunity Zones. And Opportunity Zones 2.0, if you will, and my estimation will be even better. So I'm looking forward to working with Sen. Tim Scott, Congress, the White House, and our private partners to make this even better than before,"" he said.
Turner spent Thursday meeting with local leaders at the Philadelphia Housing Authority, before touring a grocery store built in a North Philadelphia neighborhood, Sharswood-Blumberg, that has historically been rocked by crime and economic struggles.
The grocery store, called Grocery Outlet, is part of a mixed-use development project that came about after HUD announced a $30 million Choice Neighborhoods Grant in 2020 that attracted an additional $517 million in private and public investments. The development includes a community center that houses the Philadelphia Housing Authority, a health clinic and additional housing.

Turner also toured a newly completed building in Philadelphia's Fishtown neighborhood, called The Battery, which is an Opportunity Zone Development that has provided nearly 200 apartment units nestled along the Delaware River with views of Philadelphia's skyline. The building is also home to a luxury boutique hotel called Riversuites at The Battery.

The building previously served as a power plant that was built just after World War I, before it was shuttered and sat vacant for decades with no hope of revitalization due to its lofty costs and work to rehab, according to investors and local development leaders who joined Turner on his tour of the building. The building's prospects turned around in 2020, as the area's Opportunity Zone designation and tax incentives to preserve historic properties attracted $154 million in investments.

Now, the building showcases modern living spaces, while preserving its turn-of-the-century architecture in an area of Philadelphia that had previously been neglected for housing and economic opportunities.
""I'm very excited. We're here at the Battery in Philadelphia, which is an Opportunity Zone project. It's a mixed-use development. This is an old factory that they repurposed this building to bring mixed-use, economic development and community development using the Opportunity Zone initiative. I'm so excited to see,"" Turner told Fox News Digital from The Battery's rooftop, which boasts the energy plant's old smokestacks that have been transformed into private terraces.

""There's living space here. There's commercial space here. And people in this area now can utilize this… 50 years this place was dilapidated and closed. And now, through the investment of Opportunity Zones… this is a thriving place that Philadelphians can once use again,"" he added.

Turner explained to Fox Digital that developments in Opportunity Zones impact families and entire communities, while also rallying economic opportunities for private investors.
""Philadelphia has done a great job as it pertains to Opportunity Zones… And I would say, and I will say, there's a lot of excitement from our private development people, and partners around the country about the extenuation of Opportunity Zones. Families are impacted. We're mission-minded at HUD. It's economic development, it's community development. Our mission is to be a blessing to the people that we serve. Having public-private partnerships allows us and helps us to do this for the people of America, and Opportunity Zones is a major factor in that,"" he said.

Philadelphia has been rocked by crime, fentanyl addiction andhomelessness in recent years, which were three issues that spiraled nationwide amid and following the coronavirus pandemic. Turner highlighted to Fox News Digital that ""government is not the answer"" to issues related to America's housing crisis, homelessness, drug addiction and crime, but instead must operate as a ""partner"" to the private sector, faith-based programs and nonprofits.
""Homelessness is a big deal in our country,"" he said. ""It went up 18% in the last year – over 770,000 people on one single night in January of 2024 were homeless, and that's unacceptable. With record funding coming from HUD, we still have a homelessness crisis in our country.""

The federal government is not the answer. The federal government is a great partner, a great facilitator. But it's the private sector, it's faith-based, it's the nonprofits that really have their hands to the plow and their feet on the ground, that are doing the everyday work.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/eu-tariff-threats-crushing-craft-whiskey-distillers-like-me,EU tariff threats are crushing craft whiskey distillers like me,"United Refining Company Chairman John Catsimatidis joins ‘Fox & Friends’ to discuss the impact President Donald Trump’s latest tariffs on countries buying oil and gas from Venezuela could have on global trade.
America’s proud history as one of theworld’s top whiskey-producing nationsis in grave danger from the trade war between the U.S. and European Union. If it wasn’t enough for Canada to rip our products off shelves, the EU’s threat of 50% tariffs on American whiskey, set to take effect on April 13, now jeopardizes decades of progress and market expansion in Europe.
President Donald Trump is right:We must trade with the worldin a fair and reciprocal manner. That’s a model that has served the spirits industry well for decades. Small whiskey distillers like me are now counting on the president to strike a deal to ensure zero-for-zero tariffs on American whiskey, starting with the EU.
Much is at stake, including jobs,local agriculture and centuries of progress and pride in our craft. So ingrained is whiskey in American history that George Washington himself became a major distiller of rye whiskey after his presidency. But never has our legacy as a nation of distillers been as robust as it is today.
STOCKS RISE AFTER TRUMP TEASES 'NICER' TARIFF POLICY
In the past 20 years, an explosion of distilleries nationwide — from 50 in 2005 to more than 3,000 today — has taken the variety and reputation of American whiskey to new heights, expanding this subtle art to small towns such as Swisher, Iowa, where I operate my family-owned craft distillery. From these communities, our distinctive products have earned an international fanbase.
Jeff Quint is founder and CEO of Cedar Ridge Distillery in Swisher, Iowa, and producer of Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon.
Chief among those distinctive products is bourbon, which by definition can be distilled in any state in America, not just Kentucky. American whiskeys, such as bourbon, were exported from 37 states in 2024. In recent years, bourbon has become a sensation in foreign countries, earning a place alongside other national categories like scotch (a distinctive product of Scotland) and tequila (a distinctive product of Mexico).
These international markets are essential for the growth of small distilleries. Here in the U.S., there is only so much bourbon we can sell. A 50% tariff on bourbon in the EU would hike prices sharply and curb demand just as it is taking off. Many American distilleries will be forced to stop exporting, which could lead to bourbon overcapacity in America.

I have experienced the sting of tariffs firsthand. In 2016, my craft distillery — Cedar Ridge — started the arduous but exciting process of establishing our brand in the EU. It takes three to five years to find foreign distribution partners, promote your brand and fight for shelf space in a new market before you see a dime of real profit.
We were devastated when, in 2018, just as we were getting our sea legs in Europe, the EU retaliated against U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs with a 25% tariff on American whiskey. Our business became collateral damage in a trade dispute that had nothing to do with us. The choice was either to raise our prices to cover the tariffs, eat the cost ourselves and take the loss, or pull out of the market entirely. We made the painful decision to pull out, as did many others.
At the time, the EU was the largest American whiskey export market. But between 2018 and 2021, our exports plunged 20%, from $552 million to $440 million. The EU suspended its tariffs in 2021, enabling exports to surge back even higher — to $699 million last year. But many small distilleries like mine stayed out of the market due to uncertainty over whether these tariffs would be reimposed.
That uncertainty is kryptonite for a small business. It leaves us paralyzed, unable to embark on a three-to-five-year investment journey when we know the rug could be pulled out at any moment. This hurts not just our family and our 65 employees, but the local Iowa farms we buy our grains from, the American manufacturers who make our barrels and bottles, and the other downstream industries that support us.

We’re counting on this administration to fight for us and restore certainty in our trade relationships, first with the EU before the April 13 deadline, and then in Canada and other crucial markets. There are also many markets where we do not have fair and reciprocal trade, and we hope that the Trump administration will open those doors for our great American products.
On the line is nothing less than America’s whiskey legacy — centuries old and aged to perfection.

On Wednesday,the House DOGE subcommitteeheld a hearing to hold ""public"" broadcasting accountable for not serving the entire public that helps pay their bills. Under a barrage of Republican questions, NPR CEO Katherine Maher admitted it was a ""mistake"" for NPR to dismiss the Hunter Biden laptop story, expressed regret about vicious anti-Trump tweets before she came to NPR, and agreed it wouid be disturbing if reports were true that there were no Republicans in NPR newsroom.
How much coverage did this rock’em-sock’em hearing receive on ABC, CBS, and NBC? Nothing. Zero.Not on the evening news.Not on the morning programs the day after.
It’s not like thebroadcast networks weren’t covering hearings.They all led their newscasts with ""Signalgate,"" the Trump administration discussing a military strike on the Houthis on the private encrypted app Signal, but letting in leftist journalist Jeffrey Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic. Goldberg is the host of the weekly PBS show ""Washington Week with the Atlantic.""
NPR, PBS HONCHOS FACE TENSE GRILLING BY GOP LAWMAKERS OVER BIASED COVERAGE, TAXPAYER FUNDING
Both ABC’s ""World News Tonight"" and the ""NBC Nightly News"" ran footage of CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard being grilled by Democrats in a House hearing about how this breach happened. ""Bombshell text"" was the hype from NBC anchor Lester Holt’s opening of the broadcast.

On the ""CBS Evening News,"" reporter Ed O’Keefe was gunning for resignations: ""Well, here at the White House tonight, officials cannot rule out that someone might lose their job over all of this."" He interviewed Goldberg and former Obama Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to play up the scandal.
O’Keefe ended by noting the bipartisan call from the Senate Armed Services Committee for a full investigation: ""Roger Wicker, the Republican chairman from Mississippi, called it a successful attack on the Houthis but ‘a shame this security question is distracting the public from the success of that mission.’""
It’s a ""shame,"" all right. The networks will always downplay any Trump success and play up any Trump mistake.
So let’s explore the news from the PBS-NPR hearing they didn’t want to report:
1. NPR CEO Katharine Maher made a very belated admission to GOP questions about their harsh dismissal of the Hunter Biden laptop story as a ""pure distraction"" right before the 2020 election: ""Our current editorial leadership thinks that was a mistake, as do I."" This was breaking news, because no one heard them admit that before now, when their taxpayer cash is on the line.
2. Maher confessed that she would not send the same wild tweets she put out calling Trump a ""deranged racist sociopath"" and saying America was ""addicted to white supremacy."" She called looting ""counterproductive,"" but it’s ""hard to be mad"" about property crimes. She claimed she has ""evolved"" from these views. But these hot takes neatly match NPR’s wokeness. They probably helped her get the gig.
3. Both President and CEO of PBS Paula Kerger and Maher proclaimed against all the evidence that PBS and NPR news programs are nonpartisan and unbiased. Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon cited NewsBusters studies, like one that found the ""News Hour"" used 162 labels of ""far-right"" extremism and only six uses of ‘far left"" terms. Another one found PBS coverage of the 2024 party conventions was dramatically biased – the Republican confab drew 72 percent negative coverage, while the Democrat event drew 88 percent positive coverage. Kerger professed she had no idea about these studies. So much for preparing for the hearing.

4. Several Republicans cited the expose of NPR senior editor Uri Berliner, who found in research on the D.C. voter registrations of NPR newsroom employees that there were 87 Democrats and zero Republicans. Maher replied that would be disturbing if it were true, but in a year on the job, there’s no sign that they've hired any Republicans who could affect the daily leftist intensity of the NPR ""news."" Berliner was not a Republican, and he was forced out.
Maher confessed that she would not send the same wild tweets she put out calling Trump a ""deranged racist sociopath"" and saying America was ""addicted to white supremacy.""
5. Four Republicans noted Berliner’s finding that Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff was interviewed 25 times on NPR during the Russian-collusion fake news [I’d add here that Wolfson and Rutz found 32, but that’s your call.] Rep. Fallon noted that and asked Maher how many times the Republican chairman of the Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer, had been interviewed about his Biden impeachment probe. Maher didn’t know. Fallon told her it was zero. There’s a similar lack of attention to Comer from the network Sunday shows.
Hearing bias has been a constant exhibit in broadcast-news bias going back 50 years. They went wall-to-wall for the Democrats on Watergate, Iran-Contra, Anita Hill, and the extremely one-sided House January 6 Committee. Hearings chaired by Republicans are buried as worthless partisan exercises.

PBS and NPR felt compelled to cover this DOGE hearing, but that doesn’t mean they liked it. NPR media reporter David Folkenflik lamented it this way: ""The hearing, entitled ‘Anti-American Airwaves: Holding the Heads of NPR and PBS Accountable,’ appears arranged more to score points than to find facts.""
The broadcast news networks are easily accused of being more interested in scoring points than finding facts. They typically skip all the facts that ruin their ""storytelling"" – especially facts about how they skew the news.

""It is going to discourage those taxpayers from even filing, so it really does put them between a rock and a hard place,"" Adam Brewer, a federal tax expert who works for AB Tax Law, told Fox News Digital.
The comments come as the IRS and ICE are nearing a deal that would allow ICE to submit the names and addresses of illegal immigrants to the IRS, who could then cross-check thoseimmigrants' tax recordsand provide the immigration agency with current address information.
ICE NEARING HISTORIC DEAL WITH IRS TO AID IN DEPORTATIONS: REPORT

But some longtime IRS employees have expressed concerns about the deal, arguing that the tax agency has long assured the safeguarding of records in exchange for illegal immigrants filing tax returns, something they are required to do by law even though they are not in the country legally.
The draft agreement between the IRS and ICE would authorize verification ""subject to criminal investigation"" for violating immigration law, stretching the definition of a narrow IRS privacy exemption that allows the use of taxpayer data in the case of criminal investigations.
The deal comes as PresidentDonald Trumphas continued to increase efforts to speed up deportations, following through on one of the key promises he set on the campaign trail.
According to Brewer, stretching the definition of criminal investigations to those who entered the country illegally would be an ""unprecedented"" step for the IRS.

""For the IRS to get involved in criminal investigations, that's not uncommon,"" Brewer said. ""They have done a lot of information sharing, historically, with DEA to crack down on drug proceeds, those types of things. I guess the way I'm looking at it is, if illegal immigration itself is the crime, if you look at it through that scope, then yes, it's pretty unprecedented.""
'This feels like a deviation from what we've known for years … that if you share information with the IRS, it stops there,"" he added.
Brewer believes that the agreement could also damage the credibility of the IRS, which has built trust by strictly adhering to privacy regulations.
""That would be true of any government agency if they had said, ‘Hey, the DMV is going to start turning over your address to ICE.’ You're going to get less people who register their vehicles or who renew their driver's license. That's just the reality,"" Brewer said.
Brewer noted that a lot of illegal immigrants depend on filing theirtax returnsas a way to help gain their legal status, but the potential for deportation if their records are shared could dissuade them from going through the process.

""The IRS knows and ICE knows that these tax returns are required, and now they've really put a big disincentive in front of taxpayers from filing,"" Brewer said.
But Brewer also acknowledged that in some cases the information the IRS provides could prove to be a critical missing link for immigration authorities, pointing out that the IRS has long assisted other law enforcement agencies on other criminal matters.
""If someone just filed a tax return last month for 2024, that address information would be more recent or more likely to be accurate than some immigration document they filed last year,"" Brewer said. ""If we have the information in one department, you don't want ICE spending a ton of time and resources trying to track someone down … just for efficiency’s sake, we do want government agencies sharing information.""

Self-described ""MAGA leftist"" journalist and author Batya Ungar-Sargon is predicting PresidentDonald Trump'stariff war will result in major wins for the United States, especially for the American working class.
According to Ungar-Sargon, the debate over tariffs traces back to the fallout from NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) implemented in 1994 and the decades-long off-shoring of manufacturing to China.
""We basically took all of these good middle-class jobs and shipped them overseas to build up China and Mexico's middle class, and it resulted in the decimation of the Rust Belt, the decimation of working-class communities, deaths of despair, the whole fentanyl crisis,"" Ungar-Sargon toldFox News Digitalin an interview.
""I mean, all of this stuff stems from the degradation of masculinity and men as providers and as you know, in these factories, which were the center of their communities. I mean, the downstream effects of that, the atomization of Americans, is horrible.""

Ungar-Sargon had a spirited debate earlier this month with ""Real Time"" hostBill Maher, who was perplexed by the Trump administration's efforts to bring back manufacturing jobs, insisting ""that ship has sailed.""
""That ship has not sailed,"" Ungar-Sargon said in the interview. ""All of that manufacturing is still being done. It's just being done in other countries and building up their middle class.""
""And President Trump is the first person in, you know, 40 years, 30 years to say, 'Well, why don't we- we all know what the problem is- why don't we try and fix it?"" she continued.
MAHER ASKS ‘WHY DO WE WANT TO BRING BACK MANUFACTURING’ AS TRUMP MAKES JOBS ARGUMENT IN TARIFF WAR
The Free Press columnist Batya Ungar-Sargon clashed with HBO's Bill Maher about whether President Trump's tariff war will bring back manufacturing jobs to the U.S.(Screenshots/HBO)
The ""Second Class"" author pointed to the early results of Trump's tariff strategy like the trillion dollars in investments being made by various manufacturers in recent weeks, as well as pushing Mexico and Canada to crack down on border crossings and policing the transfer of fentanyl.
""It's going to stop this, what has been our economy for the last 50 years, which was an upward funnel of wealth from the pockets of working-class Americans into the pockets of the elites,"" Ungar-Sargon said. ""What he wants to do is make working-class labor once again competitive, both domestically and in the global marketplace, and it's just a great mechanism for it.""

She conceded that the tariffs were being rolled out ""a little bit chaotically,"" saying that element of Trump's strategy is ""not great,"" but stressed the long-term impact will be ""absolutely huge.""
""Trump can't stand when the U.S. is treated like a patsy. And that's basically what we have. We have a whole bunch of countries that have massive tariffs on us, and we don't have tariffs on them. It's just not fair, and it's not right. And it is disrespectful to our working class,"" Ungar-Sargon said. ""And I think Trump is trying to bring back, not just respect and dignity to the working class, but the romance of the American working class in order to reverse this trend of men justdropping out of the workforce, dropping out of life, not being able to get married and start families and, you know, all of that great stuff.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/deep-red-state-makes-major-announcement-about-income-tax,Deep red state makes major announcement about income tax: 'We plant our flag',"‘America Reports’ panelists Meghan Hays and David Avella discuss Democrats' ongoing criticism of DOGE cuts.
FIRST ON FOX:Mississippi taxpayerswill get significant relief with the incremental elimination of the state's income tax.
Republican Gov. Tate Reeves is signing legislation into law Thursday evening that will lower that tax from 4.7% to nothing over the next few years, including getting it down to 3% by 2030, then eventually down to zero.
House Bill 1, the ""Build Up Mississippi Act,"" also slashes thegrocery taxto 5% from 7%.

""I am proud to sign into law a complete elimination of the individual income tax in the state of Mississippi,"" Reeves said in a statement.
""Let me say that again: Mississippi will no longer tax the work, the earnings or the ambition of its people. The legislation I’m signing today puts us in a rare class of elite, competitive states. There are only a handful of states in the country that do not tax income. Today, Mississippi joins their ranks, and, in doing so, we plant our flag.""
Proponents of the legislation believe it will help boost economic development in the state. Only nine states do not charge anindividual income tax: Tennessee, Florida, South Dakota, New Hampshire, Nevada, Wyoming, Alaska, Washington, and Texas.

""This is more than a policy victory. This is a transformation. And it’s a transformation that I have believed in, fought for and worked toward for many years,"" the governor stated.
""Generations from now, when our kids are raising families of their own in a stronger, more prosperous Mississippi, they will look back on this moment and say, ‘This is when we took our shot.’ To the people of Mississippi, you are the real winners today.""

The state legislature had disagreements on how to best approach tax policy, and a typo considered a happy accident by proponents paved the way for a faster schedule on how soon the cuts can be made, according to theClarion Ledger. The outlet reported that some Democrats are opposed to the legislation, citing potential concerns about its effect on the public sector.
The new policy comes as major tax changes are being proposed at the federal level. TheTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017expires this year, and President Donald Trump has pledged to extend it. He is also hoping to make good on a promise to scrap the federal income tax on tipped wages and overtime pay.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/brother-in-law-top-dem-senator-played-key-role-recruiting-chinese-firms-deep-blue-city,Brother-in-law of top Dem senator played key role in recruiting Chinese firms to deep blue city,"Heritage Foundation senior fellow on China Michael Pillsbury evaluates foreign policy relations between the United States and China on ‘Fox Report.’
FIRST ON FOX:The brother-in-law of a topDemocratic senatorhas repeatedly hosted diplomats working on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) at his office and recruited multiple Chinese businesses to lease office space as part of his family’s sprawling real estate empire, a Fox News Digital review found.
Anthony ""Tony"" Malkin is the Harvard-educated brother-in-law of Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and the chairman and CEO of Empire State Realty Trust, Inc., which includes nearly 600 tenants and 732 residential units. He has hosted multiple consuls general of the People's Republic of China inNew Yorkdating back over 15 years and reportedly traveled to China to recruit companies to lease office space in New York City.
In 2011, Chinese state media outlet China Dailypublished a profile pieceon Chinese companies helping boost office rentals overseas in the United States. Malkin, the brother of Sen. Blumenthal’s wife, Cynthia, was featured in the profile that noted how he ""recently visited China to find tenants, hoping to benefit from the previous flood of Chinese buyers of commercial housing who are now spilling into the office rental market.""
The profile piece continued by highlighting how Malkin ""secured leases"" with multiple Chinese companies, including state-owned Air China LTD, Hong-Kong-based telecommunications company PCCW-HKT DataCom Services Ltd, and People's Daily Online, which is controlled by People’s Daily, the Chinese propaganda network directly run by the CCP’s Central Committee, according to theChina Media Project.

The China Media Project went on to highlight how People's Daily Online ""runs the Chinese Communist Party News Network"" and requires applicantsapplying for jobsto ""[love] the party,"" which refers to the CCP.
""People's Daily Online left its space at the Empire State Building nearly a decade ago,"" an Empire State Realty Trust (ESRT) spokesperson told Fox News Digital about the former tenant's lease. ""Air China, which is defined as a publicly traded company that is partially owned by the Chinese government, has an office at the Empire State Building, but is only about 3,000 square feet in the 7.8 million square feet of our office portfolio.""
However, a multinational Hong Kong-based group called Li & Fung Ltd, whose chairman has multiple CCP ties, reportedly rented the largest office space from Malkin, according to the 2011 China Daily article. While Li & Fung no longer has the largest office space, it is still currently a tenant of the ESRT, according to financial data reviewed by Fox News Digital. A 2024 ESRT report lists the Chinese company occupying over 149,000 square feet, having multiple leases ending in October 2028 and an annual rent of over $8.3 million.
A Fox News Digital review found that Victor Fung, who has played an instrumental leadership role for several years with the company that his grandfather founded, was alongtime memberof the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) between 2003 and 2018 and is currently serving as a vice chairman of the China-United States Exchange Foundation (CUSEF). He was also reportedly one of the business executives whomet with Chinese President Xi Jinpinglast year to lay out his vision for Hong Kong becoming a supply chain center for Chinese businesses.
The CPPCC is the ""key mechanism for multi-party cooperation and political consultation"" under the leadership of the CCP, according to the CPPCC website. CUSEF is the CCP front group founded by Tung Chee-hwa, who served as a vice chair of the CPPCC and has colluded with U.S. leaders to gain influence. Fox News Digitalpreviously exposedhow Julia Wilson, a Black public relations consultant, was paid over $1 million by Chee-hwa's CUSEF to help the Chinese government learn about Black Americans and gain influence with Black universities and leaders.

In addition to securing these leases, Malkin reportedly launched a ""China business desk"" in an attempt to keep up with the demand of Chinese businesses and was ""cooperating with Chinese tour groups,"" which was seen as a lucrative business opportunity. However, an ESRT spokesperson pushed back and claimed, ""Mr. Malkin had never seen this 2011 article"" and added that the quote in the story ""is not part of any attributed quote, and not something Mr. Malkin or Malkin Holdings ever did.""
The ESRT spokesperson continued by pointing out that China was a ""large growth market"" in 2011 for inbound tourism and that Malkin's business trip to China revolved around that, adding, ""On behalf of our stakeholders, ESRT will always from around the world solicit tenants and tourists.""
The China National Tourism Office of New York, which was under the control of China National Tourism Administration, a state-owned travel agency that had overseas offices in several countries and was previously in coordination with the CCP’s chief administrative State Council authority, used to be located in the Empire State Building in the early 2000s until it appeared to have moved locations in 2009. Malkin was the president of Malkin Holdings LLC, the predecessor to Empire State Realty Trust's REIT, when this office was operating in the Empire State Building.
'WARM HOSPITALITY': UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT HAS REPEATEDLY COZIED UP TO TOP CCP OFFICIALS
Sen. Blumenthal's office told Fox News Digital that the Connecticut senator ""has absolutely nothing to do with any of this.""
""Senator Blumenthal’s wife is one of literally thousands of shareholders in a publicly traded real estate company, and just like the rest of those shareholders, she doesn’t have control over anything this company does. Senator Blumenthal has absolutely nothing to do with any of this,"" Blumenthal spokesperson Maria McElwain said.
""Senator Blumenthal supports a ban on Members of Congress and their spouses as well as the Vice President and President from holding individual stocks,"" she continued. ""He also voted in favor of the STOCK Act, and supports more stringent measures to further eliminate conflicts of interest.""
In addition to Blumenthal’s brother-in-law leasing out rental space to Chinese companies, he has repeatedly given a major platform to multiple Chinese diplomats working in New York City on behalf of the Chinese government over the last 15-plus years.
In November, the newly-installed Chinese Consul General Chen Li, who was recently photographed posing with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and anti-Trump Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg,posted on his X accountthat he met with Malkin and looked forward to ""working with Tony to promote connections and friendship between our peoples!""

A couple of months later, Chenposted photosand a video of the Empire State Building and touted how ""NYC’s icon will Turn CHINESE RED for the 25th consecutive year TONIGHT!""
Chen, like his predecessor Huang Ping, has repeatedly praised the CCP and denied China’s alleged genocide against the Uyghur population, which has been condemned by many on the world stage, including the United Nations. Malkin also had a cozy relationship with Ping while he served as the Chinese consul general between 2018 and late 2024.
Michael Sobolik, an expert on U.S.-China relations and a Hudson Institute senior fellow, told Fox News Digital that the ""Chinese Communist Party is always looking for ways to penetrate U.S. businesses and civil society. We shouldn’t make their job easier for them.""
Ping’s exit from the position occurred shortly after he was referenced dozens of times in an unsealed indictment against Gov. Kathy Hochul’s former deputy chief of staff, Linda Sun, who was charged ""with violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling, and money laundering conspiracy,"" according to a Justice Department press release.

The indictment revealed then-Lt. Gov. Hochul wanted to mention the ""Uyghur situation"" in China for her 2021 Lunar New Year message, but the plight of the minority group being persecuted by the Chinese government was ultimately omitted after Sun overruled the speechwriter.
The indictment alleges Sun revealed to Ping what the speechwriter wanted to include, but insisted that she would not let her boss mention Uyghurs after admitting that she was ""starting to lose her temper"" with the speechwriter. The indictment later detailed other exchanges she had with Ping and said he gifted her parents with Nanjing-style salted ducks prepared by his chef in exchange for her help in influencing the governor's policies.
Fox News Digital pressed Blumenthal's office on whether the senator, who has been akey voice on Uyghur human rightsissues, was concerned about his brother-in-law recruiting Chinese businesses to New York and partnering with CCP diplomats who have denied Uyghur genocide. However, his spokesperson did not address this in the office's response.
When asked about Malkin's relationship with the Chinese consuls general, an ESRT spokesperson told Fox News Digital that ""Throughout its nearly 94-year history, the Empire State Building has partnered with countless government organizations, charities, and companies to celebrate important international celebrations and events.
CHINA'S US INFLUENCE COULD FACE CRACKDOWN UNDER SLATE OF NEW BILLS
""The Lunar New Year lighting of the Empire State Building, for example, has been celebrated for more than 15 years in partnership with the local Chinese consulate and local Chinese organizations, shops, bakeries, and teahouses,"" the spokesperson added.
Ping and Malkin have met several times, including an October 2021 virtual meeting that revolved around cooperation between the United States and China,according to a press releasefrom the Chinese Consulate General, which noted their relationship with the Empire State Building dates back to 2008.
""Malkin said the pandemic has dramatically changed the world and the U.S., which also highlights the significance of international cooperation to meet challenges. The enhancement of cultural exchanges really matters to the U.S.-China relations,"" the press release continued. ""Hope the two peoples can overcome obstacles and deepen mutual understanding by exchanges and communications. I am willing to keep on working closely with Mr. Consul General as well as the Chinese Consulate General in New York, contributing to the friendship between the two peoples.""

In 2023, the Chinese Consulateshared multiple photosof Ping and Malkin at the Empire State Building with the caption, ""Chinese Consulate General in NY and [Empire State Building] held a Chinese New Year Lighting Ceremony today, to celebrate the [Year of the Rabbit] CG Huang Ping and ESB Chairman Mr. Anthony Malkin attended the event and together lit up the building with Chinese Red.""
Malkin and Ping also met in 2019 to light up the Empire State Building in honor of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which wasamplified by Chinese state media.
Prior to Ping serving as the Chinese consul general, Malkin repeatedly met with then-Consul General Zhang Qiyue, who previously served in several top CCP positions, including the deputy director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 2017, Qiyue and Malkin smilinglyposed for a photoahead of the lighting of the Empire State Building to celebrate the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival. They also met in 2015 and 2016 to light up the Empire State Building to celebrate the Lunar New Year, a Fox News Digital review found.
Sun Guoxiang, who served as a consul general between 2011 and 2014 in New York and held multiple CCP titles, alsorepeatedly visitedthe Empire State Building. In a 2014 ESRT press release, the group said, ""To kick-off the festivities, Ambassador Sun Guoxiang, Consul General of the People’s Republic of China in New York, will preside over a lighting ceremony."" Jean-Yves Ghazi, who currently serves as the president of the ESRT Observatory TRS, L.L.C., appears to have been the ESRT executive who oversaw that lighting.

It was not too long ago that as part of the left’s climate change push, owning an electric vehicle (EV) was the pinnacle of virtue.To save the planet, there were EV mandates, EV tax credits and even targets for companies switching their manufacturing to EVs.
Tesla was a darling of this ""green"" movement. As the U.S.’s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles,owning a Teslawas a way to show you were on the right team.
But not anymore.

Tesla’s head honcho,Elon Musk, has gone from leftist darling to persona non grata in an instant.
TRUMP, ZELDIN BRING A KEY INGREDIENT TO AMERICA’S 'GREEN AGENDA'
As Musk has become entrenched with the current administration, helping PresidentDonald Trumpwith such ""horrible"" activities as identifying, waste, fraud and abuse, Musk’s social credit score has gone down. This has happened despite his work on fraud and abuse being the very same issues that many on the left have come out against for years.
So, the same virtue signaling scolds who screamed that you were killing the planet if you did not buy an electric vehicle are now targeting owners of those very same electric vehicles, going after the people they once praised for making a supposedly morally and societally ""superior"" choice.

Across the U.S., new stories keep popping up of Tesla drivers being harassed and even having their cars scratched or ""keyed,"" just for owning a Tesla EV. This doesn’t directly impact Elon – his company doesn’t own the cars once they are purchased – it only damages the property of someone who was, as they left would say, doing the right thing to save the planet.
LOWER GAS PRICES AREN’T LUCK. TRUMP’S ENERGY POLICIES ARE FUELING AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE
But it does create the threat that if you aren’t on the right team, you will be harassed, too, which can make people think twice about buying a new Tesla or keeping their existing one.
I guess the planet comes second to whatever thenew virtue signal is of the day, and today it’s that Elon is not on the ""correct"" team.
Worse, recent violent attacks against Tesla have included setting Tesla cars ablaze, releasing significant CO2 into the atmosphere, the exact behavior that we were told was quickly going to kill the planet.
THE FUTURE OF NATURE IS NONPARTISAN. LET'S COMBAT ENVIRONMENTAL EXTREMISM WITH COMMON SENSE
This exposes the climate scam for what it was. It was never about the planet; it was always about power and control.
Further pulling back that curtain is formervice presidential candidate Tim Walz, who also is rooting against America’s largest EV producer, a company that is a clear leader in ""saving the planet.""
In a speaking engagement, after Tesla stock’s recent selloff, Walz noted that he added Tesla to his iPhone’s stock app to give him ""a little boost during the day."" He continued, ""225 and dropping,"" to a round of applause, gleefully and actively signaling that he was rooting for Tesla’s failure. Screw the environment when there’s destruction to root for!

But Tesla is more than just a green company. It’s also one of the largest stocks in the world market capitalization. It is a widely held and substantial component of major stock indices, including the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite, meaning that many Americans have exposure to Tesla in their portfolios, directly or indirectly.
Rooting against Tesla is rooting against American jobs, American 401(k)s and American pension plans. In fact, Fox Newsreportedthat Tim Walz’s home state of Minnesota’s state employees' pension owns over one million Tesla shares.

You can never win with the virtue signalers because they have no actual moral compass; they just bend to whatever they believe will preserve their perceived societal status. And now, hardworking Americans who have been aligned withthe green agendaare being bullied as part of the new social statement du jour.
Many of us knew the climate directives were always about power and control, and now that act has been fully exposed.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) terminated some mortgages for illegal immigrants in an effort to ensure federalhome loansdon't go to those living in the U.S. illegally.
HUD Secretary Scott Turner announced the move Wednesday, a day after news of a joint effort with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to focus on homeownership for Americans.
""Today, HUD terminated Biden's taxpayer-backed FHA mortgages for illegal aliens,"" Turner wrote on X. ""American taxpayers will no longer subsidize open borders by offering home loans to those who enter our nation illegally.""

In another post, Turner said HUD-backed mortgages should benefit Americans ""who play by the rules and work hard, not those who enter our country illegally.""
""Today, HUD acted to protect the American Dream of homeownership,"" he wrote.
On Monday, Turner andDHS Secretary Kristi Noemsigned a memo to end ""wasteful misappropriation"" of taxpayer-funded public housing resources going to illegal immigrants rather than U.S. citizens.

""This new agreement will leverage resources, including technology and personnel, to ensure American people are the only priority when it comes to public housing.
""We will continue to work closely with DHS to maximize our resources and put American citizens first.""

Roughly 9 million people live in subsidized housing across the country, according to HUD. About 59% of noncitizen households — those including green card holders or illegal immigrants — use one or more public assistance programs, costing taxpayers as much as $42 billion annually, according to theCenter for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for lower immigration levels.
Upon taking office, PresidentDonald Trumpcalled for greater oversight to stop illegal immigrants from accessing taxpayer-funded resources.
During the Biden administration, tens of millions of dollars were spent on housing for migrants, including for all-expense-paid stays at hotels for some.

Our new website at Unleash Prosperity, calledVoteWithYourFeet.comchronicles the massive migration over the past 25 years of businesses, people and capital from the high-tax and heavy regulation zones ofthe northeastand the west coast, to the low-tax and light-regulation regions - the south and more recently to the mountain states like booming Idaho and Utah.
From 2020-23, the southeast gained a net 2.5 million more residents, while the northeast lost in net-migration from other states, almost exclusively people leaving the northeast, California and Illinois.
'TICKED OFF' TOM IZZO RANTS ABOUT NCAA TRANSFER PORTAL OPENING AS MICHIGAN STATE PREPARES FOR SWEET 16
This declining influence of the blue states is embarrassingly amplified by what is happening in college sports. The South has won 17 of the last 20 national championships with the Southeast Conference gaining most of those titles.
Now look at this year's ""sweet sixteen"" in the NCAA basketball tournament.  Amazingly, 15 of the 16 teams that have still survived the first two rounds of the tournament's first weekend of madness are located in states won by Donald J. Trump in November.

The survivors include Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Auburn, Brigham Young, Duke, Florida, Houston, Kentucky, Michigan, Michigan State, Mississippi, Purdue, Tennessee, Texas A&M and Texas Tech.  The only outlier was Maryland. Admittedly, Arizona, and Michigan are purple states but all the rest are ruled by Republicans and have a long history of low taxes.
2025 MEN’S MARCH MADNESS ODDS: TITLE CHANCES FOR SWEET 16 TEAMS
It wasn't that long ago that the college basketball champion trophy resided in Westwood, California -- with John Wooden's UCLA Bruins stampeding over opponents in the 1960s and early 1970s mostly with home-grown Golden State talent.  Then, in the mid-1980s, it was the rugged Big East with schools like Syracuse, Georgetown, St. Johns and Villanova bulldozing through the NCAA tournament with kids from New York City, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. In 1985 for the first and only time ever -- three of the Final Four teams were from the same conference: the Big East.  Now these teams have sunk into mediocrity.

Theone glaring exception is Connecticut, which won two straight national championships, but even this beast from the East failed to survive the opening weekend of the tournament.
The outlook for a blue state sports comeback anytime soon looks bleak.  According to Rivals, a top recruiting database, 28 of this year’s top 40 high school basketball prospects were located in red states, with Florida, Texas, Georgia andNorth Carolinaproducing the most gifted and talented athletes.
The regional disparity in football high school star recruits is even more pronounced.  Amazingly, 75 percent of the Top 40 high school football seniors are from red states.

Glenn Youngkin joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss President Donald Trump's decision to dismantle the Education Department and Randi Weingarten's conflicting remarks on school closures.
Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin is drawing comparisons to""The Godfather""after vetoing nearly 160 bills from the Democrat-controlled legislature on Wednesday.
""You could call him ‘Veto Corleone,’"" a Republican strategist told Fox News Digital in comments later Wednesday, after 159 bills were killed upon reaching Youngkin's desk.
Virginia’s General Assembly passed bills this session that would have prevented prayer in front of abortion clinics, required the commonwealth to implement a comprehensive ""environmental justice"" strategy and adjusted criminal bond policies.
All of those bills were vetoedby Youngkin, and the legislature’s Democratic majority is far from veto-proof — with two-seat margins in each chamber.
YOUNGKIN WALKS POLITICAL TIGHTROPE WITH SUPPORT FOR DOGE, MEGA-JOB FAIR
Other vetoed bills included two pertaining to gun control legislation, restricting the purchase or transfer of firearms and the like.
Ten of the bills were considered ""soft on crime"" legislation by critics, and about a dozen would have raised costs on Virginians, according to Republicans.
The governor also nixed a proposal to raise the state minimum wage to $13.50 per hour, and later to $15.
In a statement, Youngkin highlighted legislation supported by some in the Trump administration — such as a bill to keep school lunches free of artificial dyes, which he signed and which mirrors an initiative from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.

""I have completed my actions on the more than 900 bills sent to me during the 2025 legislative session,""Youngkin said.
""The legislation that I’ve signed into law and the budget amendments I’ve put forward this year will go a long way to helping ensure Virginia remains a great place to live, work, and raise a family.""
""I have returned many bills with recommended amendments, hoping that we can come together next week with a common purpose to advance these bills,"" he added.

Of his veto choices, Youngkin said those bills collectively would ""take the commonwealth backward by raising the cost of living, hurting our strong job growth, stifling innovation, undermining our All-American All-of-the-Above Power and Energy Plan or making our communities less safe.""
On X, observers contrasted Youngkin’s veto prowess with his predecessors.
The incumbent is one veto away from hitting 400, while Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat, only vetoed 18 bills in his four years as governor.
Fellow Republican Bob McDonnell vetoed a similar amount to Warner, while the nearest governor of the 21st century in veto usage was Democrat Terry McAuliffe, with more than 110 vetoes.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/removing-shackles-major-proposal-could-lower-gas-prices-this-state,'Removing the shackles': Major proposal could lower gas prices in this state,"'Making Money' host Charles Payne unpacks President Donald Trump's new investment in the U.S. on 'The Story.'
A legislativeproposal in Arizonahopes to lower gas prices amid a recent appeal to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin.
Currently, federal ozone attainment standards have prompted parts of the state, especially heavily populated Maricopa County, to use a ""boutique""blend of gasolinesince 1997, and it is the only place in the country that has done so.
The legislative proposal would make it state law for other types of gasoline blends to be used aside from the specific winter and summer blends currently allowed, as it would be what is available in other states.
LOWER GAS PRICES AREN’T LUCK. TRUMP’S ENERGY POLICIES ARE FUELING AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE

Gas prices in the Grand Canyon State are currently among the highest in the country at $3.33 per gallon on average on Tuesday, according to AAA. In Maricopa County, that average is roughly 20 cents higher.
""Modeling shows that 80% of the ozone in Maricopa County travels here from outside the state. This includes wildfires, pollution from Mexico, and emissions from California,"" President Pro Tempore T.J. Shope said in a statement. ""Even if 4 million gas burning cars were removed from our roads, Arizona would still not attain the impossible ozone standards set by the EPA.""
Similar legislation was worked on in the legislature last year, but the renewed push on the issue comes asSenate President Warren Petersenrecently met with Zeldin.
LIZ PEEK: TRUMP, ZELDIN BRING A KEY INGREDIENT TO AMERICA’S 'GREEN AGENDA'

""Following that meeting, Administrator Zeldin publicly raised our concerns about being punished for emissions outside of our control, and he committed to ensuring air quality will be protected while allowing us to grow the economy,"" Petersen said in a statement.
""HB 2300 is the first step in removing the shackles off Arizona and positions us to reduce gas prices quickly, in coordination with upcoming action from Administrator Zeldin on behalf of the Trump Administration. Providing multiple fuel options allows the market to compete during unexpected shortages and will help keep gas prices low for Arizona drivers.""
Some Democrats have argued the legislation would pose an environmental risk and ""does nothing to lower gas prices.""
""House Bill 2300 weakens Arizona's clean air protections by changing the rules for gasoline standards in certain areas. Here's why that's a problem: It could lead to more air pollution as this bill puts gas companies over public health,"" State Sen. Rosanna Gabaldón said in a statement after the bill passed out of committee.
""Current fuel standards help keep our air cleaner, especially in cities with high traffic. Loosening these rules could make pollution worse. It would allow for more loopholes for gas suppliers. Instead of sticking to proven fuel standards, the bill opens the door for changes that may not meet strict environmental guidelines,"" she continued.

On March 12, Zeldin released a statement saying that there have been various complaints nationwide about communities being penalized for air quality regulations they can do little about. If the bill were to be signed into law by Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs, the EPA would still need to clear those blends through the State Implementation Plan, whichZeldin’s office says there’s a ""backlog"" of.
""The Biden Administration’s focus on ideological pursuits instead of the agency’s core mission and statutory duties resulted in a delay in air quality improvement. With more than 140 million Americans living in nonattainment areas around the country, cooperative federalism and clearing out the State Implementation Plan backlog will make significant strides to improving the air we breathe,"" Zeldin said in a statement at the time.
The EPA did not respond in time for publication.
""We are still evaluating the legislation so nothing to share at the moment,"" a spokesperson for Hobbs' office told Fox News Digital.

For years, we’ve been told the future belongs to tech jobs, coding boot camps and college degrees that leave young Americans saddled with debt. But whileartificial intelligence is shaking upwhite-collar professions, there’s one sector AI won’t be replacing anytime soon: blue-collar skilled trades. Let’s face it, when your septic system blows up are you the one who is going to clean up the mess?
That’s right — while office workers worry aboutChatGPT taking their jobs,the demand for electricians, plumbers, welders, and mechanics is skyrocketing. Companies are desperate for skilled workers, wages are soaring, and many of these careers offer six-figure salaries without the need for a four-year degree.
If you’re looking for job security,financial success,and a career that actually makes America great again, this is the wake-up call for parents and kids across our great country.
WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES
For decades, parents, schools and politicians pushed the ""college or bust"" mentality, steering young Americans away from the trades. Have you taken AP courses? What’s your SAT score? Have you done your extracurricular activities? Meanwhile, Baby Boomers — who built this country’s infrastructure — are retiring in droves. The result? A massive labor shortage in blue-collar industries.
Human welders are needed in unpredictable environments — shipbuilding, infrastructure repairs and pipelines.(Getty Images)
Here’s what that means for anyone willing to pick up a wrench, climb a ladder, or remove a tree stump:
Here are some of the best careers in the trades in my view, why they’re in demand, and how much money you can make:
Why AI can’t replace them: Electrical systems are complex and vary by building. Diagnosing problems and working in unpredictable environments requires human expertise.
Earning potential:
Entry-level: $40,000 - $50,000
Experienced: $75,000 - $100,000+
Self-employed: $100,000 - $150,000+
Electrical systems are complex and vary by building. Diagnosing problems and working in unpredictable environments requires human expertise.(iStock)
Why AI can’t replace them: You can’t program a robot to crawl under a 50-year-old house and figure out why the pipes are leaking. Plumbing requires hands-on problem-solving.
Earning potential:
Entry-level: $45,000 - $55,000
Experienced: $80,000 - $100,000+
Self-Employed: $100,000 - $200,000+
Why AI can’t replace them: While robots can weld in factories, human welders are needed in unpredictable environments — shipbuilding, infrastructure repairs and pipelines.
Earning potential:
Entry-level: $40,000 - $50,000
Experienced: $75,000 - $100,000+
Specialized welders (Underwater/Aerospace): $150,000 - $300,000+
Why AI can’t replace them: Heating and cooling systems require hands-on installation and maintenance, often in tight spaces.
Earning potential:
Entry-level: $45,000 - $55,000
Experienced: $80,000 - $100,000+
Business Owners: $100,000 - $200,000+
Why AI can’t replace them: Autonomous construction vehicles are nowhere near ready to handle the unpredictable conditions of job sites. I own a concrete driveway company and try getting AI to pour a perfect driveway.
Earning potential:
Entry-level: $50,000 - $60,000
Experienced: $80,000 - $120,000+
Union Jobs: $100,000+ with benefits
AI can help diagnose a check engine light, but fixing a car or truck? That takes real skill and experience.(iStock)
Why AI can’t replace them: AI can help diagnose a check engine light, but fixing a car or truck? That takes real skill and experience. Whether you like Tesla or not, the gross hourly rates of mechanics are $210 an hour.
Earning potential:
Entry-level: $40,000 - $50,000
Experienced: $75,000 - $100,000+
Specialized Diesel/Performance Mechanics: $100,000 - $150,000+
Shortages drive up pay –Supply and demand 101: fewer workers means higher wages. Simple as that.
These jobs require hands-on skills –AI can’t install pipes, wire a house or weld a bridge. These careers aren’t going anywhere.
By 2030, the U.S. will be short over 2 million skilled trade workers. Companies are raising wages to attract workers. Often, hourly rates of electricians or plumbers can rival accountants.
You can be your own boss –Many trade professionals start their own businesses, setting their own schedules and earning well over six figures.
No student debt –Most of these careers require apprenticeships or trade schools, which cost a fraction of a four-year degree. You start working (and earning) years before your college-bound peers.

Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Scott Turner andHomeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noemhave forged a new inter-agency initiative aimed at ensuring federal housing funds do not go to illegal immigrants.
The two secretaries signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Monday cementing the partnership, which will serve to end what they call ""wasteful misappropriation"" of taxpayer-funded public housing resources going to illegal immigrants rather than U.S. citizens. The new initiative will facilitate data sharing between the two agencies via newly established lines of communication, according to a press release about the effort, which added that U.S. veterans stood to benefit from the move.
""Americantax dollarsshould be used for the benefit of American citizens, especially when it comes to an issue as pressing as our nation’s housing crisis,"" Turner said Monday. ""This new agreement will leverage resources, including technology and personnel, to ensure American people are the only priority when it comes to public housing. We will continue to work closely with DHS to maximize our resources and put American citizens first.""

In total, per HUD, there are roughly 9 million people who live in subsidized housing across the country. Meanwhile, about 59% of noncitizen households – those including green card holders or illegal immigrants – use one or more public assistance programs, costing taxpayers as much as $42 billion annually, according to theCenter for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for lower immigration levels.
Tens of millions of dollars – at least – went to housing for migrants, including for all-expense-paid stays at hotels for some, during the Biden administration. Some states, such as Pennsylvania and Arizona, passed measures during the Biden administration aimed at ensuring illegal immigrants do not take public housing resources from Americans who need them.
President Donald Trump, shortly after his inauguration,signed an executive ordercalling for an end to illegal immigrants' use of public resources.

A historic agreement would allow ICE to submit the names and addresses of illegal immigrants to cross-check against IRS tax records, a shift in longstanding IRS policy aimed at keeping taxpayer information strictly confidential, according to areport in the Washington Post.
The current draft agreement, obtained by the Washington Post, would limit ICE to confirm the addresses of illegal immigrants who have final removal orders, while Homeland Security SecretaryKristi Noemand acting ICE Director Todd Lyons would be the only two people authorized to submit requests to the IRS.

The draft agreement language authorizes address verification on individuals ""subject to criminal investigation"" for violating immigration law, taking advantage of a narrow exception to IRS privacy laws that allow for the use of taxpayer data to aid criminal investigations.
The report notes that some veteran IRS officials have expressed concerns about the agreement, arguing that the narrow exception was meant only for criminal investigations and not for immigration enforcement. The officials also worry that the policy will hinder tax collection from illegal immigrants, who are still subject to federal taxes despite being in the country illegally.
The IRS has for years given illegal immigrants assurances that their tax information is confidential, the report notes, a policy that has helped them collect over 5 million tax returns from undocumented migrants.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/clean-air-mandates-gas-tax-revenues-roads-bridges-infrastructure-expert,"Clean air mandates exacerbating dearth in gas tax revenues used for roads, bridges, infrastructure: Expert","Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses the Trump administration's energy agenda and declining gas prices on 'Special Report.'
As gas tax revenues plunge, several states are scrambling to fund basic infrastructure repairs—a crisis made worse by clean air mandates pushing automakers toward electric vehicles, according to an energy policy expert.
States primarily usegas tax revenuesto fund the maintenance of infrastructure, like bridges and roads. In Oregon, a state with aggressive climate goals, the Department of Transportation has anticipated that it will face an estimated $350 million budget shortfall due in part to declining gas tax revenues. California, which requires auto manufacturers to sell a certain percentage of zero-emission vehicles, is looking at a potential loss of $5 billion – or 64% – over the next decade, according to analysts.
Jason Isaac is the founder and CEO of the American Energy Institute, a trade organization representing mainly oil and gas companies. He told Fox News Digital that states are losing about $2,506 in gas tax revenue per every EV sold. Isaac said that, in his view, strict EV mandates are exacerbating the dearth in gas tax revenues.

In particular, he pointed to clean air fuel economy requirements.
""Automobile manufacturers are all losing billions of dollars making EVs. The only company that's making money selling EVs is Tesla, and they're making money because they're selling fuel emissions credits to other automobile manufacturers,"" Isaac said. ""Tesla would just break even, maybe a little bit of profit, if it wasn't for the selling of the credits to Ford and GM, Stellantis, and other automobile manufacturers that are forced to buy fuel economy credits because of requirements from the federal government.""
As a result, Isaac said, gas-powered car manufacturers are compelled to make moreelectric vehiclesin an effort to keep up with government mandates.
""It's really destroying the market,"" he said.

Meanwhile, Isaac posited, fuel economy mandates and the ongoing credit-buy-back system have generated a ""multi-billion dollar market out of nothing that's not improving fuel economy.""
""There’s bipartisan support to get rid of these credits,"" he said, adding that the move would help auto manufacturers relying on the system ""to make a comeback and truly improve fuel economy and vehicles, because they won't be wasting billions of dollars from vehicles that people just overwhelmingly don't want. The rates of repurchases are decreasing significantly.""
According to McKinsey & Co.'s2024 Mobility Consumer Pulse,46% of EV owners in the U.S. said they were ""very"" likely to switch back to owning a gas-powered vehicle in their next purchase, due mainly to a lack of charging infrastructure and range limitations.

Different solutions are being considered by states to supplement their lost gas tax revenues, including mile-based road usage charges, taxes on EV charging stations, and increased registration fees for EVs. A debate has also emerged over raising the federal gas tax—which has not increased since 1993—as a potential solution.
Isaac said that in addition to amending federal fuel economy standards, he noted that raising the registration fee for EVs is a good solution. He said putting a tax on electric-vehicle charging stations would likely not generate enough funds to make up for the lost revenue.
Isaac also posited that he was not very keen on the implementation of a vehicle-mile travel tax. He suggested that it could serve as a ""regressive"" tax on lower-income people who are struggling with the cost of housing, because they will have to move out of urban areas to rural or suburban areas, increasing the amount of miles they need to travel for work and other activities.
Isaac is not a proponent of raising the federal gas tax either.
""We don't need to raise the tax, we just need to spend our dollars more efficiently,"" Isaac said. ""I thinkDOGE is going to helpwith that efficiency, so that dollars are truly making it to the maintenance of our nation's infrastructure.""",3/24/2025

Americans have always been defined by their frontier.
It began withthe vast, unexplored West,which historian Frederick Jackson Turner described in an influential 1893 essay as ""a new field of opportunity, a gate of escape from the bondage of the past.""
By the time Turner put pen to paper, the frontier was already closing. Space, the ""final frontier"" in ""Star Trek,"" animated American imaginations for a time, but after the initial excitement of putting a man on the moon, the project seemed to peter out.
HUD IS A 'MISSION-MINDED PLACE,' 'NOT POLITICAL,' SECRETARY SCOTT TURNER SAYS
President Donald Trump promised in his second inaugural address to revive that dream, telling the crowd that ""we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars."" Elon Musk, whose innovations at SpaceX will help make this dream a reality, cheered wildly.

But space cannot be a frontier the way the American West was. In the 19th century, any sturdy lad from the East Coast or Midwest could pack a wagon and light out for the territories. The Homestead Act of 1862 handed out 1.6 million parcels of federal land in the West. Space holds no such promise for the everyman. Astronauts are highly trained specialists, not regular guys with common sense and a good work ethic. The kind of large-scale space colonization that would make the solar system a true frontier might be a century or more in the future.
There are, however, other ways to revive the pioneer spirit. Acquiring Greenland would open up a harsh new environment for hardy would-be homesteaders, but even if the Danes refuse to play ball, Trump still has options.
The U.S. government owns about 620 million acres of land, which comes out to approximately 27% of the country. More than a third ofthat land is in Alaska,with the rest largely concentrated in a few Western states like Arizona (38% federal land), Colorado (36%), Idaho (62%) and Nevada (80%). National Parks make up only around 13% of federal land, leaving plenty of opportunities for development.
Two of Trump’s cabinet secretaries are already on the case.
Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Scott Turner published a Wall Street Journal op-ed March 16, proposing a joint effort tosolve America’s housing crisis.
""Under this agreement, HUD will pinpoint where housing needs are most pressing and guide the process by working with state and local leaders who know their communities best. Interior will identify locations that can support homes while carefully considering environmental impact and land-use restrictions,"" they wrote.

It’s the kind of bold action America needs after four years of Biden-Harris housing policy, which saw rents skyrocket and the cost of a median-price home more than double. Other than a few vague noises about building more houses, the only major solutions they offered were throwing taxpayer dollars at first-time homebuyers (which would have made housing inflation even worse) and new race-based regulation preferring one racial group over another and ultimately aiding neither.
They also sued RealPage, a company that makes rental pricing software (which will have no effect on prices, since the software merely reflects existing market conditions and even suggests lower prices when demand dips). Americans for Tax Reform and over 30 conservative groups sent a letter opposing this Biden Department of Justice suit for this very reason.

Unlike the hackneyed ideas of the past that we saw during the Biden administration, the possibilities of Burgum and Turner’s housing plan are endless — and enticing. Libertarians could found hyper-innovative charter cities governed by CEOs. Devout Catholics could build intentional communities centered on monasteries. Crunchy homesteaders could grow everything they eat on a few acres (and get that land at a discount if they agree to host students from a new federal sustainable agriculture training program).
Ambitious young men (and women) who’ve flooded into the cities would suddenly have options other than exorbitant rent and small-town stagnation. In a start-up city on previously undeveloped federal land, they could become founding fathers (or mothers) and help shape vibrant new communities in the midst of unstained natural beauty. They might even be able to keep their old telecommuting jobs while they do it.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/lower-gas-prices-arent-luck-trumps-energy-policies-fueling-american-independence,Lower gas prices aren’t luck. Trump’s energy policies are fueling American independence,"Energy Secretary Chris Wright discusses the Trump administration's energy agenda and declining gas prices on 'Special Report.'
The American people are starting to notice the change they voted for back in November. Despite all the hyperventilation and handwringing from the mainstream media in their leftist enclaves of New York and Washington D.C., things in the real world are actually starting to look good again. It’s getting more affordable to get to work.Gas prices have dropped for the fourth straight week, and they are absolutely down from where they were under President Joe Biden.
The reason why isn’t a mystery or a secret. We used to have a president who wasat war with American energy.Now, we once again have one who is unleashing it.
For four years,the Biden administration waged war on American energy — from canceling the Keystone XL pipeline to blocking drilling permits, restricting federal land leases and imposing crushing regulations on the oil and gas industry. The result? Gas prices soared, inflation spiked, and the average American family was forced to pay the price — literally. At the peak of Biden’s energy crisis,gas reached over $5 a gallon. That was no accident.
PRO-ENERGY GROUP URGES AG BONDI TO PROBE BIDEN'S AUTOPEN ON CRUCIAL DECISIONS THAT DEVASTATED INDUSTRY
That was a deliberate outcome of a policy designed to make traditional fuels unaffordable so that Americans would have no choice but to accept expensive electric vehicles (for which we still don’t have the infrastructure) and unreliable alternative energy.
Gas prices are down significantly and that's because America no longer has a president who is at war with energy companies.(iStock)
Biden’s policies were never about helping working Americans. They were about forcing an extreme ""environmental"" agenda that made energy more expensive, all while claiming their reckless ""green"" policies would somehow save the planet. In other words, your family’s budget was experimented on with the force of the federal government.Compare that to what’s happening now after just a few weeks.
In just a matter of weeks, gas prices have been dropping. More than two-thirds of U.S. gas stations are selling gas for $2.99 per gallon or less. Thenational average is $3.02 per gallon,down 42 cents from last year. Meanwhile, let’s not forget where things stood under Biden. At this point in Joe Biden’s presidency, gas prices had already jumped up 49 cents.
That wasn’t some global crisis; it was the result of bad policy.
By contrast, the momentPresident Donald Trump took office,he got to work fixing the problem. He declared aNational Energy Emergency, cut through the bureaucratic red tape strangling domestic production, and put an end to Biden’s disastrous policies. Biden’s energy agenda was never about saving the climate — if it were, his administration wouldn’t have ignored the fact that China and India are the world’s biggest polluters. It was about virtue signaling to the far left while working-class families paid the price.
Trump understands what the radical left refuses to admit: Energy security is national security, and economic security is family security. That’s why he has prioritized an all-of-the-above energy strategy that puts America first. Under his leadership, major energy producers are ramping up output, the U.S. is fast-tracking new energy infrastructure, and we areregaining our position as the world’s top energy producer.

And there are more wins on the way. In February, Trump established the National Energy Dominance Council — a major step toward ensuring America’s energy independence is never compromised again. Chaired by Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum and Vice-Chaired by Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, the Council brings together key members of Trump’s cabinet and top government agencies to oversee the resurgence of American energy dominance.This isn’t just about reversing course — it’s about securing America’s energy future, fostering innovation and ensuring that our nation remains the world’s leading energy powerhouse. With America’s vast oil and gas resources and a constant flow of American innovation in the energy industry, America stands primed to lead the world into the next century of prosperity if we proceed wisely.
Biden’s policies were never about helping working Americans. They were about forcing an extreme ""environmental"" agenda that made energy more expensive, all while claiming their reckless ""green"" policies would somehow save the planet.
The Biden administration spent four years trying to convince Americans that high gas prices were just the new normal. They said it was ""Putin’s price hike,"" a ""global supply issue,"" or anything else to avoid admitting the truth about their policies. The American people know when they’re being played, everyone paying attention knew that gas prices didn’t skyrocket by accident.

Now, with Trump back in charge, gas prices are falling, and the same people who claimed the government had no control over them arescrambling to explain why. They won’t admit it, but the answer is simple: conservative, America-first energy policies work.
The recentprice drop under President Trump is what happens when America embraces energy independence instead of bowing to climate radicals and foreign competitors. American energy is back on the market, and its golden age has only just begun.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-outside-the-box-gold-card-proposal-could-remarkable-game-changer,Trump's outside-the-box 'gold card' proposal could be a remarkable game changer,"Ohio GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno told Fox News Digital that the Chicago mayor is a 'bumbling idiot' and praised President Trump’s immigration agenda
Most people don’t think about where the money comes from to build the things we use daily—hospitals, hotels, train systems, and office buildings. However, in many cases, those projects exist because of the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Program, a little-known government initiative that helps create jobs and fund businesses without using taxpayer money.
At its core, EB-5 is simple: Foreign investors put money into U.S. businesses, and in return, they get a chance to apply for a green card. But to qualify, their investment must create at least 10 full-time American jobs. That means the EB-5 program doesn’t just fund big projects—it also provides real jobs for everyday people in industries like construction, healthcare, and hospitality.
And now, with talk of apotential ""Gold Card,""a program for ultra-wealthy investors, even more private money could flow into the U.S. economy, helping pay off national debt and fueling job growth. When speaking about the Gold Card, Trump said it ""will allow the most successful job-creating people from all over the world to buy a path to U.S. citizenship.""
TRUMP TOUTS $5 MILLION ‘GOLD CARD’ AS NEW PATH TO CITIZENSHIP
A key advantage of the Gold Card would be that it would not impose global taxation, which is a significant deterrent for the wealthiest investors under EB-5. Many ultra-wealthy individuals send their children to the U.S. but avoid moving themselves due to tax concerns. By offering residency without taxing worldwide income, the Gold Card could unlock billions in foreign investment while allowing EB-5 to remain focused on job creation. These programs would diversify investment, strengthen infrastructure, and driveU.S. economic growth.
Here’s how EB-5 has already made a difference in communities across the country:
The biggest impact of EB-5 is job creation. Every investor must generate at least 10full-time jobsfor American workers. That means more construction workers, nurses, factory workers, engineers, and hotel staff getting hired.
For example, the Big River Steel Mill in Arkansas and the Philadelphia Convention Center expansion were both made possible with EB-5 funding—creating thousands of jobs and keeping paychecks flowing for local workers.
When you drive on a well-paved road, visit a new hospital, or take public transportation, there’s a chance it was funded in part by EB-5.
Brightline, Florida’s high-speed rail system connecting Miami to Orlando, is a great example. Instead of relying completely on government funding, private EB-5 investors helped make the project a reality, reducing traffic congestion and boosting local businesses.
EB-5 investments don’t just benefit big cities—they also bring businesses, jobs, and services to rural and struggling areas.
TakeHarrison County Community Hospital in Missouri—an EB-5-funded project that ensured local residents could access quality healthcare close to home. Without this program, many similar projects wouldn’t have the funding to get off the ground.

Unlike government stimulus programs that rely ontax dollars, EB-5 is a self-sustaining program. Since its creation, it has attracted over $55 billion in foreign investment, funding projects that directly benefit American communities, businesses, and workers.
And the best part? This money doesn’t come from taxpayers—it comes from private investors who are required to create American jobs.
As a leader in the EB-5 industry for over 13 years, I have witnessed firsthand how this program transforms communities and strengthens the U.S. economy. Through my company, EB5 Investors, I have worked with investors from all over the world, helping direct billions of dollars into job-creating projects across the U.S. This is more than just business—it’s about creating real opportunities for American workers at no cost to taxpayers.

The Bottom Line: EB-5 Helps Everyday Americans
Whether it’s a paycheck, a hospital in your town, or a hotel where you work, the EB-5 program quietly improves the lives of everyday Americans.
With the potential for a new Gold Card program, increasing visa caps, and streamlining the EB-5 process, the U.S. could attract even more private investment, creating thousands of additional jobs and fueling economic growth—all without costing taxpayers a cent. Like many other Trump plans, this appears to be a novel and out-of-the-box approach to our immigration system and ournational debt—one that should not be overlooked.

The president touts that ""a lot of great things are happening"" and that ""things are doing very well,"" but it’s clear that Americans are divided on the job Trump’s doing so far in his second tour of duty in the White House.
Trump’s approval rating stood at 49% in the latest Fox News national survey, with 51% giving the president a thumbs down in the survey, which was conducted March 14-17.
PROBLEMATIC POLL NUMBERS FOR THE DEMOCRATS
The Fox News poll is the latest national survey to Trump’s approval rating slightly underwater, and it’s also the latest to indicate a massive partisan divide over the president and his agenda.
Ninety-two percent of Republican respondents approved of the president’s performance, while an equal percentage of Democrats gave Trump a big thumbs down. More than six-in-ten independents said they disapproved of the job Trump is doing.

The president’s 49% overall approval rating matches the all-time high for Trump in Fox News polling, which he last reached in April 2020, near the end of his first term in office. And that’s six points higher than where he stood at this point in his first administration (43% approval in March 2017).
Trump’s poll numbers were almost entirely in negative territory in most surveys for the entirety of his first term in office.

""The difference is largely a function of the consolidation of the Republican base,"" Daron Shaw, who serves as a member of the Fox News Decision Team and is the Republican partner onthe Fox News Poll, noted.
""The party’s completely solidified behind him,"" added Shaw, a politics professor and chair at the University of Texas, who noted that Trump’s current rock-solid GOP support wasn’t the case at the start of the first term, when he had troubles with some Republicans.
Shaw highlighted that ""Democrats were consolidated against Trump in 2017. They’re consolidated against him now.""
Pointing to recent polls indicating Democratic Party favorability at all-time lows, he said ""they don’t like their own party very much, but they all agreed that they don’t like Trump.""

While Trump’s poll numbers are superior to where he stood eight years ago, there's been a bit of slippage.
An average of all the most recent national polls indicates that Trump's approval ratings are just below water. Trump has seen his numbers edge down slightly since returning to the White House in late January, when an average of his polls indicated the president's approval rating in the low 50s and his disapproval in the mid-40s.
Contributing to the slide – the economy and jitters that Trump’s tariffs on both foes and friends will spark further inflation, which was a pressing issue that kept former President Biden’s approval ratings well below water for most of his presidency.

The latest Fox News poll as well as other recent surveys point to growing skepticism about Trump’s economic actions and policies.
Shaw says it all comes down to independents.
""If the Republicans are locked down in favor of Trump and Democrats locked down in opposition, it’s just independents,"" he said.
Polls indicate independents are currently giving Trump a thumbs down on his handling of the economy.
But Shaw offered that ""if inflation comes down a bit, if there’s some growth, those numbers are going to flip. That’s what independents do. They go with the times.""

In his address to ajoint session of Congress, the president predicted that ""our country is on the verge of a comeback the likes of which the world has never witnessed."" That prediction is backed up by his recent announcements of massive new private sector investments in AI infrastructure and new executive orders to ensure that the U.S. leads the world in the industries of the future.
In order to fulfill the promise that those actions suggest, however, it’s essential that PresidentDonald Trumpsupport steps to shore up America’s intellectual property system, the cornerstone of our innovation economy, rooting out malicious foreign interests and installing new leadership to help guide the comeback.
To start, we need to address the fact that legal damages for patent infringement are no longer calculated reliably. U.S. courts have strayed from commonsense assessments to the detriment of American innovation.

When a company is sued for patent infringement, the potential damages should be limited to the specificvalue of the underlying technology. Unfortunately, this narrow focus has become more relaxed, and plaintiffs are now asserting damages calculations far greater than their intellectual property’s value.
WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES
Consider the advancedchips powering AI technologies. Each chip contains thousands of parts, many of which are covered by separate patents. If a plaintiff accuses a chipmaker of patent infringement, it should be able to claim only damages limited to the value its patented invention adds to the chip’s value. Instead, courts are increasingly awarding damages based on the entire chip’s value.
The outcome is unreasonably large damages awards. In 2024, verdicts greater than $10 million, $50 million, and $100 million in patent cases were up over prior years. We are even seeing cases where damages reach into the billions. Excessive damages are an unjust financial drain for high-tech manufacturers and an array of other innovative companies forced to pay more than they should owe.
Bloated damages are chum in the legal waters. Chum attracts sharks. In this case, non-practicing entities (NPEs) – which do not invent devices or techniques, or build and sell products – but collect patents to bring, and profit from, lawsuits claiming infringement. More than half of allpatent infringement lawsuitsin the U.S. are now initiated by NPEs, as the patent lawsuit business has attracted a surge of outside capital.
The possibility of winning eye-popping damages has caught the attention of litigation investors who fund legal actions in exchange for a share of any financial return. Litigation investment is a big business, totaling more than $15 billion in the U.S. today; and patent cases have been the largest category for new financial commitments in recent years.
THE LEFT THINKS TRUMP'S TARIFFS ARE A DECLARATION OF WAR. BUT THEY'RE CLUELESS ABOUT THE BATTLEFIELD
NPEs pursuing large damages awards are ideal investment vehicles, particularly because in many jurisdictions the investor is allowed to remain anonymous. President Trump’s CIA Director John Ratcliffe referred to NPEs by their more familiar colloquial name ""patent trolls"" when he explained the trouble with this arrangement, namely that ""by funding patent trolls – shell companies whose sole purpose is to file patent infringement lawsuits – nefarious third parties, including foreign adversaries, can use intellectual property to attack U.S. companies through lawsuits.""
U.S. patent grants to global competitors are surging. In 2024, China-based companies saw a 32% increase in U.S. patents granted and foreign companies are making plays for superiority across a range of cutting-edge industries. Among them,a Chinese startup, DeepSeek, released an AI model that challenges the best that American companies have to offer.
It is crucial that we strengthen the rules governing our intellectual property system so that American innovators are not further hampered by those who attempt to game the system.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING MOVES TO BRING A GOLDEN AGE TO AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESSES
Three reforms are necessary to address root causes of this abuse. First, federal courts should reassert their role as evidentiary gatekeepers, ensuring that unreliable expert testimony, which inflates damages, is not presented to the jury. We can’t expect juries to make accurate decisions if they are fed bad information by supposed experts.
Second, Congress should pass Rep. Darrell Issa’s Litigation Transparency Act, a simple transparency measure mandating that litigation investors disclose their involvement in cases.
And finally, the Trump administration must bolster the U.S. Patent Office’s Patent Trial Appeal Board (PTAB) to give our innovators resources to deter and defend against abuse. The PTAB, and the administrative patent judges (APJs) who serve there, are tasked with invalidating bad patents, many of which are being used by NPEs to extort productive companies.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
APJs do their jobs much more efficiently than the federal courts and the PTAB is funded by fees, not by taxpayers. The president’s newnominee to lead the Patent Office, John Squires, would be wise to ensure the PTAB can continue this important work.
Right-sizing damages awards, increasing judicial transparency, and empowering the Patent Office’s patent quality review will remove barriers to economic progress and prevent our competitors from undermining American industries. All should be priorities for policymakers in the days to come.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/how-we-protect-us-dollar-dominance-digital-age,This is how we protect US dollar dominance in the digital age,"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent responds to economic uncertainty, breaking down President Donald Trump's fiscal and cryptocurrency goals on 'My View with Lara Trump.'
History will record Washington’s embrace of digital assets this year as an inflection point for thenext era of U.S. dollar dominance. Both the Trump administration and Congress are prioritizing an America First approach to the blockchain, ensuring we are the ones defining how these new digital assets are used, traded and created at home and abroad.
Our opportunity now is to ensure that we shape this trend to serve American businesses and families. If the dollar is to be the currency of the digital age, then Washington must act to make that happen.
The good news is that durable, bipartisan progress is emerging. TheSenate Banking Committeejust advanced first-of-its-kind legislation for one key part of the blockchain ecosystem – stablecoins – in a landslide 18-6 vote.  The House appears ready to follow with its version.
The strength of the U.S. dollar is not just a matter of national pride – it has tangible benefits for American businesses and families.(Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)
This congressional push reflects a shared national imperative for economic and technology competitiveness. Stablecoins are digital dollars that move securely, instantly and freely on blockchain networks. These are not cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin that have significant price volatility. Stablecoins are fully reserved assets, meaning their value is always pegged one-for-one with the U.S. dollar.
WHY US MUST ASSERT INDUSTRIAL DOMINANCE IN LIGHT OF CHINA-EUROPE TIES
Stablecoins are also a key tool inmodernizing the dollarfor the digital age by making all types of transactions cheaper, safer and more efficient. If regulated properly, they can cement the U.S. dollar as the most widely used currency for the fast-growing internet financial system – enshrining American economic strength for the next generation in the process. President Trump said as much at the Blockworks Digital Assets Summit, calling on Congress to pass ""common-sense"" legislation and affirming dollar-backed stablecoins will ""unleash an explosion of economic growth, and … expand the dominance of the U.S. dollar.""
This shift in U.S. financial policy toward the blockchain may seem sudden, but it has been years in the making, dating back to when I served in the first Trump administration. And it reflects the structural trend of digitization that has already reshaped every sector aside from finance over the past few decades.
As White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks explained, ""Financial assets are destined to become digital like every other analog industry has become digital and we want that value creation to happen in the United States.""
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) recently reinforced this shift by announcing that national banks can issue and process stablecoins, marking a major step toward integrating these digital dollars into the traditional banking system.
THE LEFT THINKS TRUMP'S TARIFFS ARE A DECLARATION OF WAR. BUT THEY'RE CLUELESS ABOUT THE BATTLEFIELD
This move legitimizes stablecoins as a core component of theU.S. financial infrastructureand provides regulated institutions with clarity to operate in this market. Importantly, stablecoins can serve this role only if they are subject to clear federal rules about reserves, transparency, one-for-one redeemability – key features that inspire trust.
Thankfully, the bills moving in both houses of Congress are promising. Any good law would ensure that consumers are shielded from tokens masquerading as payment stablecoins that do not adhere to U.S. rule of law and oversight.
Stablecoin issuers should be required to publicly disclose their reserves and be open to independent audits to confirm those disclosures. And we should also ensure that American companies compete on a level playing field with offshore issuers and are incentivized to build and grow here in the U.S.
The strength of the U.S. dollar is not just a matter of national pride – it has tangible benefits for American businesses and families. A dominant and stable dollar means lower borrowing costs for businesses and homeowners, as global demand for dollar-denominated assets helps keep interest rates lower. It also translates into dramatically more efficient point-of-sale for merchants, reducing costs for retailers and consumers.
PRESIDENT TRUMP IS MAKING MOVES TO BRING A GOLDEN AGE TO AMERICAN SMALL BUSINESSES
A strong dollar helps curb inflation by making imports more affordable, ensuring that American households retain more of their purchasing power. When the dollar remains the global standard, American workers and businesses benefit from easier access to capital and trade opportunities, reinforcing U.S. economic leadership.
The effort tofutureproof the U.S. dollarfor the digital age is a rare issue that resonates across the political spectrum. For Republicans, it strengthens U.S. innovation and competitiveness against global adversaries. For Democrats, it represents an opportunity to modernize financial infrastructure, promote economic inclusion, and ensure strong consumer protections.
Both sides recognize that a well-regulated stablecoin framework can reinforce the dollar’s role in global finance while safeguarding economic security at home.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Stablecoins are not just a technological breakthrough; they represent an evolution in the very fabric of global finance. If harnessed correctly, they will secure the dollar’s preeminence for generations to come.
With strategic vision and regulatory clarity, the U.S. can seize this opportunity and ensure that the dollar remains the anchor of the international monetary system in the digital age. This could be another legacy moment for PresidentDonald Trumpand congressional leaders.

""We're certainly again looking at case by case as we plan workforce reduction,"" the seniorU.S. defense official,who served more than 10 years in the Army prior to working for the department on the civilian side, said.
""So there are so many critical skills and experience that veterans have to offer. And that's part of the analysis. When we consider who is contributing to the core mission functions and who should be retained,"" he said.

As President Donald Trump has argued, America’s economic securityisournational security, whether it’s reshoring jobs in critical industries or promoting robust commerce to create the jobs and technologies that will drive the world economy during this new Golden Age and into the future.
America is alreadythe leader in AI, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, agriculture, energy and more – but that position can still be threatened not just by China, our greatest economic adversary, but also by some of our oldest allies in the European Union.
As China seeks to weaken the U.S. and expand its global influence, it's eyeing the 27-nation EU as a partner against American industry. In critical sectors – auto manufacturing, clean energy, technology, aerospace and defense – China is tightening its grip on European markets.

For years, China and the U.S. have been neck-and-neck as the EU’s largest trading partner. But as the EU is rushing to curb itsreliance on the U.S. for national security, the EU-China economic ties are only growing stronger.
PROTECTING AMERICANS’ DATA FROM CHINA IS CENTRAL TO AN AMERICA FIRST AGENDA
China is now the world’s largest car-exporting country and that’s in large part thanks to the popularity of Chinese electric vehicles (EVs) in Europe. In fact, in 2023 the number of Chinese EVs exported to Europe outperformed American EV exports. Projections indicate that the market share of Chinese brands in Europe could rise from 2.5% in 2023 to nearly 10% by 2034, even despite tariffs imposed by the European Commission.
Similarly, the EU’s goal to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050 is fueling a deeper dependence on China. The EU remains heavily reliant on China for raw minerals to support solar and wind supply chains. The European Commission recently admitted that 75% of recent solar modules installed in Europe were imported from China.
China’s technology ambitions are clear: surpass the U.S., infiltrate the industries of the future and threaten our national security in the process. Its curiously titled ""Made in China 2025"" initiative aims to position the country as the global leader in advanced manufacturing, particularly in AI, robotics, aerospace and clean energy.
CHINA THREATENS OUR FARMERS AND FOOD SUPPLY. STATES NEED TO STEP UP
China has already overtaken the U.S. in patent applications. The state massively invests in semiconductor production and green tech to reduce its reliance on American technology and control much of the world’s supply chain for battery cells, solar modules and wind turbines. With billions pouring into research and development and state-backed firms to compete with U.S. giants like Google and Microsoft, China is directly challenging U.S. innovation and security.
China’s state-backed aerospace manufacturer is now planning to expand further into Western markets with deeper investment into European jet maker Airbus and compete with America’s dominant aerospace industry and its largest company, Boeing.
Supporting American-made aerospace companies, which are prioritized to partner with the U.S. government as a builder and supplier of cutting-edge warfighting technologies, is critical for economic and national security. American-made companies have an integrated supply chain throughout the country and Boeing specifically is a market leader around the world as one of America’s largest exporters.

Undermining American companies and prioritizing Chinese-backed companies doesn’t just weaken American industry – it opens the door for adversaries like China to overtake the market and weaken America itself.
America stands at a crossroads. Biden-era regulations have already weakened flagship American companies, putting our global competitiveness at risk. If we allow China to tighten its grip on critical industries – whether through EV dominance in Europe, control over green energy supply chains, or its continued push for technological supremacy – werisk ceding our economic futureto a regime that seeks to displace us.
Boeing is a great example, despite its challenges, for how prioritizing American-made companies over adversaries like China and other nations that partner with China is essential to both our economic and national security. Without its success, Airbus and Chinese manufacturers will dominate the aerospace and defense industries, leaving America vulnerable.

Republican lawmakers must stand behind PresidentDonald Trump’s America First agenda to ensure U.S. companies remain strong, competitive and capable of leading the world. This isn’t just about economics – it’s about securing the future of America, protecting our national security and ensuring that American innovation continues to drive global progress.
If we fail to protect our critical industries, we risk handing over our future to those who would seek to undermine us on the global stage. To preserve America’s economic and national security, we must prioritize policies that empower American businesses, defend innovation and ensure we remain the world’s technology superpower.

The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is requesting data from 20 law firms about employment practices to increase diversity, equity and inclusion, which the federal agency warns may be illegal.
The commission's acting chair, Andrea Lucas, sent letters to the firms seeking detailed information on DEI programs that may be in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.
Some of the companies have made legal challenges to PresidentDonald Trump'spolicies targeting DEI or have connections to his political opponents. Perkins Coie; Hogan Lovells; Ropes & Gray; and WilmerHale are among the firms currently representing plaintiffs in lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Lucas said some of the firms had made public statements expressing their commitment to diversity in their workforces. At least two of the firms had numerical goals for recruiting lawyers based on their race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identity.

She expressed concern that the firms' employment practices ""may entail unlawful disparate treatment in terms, conditions, and privileges of employment, or unlawful limiting, segregating, and classifying"" based on race, sex and other protected characteristics.
""The EEOC is prepared to root out discrimination anywhere it may rear its head, including in our nation’s elite law firms,"" Lucas said in a statement. ""No one is above the law—and certainly not the private bar.""
The letters requested information about the internships, scholarships and fellowships the firms offer to law students, as well as the firms' hiring and compensation practices.
Lucas also asked for the name, sex and race of every lawyer who has worked at orapplied for a jobat one of the firms since 2019 and wanted to know if each of them participated in diversity programs.
Some of the information was asked to be included in a ""searchable Excel spreadsheet.""

The EEOC can investigate companies' employment practices and file lawsuits over allegations of discrimination, but only after a worker or one of the agency's five commissioners brings a formal complaint. The agency gave no indication that Lucas had filed complaints against any of the firms.
Trump has sought to eliminate DEI programs across the country, including in the federal government, higher education and the private sector.
The president has also taken action against high-profile law firms over their DEI practices.
Trump issued executive orders this month targeting Perkins Coie as well as Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison over the two firms' alleged discriminatory internal diversity policies and previous work for his political opponents. The orders revoked security clearances for lawyers at the firms and restricted their government access and federal contracting work.
The order targeting Perkins Coie also directed Lucas to ""review the practices of representative large, influential, or industry-leading law firms"" even though the commission was designed to operate independently of the White House.

Perkins Coie sued on allegations that the order violated its rights under the U.S. Constitution. A judge temporarily blocked parts of the order last week.
Some companies have previously adopted policies to encourage diversity from theiroutside law firms.
Lucas, in the letters, asked law firms to identify clients since 2019 that have had ""diversity requirements"" or stated preferences for employee staffing. She also asked for the firms' actions in response to the client requirements, including producing related documents.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-approval-rating-matches-all-time-high-numbers-new-poll-finds,"Trump’s approval rating matches his all-time high, new poll finds","Sen. Bernie Moreno, R-Ohio, joins ‘Fox News Sunday’ to discuss the potential effects of President Donald Trump’s tariffs on domestic manufacturing and more.
PresidentDonald Trump’scurrent approval rating matches his highest approval rating ever as president — even though a majority of voters disapprove of how Trump is handling the job, according to a new poll.
Forty-seven percent of registered voters approve of Trump’s performance presently — which equals his previous all-time high during the entirety of his political career, a national NBC News poll released Sunday found. Likewise, the poll found that 44% of voters believe the country is on the right track — another all-time high for the president.
However, 51% disapprove of his performance and 54% consider the country on the wrong track, according to the poll.
As a result, the survey determined that the bulk of Trump’s support bolstering his approval rating comes from Republicans.
The poll also found that Trump has the largest partisan divide between his approval rating from Republicans versus Democrats in the past 80 years, based on previous NBC News polling and data from Gallup. While 90% of Republicans approve of Trump’s performance, only 4% of Democrats approve.
TRUMP PROMISES ‘THIS WILL BE OUR GREATEST ERA’ IN JOINT ADDRESS TO CONGRESS
President Donald Trump's approval ratings at the moment match his all-time high, a new survey found.
Meanwhile, a majority of voters disapprove of how he’s handlingthe economy— marking a first in the history of NBC News polls. Just 18% of voters consider the economy ""excellent"" or ""good,"" the poll found.
Those numbers are even more stark along party lines. Twenty-six percent of Republicans responded that the state of the economy was ""excellent"" or ""good,"" while only 11% of Democrats responded the same way.
The response indicates a stark shift from several months ago. It is a dramatic change from October 2024, when 5% of Republicans replied the state of the economy was ""excellent"" or ""good,"" in comparison to 52% of Democrats.
A majority of voters do approve of Trump’s handling of immigration and border security, with 55% endorsing his performance. In comparison, 43% of voters said they disapprove. The Trump administration has promised to drive down illegal border crossings and Trump touted on March 6 that his administration has ""launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history.""
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also cited the survey in a Monday press briefing, noting that the poll found that the approval rating of the Democratic Party has reached its lowest numbers in all of NBC News polling history. The survey found that 27% of registered voters held a favorable opinion of the Democratic Party. As a result, Leavitt said that a ""hatred"" of Trump isn't a winning strategy.

The poll kicked off a day after Trump delivered a joint address to members of Congress, when he vowed that he would tackle the economy and work to reduce prices, after blaming former PresidentJoe Bidenfor leaving him an economic disaster. Consumer prices increased roughly 20% under Biden’s administration, according to the consumer price index.
""Among my very highest priorities is to rescue our economy and get dramatic and immediate relief to working families,"" Trump told lawmakers March 6. ""As president, I am fighting every day to reverse this damage and make America affordable again.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/doug-schoen-im-lifelong-democrat-my-party-failing-needs-learn-from-winner,DOUG SCHOEN: I'm a lifelong Democrat. My party is failing and needs to learn from a winner,"Sen. John Fetterman urged fellow Democrats on Tuesday to speak like normal people when pressed by MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle on the rise of ""oligarchs.""
Right now,it is clear that the Democratsare at a pivotal moment, and we need to choose an agenda that genuinely addresses Americans’ concerns.
In the mid 1990’s, whenformer President Bill Clintonran for re-election, he chose an agenda that spoke to the American people, not his party’s most extreme wing.
It is critical that Democrats use a similar method today.
First and foremost, there has to be recognition that, while the electorate does want fundamental change, it is not enough to say, ""we need to stand up to Trump and demonstrate against him.""
Former President Bill Clinton listened to ordinary Americans, not the extreme wing of his own party. FILE: Clinton raises his hand to the crowd before giving his acceptance speech Thursday night at the1996 Democratic National Convention at the United Center.(Harry Hamburg/NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images)
I understand the logic, but this simply does not work.
Our party needs to stand for clear ideas and have an agenda reflecting a worldview that is distinctive, but not adversarial.
In other words, Democrats need to show themselves as a competent alternative to the GOP, but they cannot do so if their entire agenda is one of resistance.
Let’s be clear: the American people want a reduction in inflation, a secure border and a smaller, more efficient government that produces economic growth and can create jobs in other ways that increasing its own size.
Clinton noted as much in 1996 when he said the era of big government is over. This concept is increasingly alien to today’s Democratic Party, which has yet to familiarize itself with the idea that the government can deliver for people without being excessively large.
That being said, the American people – and financial markets – are clearly uncomfortable with the extreme behaviors currently coming out of the administration.
For example, what Elon Musk and DOGE are doing agency by agency is well-intentioned, in theory, but the chaotic, wholesale cutting of entire agencies on a whim threatens to upend the economy.
Democrats need an alternative to DOGE, yet they’ve failed to even have this conversation.
Democrats should consider their own version of DOGE. FILE: Elon Musk speaks during an event in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump at the White House on Feb. 11.(AP Images)
Beyond that, we need to take steps to spur economic growth. As the Wall Street Journalhighlighted, an extremely positive Trump policy was letting companies deduct the full cost of capex in the year they’re made.
Democrats should adopt that growth-supporting policy, and others such aspreserving state and local taxesdeduction (SALT) and extending tax cuts.
Further, Democrats must abandon their overly regulatory ideas that increase costs and delays in building housing and infrastructure. California Democrat Gov. Gavin Newsom recently adopted this approach in rebuilding his state, but the rest of the party has failed to follow.
This goes far beyond basic economic principles. Rather, it is rapidly becoming a significant political vulnerability for Democrats, as New York Times columnist Ezra Klein aptly described.
Writing in the Times, Klein noted that Democratic strongholds have seen massive population decreases almost entirely because Democrats’ anti-growth and overly regulatory agenda makes the cost of living in blue cities and states out of reach.
Not only is this going to erode Democrats’ political power by shifting congressional and Electoral College votes to traditionally red states, but also gives the lie to Democrats’ claim to be the party of the working class.
Moreover, Democrats need to begin promoting school choice and even supporting the role of charter schools. For one example, Success Academy has been a model institution, and this should not be overlooked, particularly as our public-school systems continue to receive failing grades.
To that end, progressives will blame the state of public education on the Trump administration’s disdain for the Department of Education, but the facts are that the nation’s worst schools tend to be in deep blue areas.
Democrats need an alternative to DOGE, yet they’ve failed to even have this conversation.
Beyond this, we need different types of schools, as it’s no longer true that every job requires a four-year degree. Vocational and trade schools are just as important, and should be supported equally, if not more so.
Critically, Democrats also need to come up with a commonsense approach to border security.
There is absolutely no reason that Democrats should be attacking the Trump administration for closing the border just months after an election where voters overwhelmingly rejected progressives’ open border policy.
True, a significant question remains as to how we can forge a bipartisan immigration deal that recognizes that Dreamers and those that have played by the rules deserve a pathway to citizenship. But there is no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater and refuse to work with the GOP on this.
New York Times columnist Ezra Klein wrote how Democrat-dominated cities and states are anti-growth and losing population. FILE: Klein during an interview on September 14, 2017.(Lloyd Bishop/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images)
Along the same lines, the Laken Riley act, which a number of Democrats voted for, is a clear example of what most people find logical and reasonable.
There should be absolutely no room or leniency for criminals who are here illegally. That is not inhumane, it is the most basic level of common sense.
Taken together, Democrats must realize that they’re failing to provide an alternative. They’re so consumed with resistance that they’ve been unable to muster, ""Yes, we are for smaller government, but key programs such as Medicare or Medicaid should be protected.""
Finally, there needs to be a sense of hope, aspiration and commitment to stability both at home and abroad.
Tariffs are fine to protect ourselves from China, but – as the markets have shown – they are less OK when those policies change every few days, as we’ve seen with Mexico and Canada.
Predictability and stability need to be the bedrock of our foreign policy.

No one opposes the idea of ending the war in Ukraine, or that the U.S. should recoup some benefits. It is also hard to not have been sympathetic to the American president given what happened in the Oval Office, when Trump met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.
Of course, it gladdened me to see President Donald Trump restore American intelligence sharing and military aid to Ukraine, as America’s role in defending that country from Russian aggression remains essential.
There should be absolutely no room or leniency for criminals who are here illegally. That is not inhumane, it is the most basic level of common sense.
Ultimately, the argument for Democrats is really one of stability, hope and a sincere commitment to the American people.
If the Democrats do that and can articulate these policies, there is a chance to retake the House in the midterms. But doing stupidvideos, holding up silly signs during the joint address to Congress, and staging demonstrations is worse than harmful, it is embarrassing.

TRUMP CREATES STRATEGIC BITCOIN RESERVE, OTHER CRYPTOCURRENCIES TO BE USED IN STOCKPILE
President Donald Trump signed an executive order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve last week, just a day before the first-of-its-kind crypto summit.
""A U.S. Crypto Reserve will elevate this critical industry after years of corrupt attacks by the Biden Administration, which is why my Executive Order on Digital Assets directed the Presidential Working Group to move forward on a Crypto Strategic Reserve that includes XRP, SOL, and ADA,""Trump wrote.
""I will make sure the U.S. is the Crypto Capital of the World. We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" he added.
Crypto czar David Sackscelebrated the move via a post on X.
""The Reserve will be capitalized with Bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. This means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,"" he wrote. ""It is estimated that the U.S. government owns about 200,000 bitcoin; however, there has never been a complete audit. The E.O. directs a full accounting of the federal government’s digital asset holdings. The U.S. will not sell any bitcoin deposited into the Reserve. It will be kept as a store of value. The Reserve is like a digital Fort Knox for the cryptocurrency often called ‘digital gold.’""
""The big news is that this will be the first administration that's going to say this sector belongs in America. The development should be here. The technology should be mastered here. We should lead the world in it. Other administrations didn't do that, and I think we should celebrate it because I think we shouldn't fall behind on this,"" O'Leary told Fox News hostLara Trumpduring his interview at Pubkey bitcoin bar in New York City.

""Now, the top 20% controls over 50% of the GDP. Our economy was an upward funnel of wealth, and the largest share, which used to be in manufacturing, which gave a lot of working class people a middle class standard of living, now the largest share is in real estate and finance, meaning that asset-rich Americans are controlling over 50% of the GDP, and they have left the working class out of all of that prosperity that was generated.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/left-thinks-trumps-tariffs-declaration-war-theyre-clueless-about-battlefield,The left thinks Trump's tariffs are a declaration of war. But they're clueless about the battlefield,"'America's Newsroom' panelists Mark Tepper and Lydia Moynihan analyze how tariffs could impact Americans.
When the U.S. declared war on Japan on December 8, 1941, no one dared see the U.S. as the aggressor because Japan had already bombedPearl Harbor. That’s precisely how President Donald Trump’s tariff fight should be viewed: America isn’t the aggressor but is simply defending herself.
The discussion about tariffs is not happening in a vacuum. The important context here is decades of other countries imposing stiff tariffs and non-tariff barriers (NTBs) on the U.S. while stealing our intellectual property, sending everything from violent criminals todeadly fentanylpouring across our borders.
Considering all these economic and non-economic factors, there are good reasons for President Trump taking such a tough stand on nations like Canada.
TRUMP'S 25% TARIFF INCREASE ON ALL STEEL, ALUMINUM IMPORTS TAKES EFFECT, PROMPTING RETALIATION FROM EUROPE
Our neighbor to the north imposes stiff tariffs and has insurmountable NTBs for many markets. Numerous American exporters have better access to Russian consumer markets than to Canadian ones!
For example,Canada imposes tariffs and NTBs, like quotas, that create an effective tax rate up to 270 percent on American dairy exports and other products, making them uncompetitive, at any price.
President Trump is not the aggressor here. He’s merely responding to long-standing economic attacks from a supposed friend.
Canada also allows China to abuse country-of-origin provisions in the US-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (USMCA), effectively giving China a backdoor into American consumer markets that circumvents tariffs on Chinese products.
President Trump is not the aggressor here. He’s merely responding to long-standing economic attacks from a supposed friend.
Likewise, most of America’s other trading partners do not treat her fairly.The European Union (EU), for instance, imposes a 10 percent tariff on U.S. automobiles while the U.S. has just a 2.5 percent tariff on European autos, and the EU’s value-added taxes make the disparity even worse.
India imposes tariffs of up to 150 percent on American exports like whiskey, compared to 2 percent charged on Indian spirits coming into America.
Japan imposes a 25% tariffon American beef, while we impose just a 2% tariff on Japanese beef.
All these tariffs and NTBs penalize American industry, and the American worker, making it impossible for either to compete on the world stage by making U.S. exports more expensive and forcing U.S. companies to pay these tariffs to other nation’s treasuries.
While negotiating tariffs in his first term, President Trump told the EU he would eliminate all tariffs and NTBs if the EU did the same. Instead of accepting this truly free-trade deal, the EU balked because it doesn’t actually want a level playing field.
Instead, it wants protectionism for its own industries but completely free access to American markets. Sorry, but that’s not how America does business anymore.
Reciprocal tariffs are the economic corollary to the Golden Rule: if you penalize our exporters and workers, we will penalize yours. If you make our companies pay steep tariffs, yours will too.
President Trump’s critics have alleged that his strategy will spark a catastrophic global trade war, but that misguided assessment seems to assume we already have a global level playing field and universal free trade—which is not the case.
Reciprocal tariffs are the economic corollary to the Golden Rule: if you penalize our exporters and workers, we will penalize yours. If you make our companies pay steep tariffs, yours will too.
Rather, President Trump is merely acknowledging that the U.S. has been under economic attack and will now fight back. It’s the difference between declaring war before and after Pearl Harbor.

Furthermore, the critique that tariffs will cause inflation to explode do not align with the facts. If tariffs are simply passed on in full to consumers, then why is that not happening now? Why don’tWisconsin dairy farmerssimply pass on to Canadian consumers the 270 percent tariff imposed upon them? Because they would be uncompetitive.
Both economic theory and economic history show tariffs are always at least partly paid for by exporters, not just customers. That is why other nations love imposing heavy tariffs on American industry—it is a way to force U.S. exporters into subsidizing the world.
President Trump and his team understand these dynamics, as well as the fact that the U.S. holds all the cards when negotiating with countries like Canada and Mexico. Nearly all those nations’ exports come to the U.S., while only a few percentage points of American exports go to either Mexico or Canada.
If either of our North American neighbors went toe-to-toe with the U.S. in atrade war, they would take nearly all the losses—and they know it.

Trump understands all these dynamics and is willing to wield the American consumer’s purchasing power like a weapon on the world stage. He is using this leverage to simultaneously level the playing field for American industry, raise revenue, secure investment, boost employment of Americans, and negotiate non-economic issues.
The war’s already started. It’s time to fight back, America.

Is there too much focus on tipping today at restaurants and an array of other outlets and venues? Most Americans think so.
A new survey from WalletHub found that nearly nine in 10 (90%) Americans think the tipping culture has gotten out of hand.
The survey acknowledged that the tipping culture has been ""expanding fast,"" going beyond the nod towaiters, bartendersand hairdressers and now extending to the standard checkout counter.

""More and more establishments where you wouldn't normally tip are asking for something extra at checkout, and people are even being asked to tip self-checkout machines with no human interaction,"" WalletHub noted.
The survey also questioned Americans on their knowledge of why tipping in the U.S. is necessary. Nearly three in five Americans think businesses are replacing employee salaries with customer tips.
When they're presented with a tip suggestion screen, nearly three in 10 Americans tip less, according to a WalletHub survey.(iStock)
Most Americans surveyed (83%) believe automatic service charges should be banned — while more than one in four think tips should continue to be taxed.
When presented with a tip suggestion screen, nearly three in 10 Americans were found to tip less.
Of those surveyed, 40% said they believe tipping should be replaced by an employee rating system that businesses can use to gauge how much to pay their staff.

The survey also found that more than half of Americans leave a tip due to social pressure rather than forgood service.
Additionally, 77% of people think tips should be split only among the employees who interact with customers.
California-based etiquette expert and trainer Rosalinda Oropeza Randall told Fox News Digital that many Americans feel they are asked to tip ""significantly.""
More than half of Americans leave tips because of social pressure rather than to reward good service, a new survey said.(iStock)
""Tipping was reserved for basic, good, and above-and-beyond service,"" she said. ""Now, it has become an automatic addition to the bill.""
She added, ""It is especially awkward when the service provider stands over you watching you press the percentage. Customers can feel pressured into selecting a larger percentage.""
RESTAURANT INSIDERS SHARE THE SECRETS OF SNAGGING HARD-TO-GET RESERVATIONS
Randall commented that tipping 18% has become the minimum, regardless of service quality.
""What if the service was terrible?"" she said. ""Has the customer now become responsible for subsidizing the cost of living or low wages?""
Randall said there's also been a rise in incidental fees, which can leave customers ""frustrated"" and less willing to leave a generous tip.
Extra fees can frustrate customers — making them less willing to leave a good tip, an etiquette expert told Fox News Digital.(iStock)
""We can blame the cost of menu items, services and entertainment prices,"" she said.
""Most customers are willing to tip generously when the experience is positive. Isn't that what we are looking for when we spend our money? A little positivity.""
Randall said that when a service provider shares a ""bad mood, low energy or hate for the job with the customer,"" that person ""shouldn't be surprised when the tip reflects it.""

Although it can be difficult to do so, Randall said she encourages customers to ""calmly and politely"" explain to the server or manager why you may be leaving a small tip, which can be helpful to both.
""Even when service providers are unpleasant, leave at least 10%,"" she also said. ""They did provide you with the bare minimum.""
One expert recommended leaving at least 10% as a tip to a service provider.(iStock)

Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, claimed the Trump administration is spreading ""misinformation"" with the idea that thegovernment is ""too big.""
Kelley appeared on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" on Thursday to comment on a federal judge ordering the Trump administration toreinstate thousands of probationary workerswho lost their jobs from recent mass firings. Kelley’s union was one of the organizations behind the original lawsuit.
Tapper asked Kelley what he would say to critics who were arguing the government is ""too big"" and ""too bloated"" and needs to be cut down. Kelley said the accusation is ""false"" and that the government hasn't grown in decades.

Everett Kelley, the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, appeared on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper.""(CNN screenshot)
""I think that‘s misinformation,"" Kelley said. ""And this administration is very good at putting out false information. The government today is the same size it was in the ‘70s. The population has exploded, but the amount of federal workers has not. So that‘s just false information about it being too big. It‘s the same size as it was in the ’70s.""
Kelley has been a harsh critic of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) efforts to cut federal spending, employees and agencies.
In February, he released a statementcondemning Musk’s demandthat employees list five things they accomplished in the last week or risk losing their jobs.
""It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,"" Kelley said.

John Larson, D-Conn., goes on tirade against Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency during a House Ways and Means Committee markup on Wednesday.
A federal judge ordered theTrump administrationon Thursday to reinstate thousands of probationary workers who were let go in recent mass firings from six different agencies, including the Department of Defense.
The administration is expected to file an appeal against the ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco.
The judge’s order came during a federal court hearing over a lawsuit fromlabor unionsand other groups challenging the mass termination being directed by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).
Those plaintiffs said it violates Administrative Procedure Act requirements and congressional laws that deal with agency hiring and firing practices.

The judge earlier ruled OPM lacked the power to fire workers, including probationary employees who normally have less than a year of civil service on the job.
The agencies affected includeDefense,Agriculture, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.
Alsup appeared incredibly frustrated with the government during the hearing Thursday, saying ""this is a sham"" at least four times.
He added that by not having anyone from OPM there to testify, it was preventing them from getting to the truth.

Alfonso Little, the executive vice president of a local chapter of the American Federation of Government Employees, told Fox News following the hearing Thursday that he thought the judge's ruling was ""outstanding.""
""The judge made a very, very good determination in what was going on with the issues with the probationary employees who were working at different agencies,"" he said. ""I just hope those people who were laid off... I hope they get their jobs back.""
Before issuing his ruling Thursday, Alsup cited a report of an employee for the U.S. Forest Service who was told at the time of her firing that she was let go based on performance, when she actually had a good performance record.
Alsup called it a ""sad, sad day"" when the U.S. government would fire an employee for performance when that is a lie, adding that ""it should have not been done in our country"" and ""it’s a sham.""

""We are grateful for these employees and the critical work they do, and AFGE will keep fighting until all federal employees who were unjustly and illegally fired are given their jobs back.""

Federal agencies are required to submit layoff plans to the White House and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Thursday as theTrump administrationworks to slim down and streamline the federal government.
PresidentDonald Trumpsigned an executive order on Feb. 11 that ordered federal agency leaders to ""undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force."" The order focused on removing employees in offices suspended or closed by the Trump administration, roles that were considered nonessential during government shutdowns and temporary employees.
The executive order stipulated that the layoff plans would not affect roles related to ""public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement.""
On Feb. 26, the Office of Management and Budget and OPM — which works as the federal government’s human resources office — issued guidance to agency heads that they had until March 13 to submit ""Agency Reorganization Plans"" to comply with the large-scale reductions in force order.

Department ofHousing and Urban Development(HUD) Secretary Scott Turner shut down a hurricane relief draft plan put forth by the city of Asheville, North Carolina, that included a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiative that would have prioritized some residents over others, his office said.
""Once again, let me be clear, DEI is dead at HUD,"" Turner said of axing the plan. ""We will not provide funding to any program or grantee that does not comply withPresident Trump’sexecutive orders.""
""HUD looks forward to helping thousands ofNorth Caroliniansrebuild after Hurricane Helene by directing funding assistance to impacted businesses, nonprofit organizations and neighborhoods,"" Turner added. ""However, Asheville’s draft action plan incorporated DEI criteria to prioritize some impacted residents over others, which was unacceptable. After HUD informed Asheville that its plan was unsatisfactory and it would not be approved, the city assured us that it was updating its draft action plan to be compliant.""

HUD was alerted to the language in the draft plan and took appropriate action against it after investigating the matter, Fox News Digital learned.
HUD cited that on PresidentDonald Trump'sfirst day in office, he signed an executive order focused on ""ending radical and wastefulgovernment DEI programs"" and one focused on restoring merit-based opportunity and ""ending illegal discrimination,"" which ended DEI practices at the federal level in favor of merit-based systems.
""At HUD, we are taking a detailed and deliberate approach in every aspect of our work to ensure we are serving all communities regardless of race, color, or creed,"" Turner said in a comment Wednesday to Fox News Digital. ""Let this send a clear message that no detail will go unnoticed, adherence to President Trump’s Executive Orders is mandatory. We appreciate that Asheville has reversed course and is now working with us to get this right.""
Democratic Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said in comments provided to Fox News Digital that the city was ""working closely with HUD as we continue to navigate the changing compliance requirements of the new administration.""
""We are grateful for the administration’s support in our recovery efforts,"" Manheimer continued. ""The City will ensure it meets current federal standards in order to facilitate approval of critically needed funding to help the city recover from the devastation of Tropical Storm Helene.""
The city released an updated draft on Monday that did not include a section on prioritizing minority- and women-owned businesses, Fox New Digital found.

When it comes to his overall approval rating, Trump has seen his numbers edge down slightly since returning to the White House in late January, when an average of his polls indicated the president's approval rating in the low 50s and his disapproval in the mid 40s. An average of the latest surveys indicates he is hovering slightly above water.
While Americans are split on Trump's performance, the approval ratings for his second term are an improvement from his first tour of duty, when he started 2017 in negative territory and remained underwater throughout his four-year tenure inthe White House.

When asked onFox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures""by host Maria Bartiromo whether he expected there would be a recession this year, the president responded, ""I hate to predict things like that.""
""There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,"" Trump said as he referred to his agenda, which includes tariffs.
""It takes a little time,"" Trump said before predicting that his economic agenda ""should be great for us.""
While aking questions Tuesday amid another down day for the nation's financial markets, Trump said ""You're going to have drops and markets are going to go up and they're gonna go down.""
Trump's predecessor in the White House, former President Joe Biden, was dogged by inflation during his tenure.
Biden's approval rating hovered in the low-to-mid-50s during the first six months of his single term as president, with his disapproval in the upper 30s to the low- to-mid-40s.

However, Biden's numbers sank into negative territory in the late summer and autumn of 2021, in the wake of his much-criticized handling of the turbulent U.S. exit from Afghanistan, a surge of migrants crossing into the U.S. along the nation's southern border with Mexico, and amid soaring inflation.
Biden's approval ratings stayed underwater throughout the rest of his presidency, as high prices for goods remained a top concern on the minds of American voters.

Navarro attempted to ignore the reporter, who identified himself as working for Sky News UK, until he called it a ""fact"" that Trump was ""changing his mind every single day"" on tariffs.
""It’s a negotiation, my friend,"" Navarro repeated as they began speaking over each other.
""Right. So he doesn’t mean it? So it’s all part of the negotiation? And it’s causing havoc to the stock markets,"" the reporter remarked.
""It’s not causing havoc,"" Navarro insisted.
""Well, it is, they are tumbling,"" the reporter argued.

Other members of the press began shouting questions, leading to Navarro demanding they ""back up"" and ""stop.""
""I’m allowed to ask questions for folks who weren’t out here. Do you not believe that it’s causing havoc for the stock market?"" the reporter could be heard asking.
""Because here’s what we can do,"" Navarro answered, warning all the reporters. ""I can either stay here and answer your questions, and you can be civil about it. Or you can hector me like this. So stand back. Get that thing out of my face. You’ve had your chance to ask questions. I will answer some other questions.""
Navarro then took a question from another reporter.

After Massachusetts authoritiesreleased a reportshowing a sharp rise inflavored cigarette and vapeseizures under a recent bipartisan statewide ban, a former ATF official and a network of law enforcement veterans specializing in contraband called into question why the ban remains.
An annual multi-agency report from the Bay State’s Illegal Tobacco Task Force showed vape seizures up by more than 200,000 – largely due to large-scale seizures – since 2023, while smokeless tobacco and standard cigarette seizures were down.
Calculations by the Tobacco Law Enforcement Network found that Massachusetts police seized 279,432 vape units in fiscal year 2024, up from about 1,300 the year prior.
Former New York City Sheriff Edgar Domenech, who is also a former ATF official who focused on tobacco and related contraband, told Fox News Digital the findings showed the illegal vape market is ""exploding,"" and that when the Bay State became the first to outlaw flavored tobacco, it was a clarion call for cartels and smugglers to say, ""[we’re] open for business.""
MIGRANT CRISIS ROILS BOSTON AREA AS SCHOOL STANDS FIRM ON RESIDENCY POLICY
""A 21,000 percent increase in smuggling proves once and for all that the Massachusetts flavor ban experiment has been an embarrassing catastrophe,"" said Domenech, who had been appointed to his Big Apple post by then-Republican Mayor Michael Bloomberg and now works with Georgetown University.
""They are spending so much time seizing so much product they literally can’t find a place to store the contraband,"" he said.
While the rule of law is important, sometimes new laws themselves may need revisiting, he suggested.
Without the ability to levy taxes on what is now an illegal product that remains ubiquitous elsewhere in New England, bordering states like New Hampshire – less than an hourfrom Boston– seek to reap the tax benefits of Massachusetts’ ban as customers go a little out of their way to buy their products, he said.
Prohibiting adultproducts like vapes""never works,"" Domenech added. ""It moves sales out of the stores and into the streets.""
RAMASWAMY MOCKS MASS GOVERNOR'S ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT STANCE AFTER FLIP: ‘NOW ACCEPTABLE TO COMPLAIN’
In January, Boston police in the Drug Control Unit arrested a 58-year-old Dorchester man as part of a raid that netted 50 grams of crack and 700 packages of ""illegally possessed unstamped menthol cigarettes."" The man, Parrish Jones, was charged with trafficking cigarettes.
Separately, a Hopkinton man was arrested in June for allegedly failing to pay nearly $500,000 in excise taxes after he allegedly sought out-of-state distributors in order to market vape-type products, according to FOX Boston.
The ban itself went into effect in December 2019, as the Massachusetts Public Health Council enacted new sales restrictions on vapes and flavored tobacco.
The panel was able to do so after then-Gov. Charles Baker – a Republican – signed a bill from the Democratic legislature ""modernizing tobacco control.""

More recently, the Massachusetts attorney general’s office filed a complaint against a vape company in 2024 for allegedly ignoring the flavored tobacco ban. The office previously sued several other companies as well, according to a statement.
In November, several Massachusetts lawmakers announced plans to file legislation this year to phase out all tobacco and nicotine sales in the state, beginning with those Bay Staters who are currently underage to begin with.
Sen. Jason Lewis, D-Middlesex, Rep. Kate Lipper-Garabedian, D-Melrose, and Rep. Tommy Vitolo, D-Brookline, are collaborating on the bill, according to NBC Boston.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/failing-response-bird-flu-hurting-farmers-consumers,A failing response to bird flu is hurting farmers and consumers,"Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel weighs in on how concerned people should be about bird flu spreading on 'Fox Report.'
The highly pathogenic avian influenza – commonly known as bird flu – is wreaking havoc onAmerican agriculture. This devastating virus, carried by birds worldwide, is currently spreading among U.S. poultry and dairy cattle, with several recent human cases reported among dairy and poultry workers.
Since the outbreak began in 2022, more than 162 million birds have been culled. In the past 30 days alone,bird flu has been detectedin 24 states. The virus has been confirmed in poultry in all 50 states and, as of December 2024, dairy cattle infections have been reported in 16 states.
The situation is worsening. Herd, flock and human infections have risen, farmers are grappling with market uncertainty, and consumer prices continue to rise. The economic impact of this outbreak is staggering, threatening farmers’ livelihoods across the country.

In the last quarter alone, more than 20 million egg-laying chickens in the United States have died due to bird flu, causing the conventional egg-laying flock to shrink by nearly 4% in January. The federal government has spent more than $1.25 billion compensating farmers for their losses. Yet, despite these efforts, the crisis remains unchecked.
SMART POLICY AND CHEAPER EGGS: TRUMP-ROLLINS TEAM GOOD FOR FARMERS AND US CONSUMERS
Rather than responding with urgency and competence, the federal government’s actions have been inadequate. In recent weeks, theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)has made sweeping cuts to the federal workforce, dismissing key personnel tasked with public health and disease control.
While improving government efficiency is an important goal, the indiscriminate mass firing of federal workers, specifically those focused on protecting the health and safety of Americans, is not the solution. In fact, it is reckless and dangerous.
Reports indicate that among DOGE’s first targets at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were Ph.D.-trained scientists who assist state and local officials in responding to disease outbreaks. Others dismissed from the CDC included fellows in the Laboratory Leadership Service, who develop tests for new and emerging diseases and often collaborate with the Epidemic Intelligence Service on outbreak responses.
At a time when public health efforts should be strengthened, the Trump administration’s federal workforce cuts are undermining our ability to combat the bird flu crisis.
NEW BIRD FLU STRAIN DETECTED IN NEVADA DAIRY WORKER, CDC SAYS
The damage extendsto the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), where microbiologists specializing in animal disease mitigation – including bird flu – were fired from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. On Feb. 18, USDA publicly acknowledged mistakenly terminating Food Safety and Inspection Service staff responsible for bird flu control and mitigation.
USDA stated that it is ""working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters."" It is unacceptable for this administration to ""accidentally"" fire essential personnel tasked with containing this virus and safeguarding lives and livelihoods in rural America.
The consequences of this mismanagement are already hitting American consumers. Egg prices soared by 37% in 2024, far outpacing the overall food inflation rate of 2.5%. In January of this year alone, egg prices jumped more than 22%, reaching an all-time high of $7.09 per dozen. Projections suggest prices could reach nearly $10 per dozen by the end of the year.

Unfortunately, USDASecretary Brooke Rollins’ most recent comments have provided little reassurance, such as suggesting people should raise chickens in their own backyard. This is neither helpful, nor safe – it’s absurd. So far, none of her proposed plans adequately address the squeeze farmers and consumers are facing right now.
Importing additional eggs is not a reliable form of price stabilization, especially considering the 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico that continue to loom over the economy.. In 2023, the United States imported $44.1 million worth of eggs from Canada – more than 40% of all egg imports to the United States. Imposing tariffs on a reliable trading partner who makes up a significant portion of existing imports is not going to translate into better prices for consumers, and it certainly won’t improve conditions for U.S. egg producers.
Further, $500 million to address biosecurity gaps is important, but farmers will still bear some of the cost while continuing to lose their hens and chickens. I’m deeply concerned that this plan will impose further costs on farmers who are in an already dire situation, and many may not be able to enter this voluntary program due to the cost.

The federal response to this crisis has fallen short at the expense of our agricultural producers and American consumers. Instead of taking decisive action on Day 1 to curb the spread of bird flu or mitigating its cascading impact on our food supply chain, this administration’s actions risk exacerbating the crisis.
As a member of Congress representing working-class families in rural America, I stand ready to work with the president, Secretary Rollins, and the rest of theTrump administrationto implement a comprehensive strategy to contain this virus, stabilize the farm economy, and lower food prices for working families across our country, and I hope the administration will be willing to rise to the challenge.

I know what it’s like to grow up in a household where a steady paycheck means everything. My mother, a nurse in Miami, worked long shifts to keep me and my brother fed, housed andhopeful for a better future.
Families like ours didn’t have safety nets – we had paychecks. When money was tight, sacrifices were made. That’s why it’s infuriating to watch PresidentDonald Trumpthreaten the livelihoods of tens of thousands of federal workers, treating them like numbers on a spreadsheet instead of real people with real families to feed.
Federal employees aren’t nameless bureaucrats sitting behind desks in Washington. They’re the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) crisis hotline workers talking a veteran off the ledge.

PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS: HOW TRUMP'S TEAM CAN FULFILL HIS PROMISE
These are the people Trump wants to lay off – people who have dedicated their lives to public service only to be told they’re expendable. Many live outside our nation’s capital and are the neighbors, relatives, friends and associates of everyday folks making up our great country.
Take Maria Alvarez, a single mother in Virginia who’s worked for the Department of Housing and Urban Development for more than a decade. She helps low-income families navigate the federal housing system so they can access the American dream of owning a home. ""I’ve given my life to public service,"" Alvarez told ABC News. ""And this is how we’re repaid?""
She’s not alone. Thousands ofdedicated federal workersare now wondering how they’ll pay their mortgages, afford childcare and put food on the table.
TRUMP’S 'CHINA FIRST' RECORD: SELLING THE WEST’S ECONOMY AND NATIONAL SECURITY OUT TO BEIJING
And it’s not just them who will suffer. Layoffs at the the VA will gut the agency’s suicide prevention hotline, alifeline for struggling veterans. If you’ve ever spoken to someone who has served in combat, you know these services are crucial. When our troops return home, many carry wounds that aren’t visible.
Thanks to Trump’s cuts, some may call for help only to find no one on the other end of the line.
Meanwhile, cuts to the Department of Education will leave underfunded schools with even fewer resources. America’s public school classroom educators – already stretched thin – will lose critical federal support for special education, school lunch programs and low-income student assistance.
Growing up, I knew plenty of kids who depended on those programs to get by. Trump’s decision will hurt them the most.
But this isn’t just a moral failure – it’s an economic disaster waiting to happen.
DEMOCRATS, GET OVER THE OBAMA COALITION. TIME TO GROW ANEW
Every first-year economics student learns that government spending is crucial to GDP. The federal government plays an outsized role in stabilizing the economy, not just through direct employment but investments in infrastructure, public services and research. Slashing that spending – especially through mass layoffs – weakens the entire economic foundation.
Federal jobs injectmoney into local economies, fund essential programs and drive broader economic growth. Cutting them so dramatically could stall government input into GDP, leaving a hole that private industry won’t quickly fill.
All of this is happening while Trump’s pending trade wars with Canada and Mexico are hurting businesses that rely on cross-border commerce. Agriculture, manufacturing and transportation industries are bracing for higher costs and supply chain disruptions.
Add in thousands of newly unemployed government workers, and you have the perfect recipe for economic stagnation. Instead of strengthening the economy, Trump’s policies actively weaken it.

If cutting government spending helped the economy, we’d be seeing results by now. But we’re not.Inflation is still hittingAmerican families, wages aren’t keeping up and the cost of living continues to climb. Laying off thousands of workers in the middle of this crisis isn’t just cruel – it’s bad economics.
Growing up, my mother always said, ""A budget reflects your values."" If you care about something, you invest in it. If you don’t, you cut it.
Right now, Trump’s priorities couldn’t be clearer – mass layoffs for working people and more money for the wealthiest among us. That’s not leadership. That’s not ""America First."" That’s a betrayal of the very people who make this country work.

The federal workforce doesn’t deserve to be treated like a political bargaining chip. These are real people, doing real jobs, serving real communities. If Trump truly cared about the American worker, he’d be fighting toprotect their jobs, not cutting them loose.
At the end of the day, a government that abandons its workers abandons its people, and we should all be outraged.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavittsparred with an Associated Press reporter Tuesday over what she deemed an ""insulting"" question ""trying to test [her] knowledge of economics.""
AP's Josh Boak asked about President Donald Trump's address at the Business Roundtable (BRT) quarterly meeting that was set to occur after the White House press briefing. He claimed that despite Trump previously touting tax cuts duringhis last BRT meeting in 2024, the president is now pushing ""tax hikes"" through tariffs.
Leavitt objected to this line of questioning, interrupting him, saying, ""Not true.""
""I’m curious why he is prioritizing that over tax cuts,"" Boak said as Leavitt responded, ""He is not doing that.""

""He is actually not implementing tax hikes,"" Leavitt said. ""Tariffs are a tax hike on foreign countries that, again, have been ripping us off. Tariffs are a tax cut for the American people, and the president is a staunch advocate of tax cuts.""
""As you know, he campaigned on no taxes on tips, no taxes on overtime, no taxes on Social Security benefits. He has committed to all three of those things, and he expects Congress to pass them later this year,"" she added.
""I’m sorry, have you paid a tariff? Because I have,"" Boak responded. ""They don’t get charged on foreign companies. They get charged on the importers.""

""And ultimately, when we have fair and balanced trade, which the American people have not seen in decades, as I said at the beginning, revenues will stay here, wages will go up, and our country will be made wealthy again,"" Leavitt said.
""And I think it’s insulting that you are trying to test my knowledge of economics and the decisions that this president has made. I now regret giving a question to the Associated Press,"" she said, moving on to another reporter.

American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten appeared to change her tune on the Department of Education Saturday, getting heated over the prospect of its elimination after previously seeming indifferent.
PresidentDonald Trump, who campaigned on dismantling the Education Department during the 2024 presidential election, is expected to issue an executive order calling on the new Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon, to start the process of abolishing the agency.
The union head was very animated in an MSNBC interview with Katie Phang when asked about Trump moving to shut down the department, saying, ""It's a disaster symbolically as much as a disaster in reality.""
Weingarten argued the importance of theDepartment of Educationcomes from its implementation of programs like Title I, which supports funding for students who are underachieving in areas with high poverty, and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), a federal law that gives disabled children a free education that is tailored to their needs.

She also tied it to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI), another target of the Trump administration.
The true meaning of DEI is ""opportunity,"" Weingarten said, growing increasingly agitated. ""It’s so we can create that ladder of opportunity. It’s so we can make sure that kids can succeed. Poor kids, kids with disabilities, kids who want to go to career, tech ed, kids who are first generation college goers to get some scholarship money. That’s what the Department of Education does.""
""That is why so many people are so mad about it,"" she insisted, getting heated. ""Because they’re just taking opportunity away from kids that don’t have it. So billionaires - kids of billionaires, they have it, they go to private schools. Everyone else, 90% go to public schools. Don’t take away their opportunity.""
""Sorry, I’m really angry about this … I’m really angry,"" Weingarten said.

However, shortly after Trump won in November, Weingarten seemed to have a different opinion when asked about the president-elect's pledge to eliminate the Education Department.
""I mean, my members don't really care about whether they have a bureaucracy of the Department of Education or not,""Weingarten saidduring an appearance on MSNBC. ""In fact, Al Shanker and the [American Federation of Teachers] in the 1970s were opposed to its creation.""
When Fox News Digital reached out to Weingarten for further comment Monday, she said, ""It’s the cuts to programs we are very upset about- the cuts directly to programs that affect children with disabilities and children who are poor.""

School choice proponent Corey DeAngelis responded to Weingarten's comments on MSNBC, tellingFox News Digital, ""Why wasn't Randi Weingarten angry about years of school closures in union-controlled districts? Why wasn't she angry about the latest Nation's Report Card scores showing decades of learning loss? Her priorities are all messed up. She sees the school system as a jobs program for adults instead of an education initiative for kids.""

New Yorkofficials fired more than 2,000 prison guards on Monday for not returning to work after a weekslong strike.
Enough correctional officers had returned to work for the state to declare an end to the wildcat strike, a labor action that violated a state law prohibiting strikes by most public employees.
""After 22 days of an illegal strike, the governor and I are happy to report it is now ended,"" Corrections Commissioner Daniel Martuscello said during a virtual press briefing.
The state and theguards’ union, the New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Association, reached a new deal to end the strike over the weekend, but it was contingent on at least 85% of staff returning to work by Monday morning. While the 85% goal was not met, Martuscello said the state would honor some of the agreement's provisions, including on overtime work.

Martuscello said the National Guard would remain in place at prisons to support staff while the department pursues an aggressive recruiting campaign to bring in additional employees. Gov. Kathy Hochul had deployed the National Guard to some prisons to fill in for striking workers.
About 10,000 security staff are available to work in prisons across the state, down from about 13,500 before the wildcat strike, the commissioner said.
""Termination letters have been sent to over 2,000 officers who remained on strike. Officers and sergeants who did not have preapproved medical leave and didn’t return by this morning, 6:45 a.m. deadline, have been terminated effective immediately,"" Martuscello said.
Guards frustrated over working conditions began walking off the job on Feb. 17 at many state prisons. Inmates have complained about deteriorating conditions behind bars since the walkout.

A special prosecutor is alsoprobing the March 1 deathof an inmate, 22-year-old Messiah Nantwi, at Mid-State Correctional Facility. Other inmates said Nantwi was brutally beaten by correctional officers, and 15 staffers have been placed on administrative leave after the inmate's death.
According to a court filing by the state attorney general's office, there is ""probable cause to believe"" that as many as nine correctional officers either caused or could be implicated in Nantwi's death.
Mid-State is across the street from the Marcy Correctional Facility, where six guards have been charged with murder in the December beating death of Robert Brooks.
Another inmate, 61-year-old Jonathon Grant, was pronounced dead last month after he was found unresponsive in his cell at the Auburn Correctional Facility amid the ongoing labor strike, although it is unclear if prison staffing played a role in his death.

The strike was not sanctioned by the officers' union.
Two previous deals that sought to end the strike failed to bring back enough guards to declare an end to the labor action.
As was included in the previous agreements, the deal reached over the weekend addresses a key complaint of the guards by issuing a 90-day suspension of a provision of a state law that limits the use of solitary confinement. During the pause, the state will evaluate if reinstating the law would create an unreasonable risk to staff and inmate safety.
Guards will also work 12-hour shifts and the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision will not discipline officers who participated in the strike if they returned by the Monday deadline.

Teachers' union boss Randi Weingarten said during a recent podcast appearance that she is fearful PresidentDonald Trump'splans to terminate the Department of Education will mean more funding for school choice vouchers, which she decried as a ""tax credit"" for wealthy families already sending their kids to private school.
Weingarten's comments came during a podcast interview with Molly Jong-Fast, who spoke with her about the implications of Trump's spending reforms, particularly his plan to terminate the Department of Education. Weingarten stated that cutting the department's roughly $100 billion in funding will primarily benefit tax cuts for the wealthy or – ""equally pernicious"" – be redirected to states as ""block grants.""
""We know, for example, whatTexaswould do,"" Weingarten told Jong-Fast. ""They'll use it for vouchers. So they won't give [federal funding] to the kids who have it now, they'll just give it for vouchers.""

""And frankly, what we are seeing in all the programs now – in terms of vouchers – they don't work for kids,"" Weingarten continued. ""They basically go right now – it becomes a tax credit for people who already are sending their kids to private schools. So it's income redistribution.""

Trump has not taken any formal action to dismantle the the department, butmedia reportshave signaled he is close to signing an executive order directing his education secretary, Linda McMahon, to begin the process. Last month, the president mused during a press conference from the Oval Office that the Education Department was ""a big con job"" that needed to be shut down ""immediately.""
Alongside his anticipated executive action to dismantle the department Trump issued an executive order on Jan. 29 to expand ""educational freedom"" for families through various school choice programs, including vouchers.
""We're fighting to protect our kids and protect that funding and not let Donald Trump or Elon Musk glom it off for tax cuts for billionaires or for block grants for vouchers,"" Weingarten responded after Jong-Fast asked what she and her union, the American Federation of Teachers, was doing to combat Trump. Weingarten added that regardless of whether you are a Republican or Democrat, ensuring American families have the economic and educational opportunities to achieve the American Dream, should be a priority.

However, while Weingarten may be of the belief that school choice funding, in particular for vouchers, does not benefit the economic andeducational opportunitiesof Americans, others disagree with that notion.
Rachel Langan, a senior education policy analyst at the Commonwealth Foundation, a public policy think-tank based in Pennsylvania, said ""simply spending more money"" is not an answer to the deficiencies within the U.S. education system.
""Pennsylvania already dedicates more than $37 billion to public schools, more than $22,000 per student. Yet, the latestU.S. Department of Educationdata shows that 69% of Pennsylvania eighth-grade students aren’t proficient at math, and an equal 69% cannot read at grade level – despite a $4.1 billion increase in state education spending in the last four years,"" Langan said in a statement following Trump's executive order directing the federal government to prioritize school choice funding.

In a seemingly peculiar bipartisan alliance, conservative House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, R-Fla., and Congressional Progressive Caucus member Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., teamed up to push a measure that would cap credit card interest rates at 10%.
""The annual percentage rate applicable to an extension of credit obtained by use of a credit card may not exceed 10 percentage points, inclusive of all finance charges,"" the proposal stipulates.
Responding to a post on X that labeled Luna and her left-leaning compatriot ""strange bedfellows,"" the GOP congresswoman noted, ""I would argue it isn’t strange at all. Most people agree insane credit card interest rates are predatory.""

PresidentDonald Trumpsaid the U.S. has ""just about"" lifted the intelligence pause on Ukraine, adding that his administration has to do anything it can to get Ukrainians serious about making a deal to end the war with Russia.
""You know, I say they don’t have the cards. Nobody really has the cards,"" Trump told reporters during a gaggle on Air Force One on Sunday evening. ""Russia doesn’t have the cards…What you have to do is you have to make a deal, and you have to stop the killing. It’s a senseless war, and we’re going to get it stopped.""
On Friday, Fox News Digital learned from three sources familiar with the situation that the U.S. was continuing to share some defensive intelligence with Ukraine to protect it against incoming Russian strikes.
Federal intelligence, the work of the CIA, FBI and human intelligence, and data that helps with offensive Ukrainian strikes against Russia had already been paused.

""We, we just about have. I mean, we really just about have,"" he said. ""And we want to do anything we can to get Ukraine to be serious about getting something done.""
Trump also noted that he thinksUkraine will signthe minerals deal, but he wants them to want peace at the moment.

When asked how Ukraine should show it wants peace, Trump said they have not shown it to the extent he thinks they should.
""I think right now they haven’t, but I think they will be, and I think it’s going to become evident over the next two or three days,"" the president said, adding that we have to have peace over anything. ""This week, hundreds of people died in cities in Ukraine, and we got to get it stopped. It would have never happened if I was president.""
During the nearly 10-minute gaggle with reporters, Trump fielded questions on a variety of topics, including the types of sanctions or tariffs he mayimpose on Russia.

""We’ll see if we can get something done,"" Trump said. ""A lot of people died this week, as you know, in Ukraine – not only Ukrainians but Russians. So, I think everybody wants to see it get done. We’re going to make a lot of progress, I believe, this week.""
Trump was also asked what he would say to Americans watching their retirement accounts freefall from their highest in years amidconcerns about tariffs.

The tariffs, Trump explained, will bring companies and factories back, noting that 90,000 factories in the U.S. had closed since the beginning of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between the U.S., Canada and Mexico, which was in effect from 1994 to 2020.

President Donald Trumphas used his new powers to dismiss a slew of lawsuits filed under former President Joe Biden, including challenges to state abortion bans, allegations of racism in police and fire departments, environmental and anti-whistleblower cases, and various business-related disputes. Meanwhile, he has largely left Biden-era antitrust lawsuits untouched.
The Trump administration took steps as recently as this week to drop a lawsuit challenging Idaho'sabortion banthat only permits the procedures when necessary to save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest. The Biden administration tried to circumvent the state ban with its lawsuit that argued the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) required doctors to provide abortions in cases when they are needed to prevent serious health consequences, not just the life of the mother.
""Democrats’ abortion extremism cost them the election,"" said Katie Daniel, Director of Legal Affairs & Policy Counsel at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America. ""With President Trump and a new administration in charge, Biden’s weaponization of the federal government is over — no more lawfare. The will of the people is clear and activist judges must not interfere.""

Multiple federal civil rights cases revolving around hiring discrimination have also been dropped under Trump. TheDepartment of Justice (DOJ)said it intends to drop a 2023 case alleging anti-immigrant hiring practices at Elon Musk's SpaceX. Additionally, several federal civil rights lawsuits accusing police and fire departments of racial discrimination based on their provision of certain physical fitness tests and other requirements like credit checks have also been dropped.
""American communities deserve firefighters and police officers to be chosen for their skill and dedication to public safety — not to meetDEI quotas,""U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement after dismissing the lawsuits that had been levied against multiple jurisdictions around the country.

A former DOJ civil rights attorney, Heritage Foundation Senior Legal Fellow Hans von Spakovsky said that in one of the cases against a fire department in Cobb County, Georgia, a judge refused to grant a settlement proposed by theBiden administrationdue to a lack of evidence proving physical fitness tests and credit report checks are racially discriminatory toward minorities. Spakovsky noted that settlements are typically approved by judges, but the one in Cobb County sought to set up racial hiring quotas that the judge likened to ""a racial spoils system,"" he said.
""Here's a direct quote from the judge: ‘The court will not approve of an agreement which may violate the rights of others without a sufficient evidentiary basis to show that such race-based action is warranted,’"" Spakovsky said.
""The broad scope of all of these dropped civil rights cases,"" he concluded, ""is that they are throwing out the ones — in my opinion — that call on defendants to violate federal laws against discrimination.""

Two other high-profile lawsuits recently dropped by the Trump administration include a Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency case against local Louisiana regulators and the synthetic rubber manufacturer Denka, which alleged failure to adequately protect the predominantly minority community near its plant from cancer risks linked to air pollution.
Another dropped case involved a medical whistleblower,Dr. Eithan Haim,who faced prosecution from Biden's DOJ after he leaked documents to the media revealing Texas Children's Hospital in Houston was performing transgender medical procedures on minors, even after it said it had stopped complying with new state regulations.
Dr. Phil spoke with multiple whistleblowers who were sounding the alarm about transgender procedures' impact on youth. Among them was Dr. Eithan Haim, who faced prosecution from former President Joe Biden's DOJ after he leaked documents to the media revealing Texas Children's Hospital in Houston was performing transgender medical procedures on minors, even after it said it had stopped to comply with new state regulations.
Trump has also dropped a number of consumer protection andcryptocurrency lawsuits,but has done little in the way of disrupting the Biden administration's antitrust enforcement, something tech professionals were expecting after the last administration challenged Big Tech companies aggressively for allegedly building monopolies.
""It's a big plus for the crypto and fintech sector as a whole, because you just see them celebrating, like you see social posts online of a lot of these executives at those companies that just missed lawsuits who are really happy,"" said Kison Patel, a financial tech entrepreneur and the host of ""M&A Science,"" a podcast about mergers and acquisitions. ""It seems like there's going to be less scrutiny and regulations around that sector.""

Patel added that while mergers and acquisitions were expected to ramp up this year, he isn't so sure anymore considering the approach Trump has signaled towards antitrust enforcement.
""I think there's still a lot to watch in the antitrust area,"" said Patel, who pointed to a new case the Federal Trade Commission has brought against a medical device company on antitrust grounds. ""But, the take home is there doesn't appear to be a big shift in position in the realm of regulations around antitrust.""

Farmers and ranchers feed the world and save the planet – it’s a calling that deserves to be celebrated. But it’s time foragriculture in Americato be honest with ourselves: for too long we have settled for the status quo.
With PresidentDonald Trumpback in office, there’s never been a better opportunity for producers to grow our successes and capitalize on this moment – setting up generations to come with opportunity and sustainability.
The avian flu outbreak is a crisis in agriculture, and the cost of eggs is a nightmare for consumers. Unfortunately, we’re in a ""break glass in case of emergency"" situation – and the strategies employed under the Biden administration simply weren’t good enough, leading us to where we are today.
Part of the administration's plan is partnering with countries around the world to import eggs, as a short-term solution to lower costs.(iStock)

Not even two weeks into the job,Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollinslaid out a thoughtful, comprehensive five-point plan to help guide American producers and families through this time.

As a farmer and veterinarian who grew a business raising livestock, managing disease and outbreaks – like we’re seeing withavian flu– is a critical part of the job. These animals are our livelihood, and it’s our responsibility to care for them, ensuring that we’re raising and producing the highest quality, safest food on the market for our consumers.
PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS: HOW TRUMP'S TEAM CAN FULFILL HIS PROMISE
I’m willing to bet the farm that this is just the first example we’re going to see of President Trump and Secretary Rollins going to bat for America’s farmers and ranchers. They have our backs and are listening to our voices. We’re going to see a whole bunch more smart, forward-thinking policy that will make a huge difference for agriculture and our nation.
Washington knows there’s much to do: We need to fix trade imbalances and grow markets. We need to invest in more and better research. We need to stabilize rising input costs and increase farm income. We need to build better plans to combat devastating disease outbreaks. We need to address labor shortages. We need to understand how we canimplement new technologies, while also protecting our data. That’s just the start, but we know this administration is ready to kick some butt.

Nebraska’s fields and pasture lands are expansive – about 90% of our land is devoted to farming and ranching. I’ve seen it firsthand: as rural goes, so goes agriculture. Secretary Rollins believes this, and she is an advocate for us. I’ve heard her articulate a vision for rural economic prosperity and development that will go a long way in giving our families and communities a boost.
We need to work with our federal partners to help build this roadmap for American agriculture. We know our potential is second to none. We have the best people and plentiful water, crops, and livestock.  With great optimism and renewed partnerships, this season of leadership and newfound opportunity will lead to a long-lasting period of abundance –and cheaper eggs– for the American people.

Tim Walz as her vice president.
With DOGE scrutinizing the federal workforce for cuts, one potential 2028 Democrat hopeful issued an executive order aiming to fill hundreds of vacancies in his own state government while also focusing on private-sector openings.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapirowas joined by other dignitaries during a job fair at the state Farm Show complex in Harrisburg to sign the order calling for, among other things, federal bureaucrats to be considered for a plethora of job openings in Harrisburg's civil service.
""The commonwealth recognizes that a workforce of dedicated and talented public servants is the backbone of a responsive government that can ensure the efficient and effective delivery of services for Pennsylvanians,"" Shapiro said in his order.
The executive order seeks to ""capitalize on federal layoffs by accepting federal work experience as equivalent to state experience for the state’s top recruitment needs,"" according to a separate statement from Shapiro.
Gov. Josh Shapiro(AP/File)
The statement added there will be an emphasis on veterans and military servicemembers also having direct access to recruiter-contacts, as well as publication of the 23 highest-priority, hardest-to-fill state jobs.
""It is imperative that the commonwealth attract and retain qualified employees who are drawn to a career in public service to fill its existing vacancies,"" the order reads, citing an estimated 103,700 Pennsylvanians employed by the feds in 2024.
Pennsylvania Secretary of Administration Neil Weaver added in a statement that the federal workforce is ""one of the most professional and qualified in the world, and we know that many federal jobs have similar duties to jobs performed by Commonwealth employees.""
TOP BLUE STATE REPUBLICAN LAUNCHES COMPREHENSIVE DOGE EFFORT WITH A TWIST
""This executive order will help individuals with federal work experience find relevant job opportunities, continue their public service careers, and put their skills to work for the people of Pennsylvania,"" Weaver said.
While Shapiro’s order aims to encourage qualified federal workers to relocate up I-83 to Harrisburg, a source familiar with his efforts noted that the governor remains committed to an all-encompassing strategy to attract top talent to Pennsylvania’s public and private sectors.
SHAPIRO, STITT SAY SLASHING ENERGY DEVELOPMENT RED-TAPE AND BEATING CHINA IN ‘AI ARMS RACE’ ARE TOP PRIORITIES
The day before he issued his order focused on state government jobs, Shapiro was in Pittsburgh meeting with private-sector leaders at the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, seeking to boost economic growth in western Pennsylvania.
There, Shapiro spoke about his energy ""lightning plan"" to increase jobs while reducing costs, saying, ""We haven’t done anything meaningful onenergy generationsince the [Ed] Rendell administration: It’s time for us to lead again.""
Shapiro also held a phone call with tech billionaire Elon Musk in October. The governor said neither of them discussed politics but instead investment in Pennsylvania.
In the past, a source familiar with the Shapiro administration’s work suggested he bore the mantle of increasing government efficiency before the Trump-Musk endeavor to cut federal government waste began, given his unofficial and oft-repeated slogan: ""Get s--t done.""
Conservatives, however, swiftly criticized Shapiro’s order, with the state House minority leader suggesting any vacant government jobs first be deemed necessary to begin with.
""While President Trump is using his mandate to lead the federal government in an unprecedented effort to right-size itself in true responsibility to the taxpayers, finding ways to add to our bureaucracy here in Pennsylvania sends us in the wrong direction,"" said state Rep. Jesse Topper, R-McConnellsburg.

""When a job becomes vacant in Pennsylvania’s administrative apparatus, the question should first be asked if it is truly needed rather than how quickly it can be filled,"" Topper continued, adding that the focus should be on ""state-specific ways to get our fiscal house in order.""
Meanwhile, a potential 2026 Shapiro opponent said the governor’s order will ""make living in Pennsylvania worse.""
""He's already proposed an unsustainable, job-killing $51 billion budget, and yet that's not enough for him,"" said state Sen. Doug Mastriano, R-Gettysburg.
""Now he wants to continue his spending spree with this grandstanding, desperately trying to draw attention to himself politically. Meanwhile, he doesn't bat an eye as he destroys Pennsylvania's economy and ruins the lives and livelihood of our families.""
Mastriano notablylaunched an effort last weekto establish Pennsylvania's own version of the federal Department of Government Efficiency.

President Donald Trump's Labor secretary nominee,Lori Chavez-DeRemer, advanced past her last procedural vote on Thursday, teeing up a final confirmation vote next week.
The nominee easily got past the last hurdle by a 66-30 bipartisan vote. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., voted against the motion, the only Republican to do so.
Chavez-DeRemer is now one step closer to becoming the secretary of the Department of Labor, and she will face a final vote on Monday.

Several Democrats ended up voting to move the Trump nominee forward, including Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado, Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, Ruben Gallego of Arizona, Maggie Hassan and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia, Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia, Gary Peters and Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, Adam Schiff of California and Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.
She recently managed to get past the key Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) with bipartisan backing. There was initially some uncertainty whether her nomination would be reported out favorably, as Paul had pledged to oppose her.
Chavez-DeRemer ultimately received 14 votes to advance from the committee last month, with nine senators opposing.
Sheearned the votesof Hassan, Hickenlooper and Kaine, in addition to nearly all Republicans, except for Paul.
In a previous statement announcing her support prior to the committee vote, Hassan said, ""The Department of Labor plays an integral role in supporting workers and small businesses alike, and after hearing significant support from constituents, including members of labor unions in New Hampshire, I will support Representative Chavez-DeRemer's nomination as Secretary of Labor.""

Virginia officials hosted a virtual statewide hiring event Wednesday, showcasing at least 10,000 job openings, asGov. Glenn Youngkincontinues to support President Donald Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) agenda while offering empathy for people in his state who are affected.
""Virginia is open for business and ready to help you succeed: offering opportunities for anyone navigating a career transition,"" Youngkin said of the initiative.
""Your experience is invaluable, your skills are transferable, and you have access to a broad range of job opportunities in America's Top State for Business. With our resources and support, we’re here to help you thrive in Virginia’s robust job market.""
Youngkin has long touted Virginia’s improved business environment over the three years since Democratic predecessor Ralph Northam left office.

Another recent initiative entailed openly inviting all of Trump’s aides and new hires to settle in Virginia versus theDistrict of Columbiaor Maryland due to their higher-ranking schools and overall tax environment.
VirginiaWorks, which doubles as the Virginia Department of Workforce Development, said the fair featured virtual ""booths"" to meet with prospective employers, job search resources and live video interview opportunities.
Major participants included CACI, a California-founded information technology company now based in Reston, Virginia – as well as Newport News shipbuilders at the other end of the state.
Virginia’s efforts to recruit workers both affected by DOGE’s job cuts and from throughout the other parts of the Old Dominion will continue in earnest, a source familiar told Fox News Digital.
Youngkin said last week he has ""extraordinary empathy for the fact that there are many workers in Virginia from our federal workforce who are experiencing real concerns.""
CLIMATE PROTESTERS INTERRUPT YOUNGKIN'S 9/11 SPEECH
With at least 140,000 federal employees in his state, Youngkin said there are a quarter million openings across the Potomac in Virginia, and 100,000 in the DC Metro region of the commonwealth.
Defending DOGE last week in McLean, Youngkin said we ""have a federal government that is inefficient, and we have an administration that is taking on that challenge of rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse.""
Youngkin hails from neighboring Falls Church, where he previously worked as a business executive for the Carlyle Group and has influenced his work in Richmond with his experience in the private sector.

Youngkin’s virtual hiring event and position toward hiring ousted bureaucrats does have its vocal critics, including former top Jeb Bush aide Tim Miller.
Miller, a frequent Trump critic who is largely dissociated from today’s GOP, said on a podcast Wednesday that Youngkin’s move made him ""break out in hives,"" and scoffedat the governor’s""response to many of his constituents getting capriciously fired by 23-year-old vape-ers.""
Virginia Democratic Party chairwoman Susan Swecker added in a statement that Youngkin’s support for DOGE shows a ""gross misunderstanding of what it means to be jobless and without a paycheck, but he is shamelessly trying to play both sides by pretending to support federal workers while kissing the rings of Donald Trump and Elon Musk.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/protect-american-workers-how-trumps-team-can-fulfill-his-promise,Protect American workers: How Trump's team can fulfill his promise,"Teamsters President Sean O'Brien gives his take on Lori Michelle Chavez-DeRemer, President Donald Trump's labor secretary pick, on 'America Reports.'
PresidentDonald Trumppromised on Inauguration Day to ""protect American workers,"" and a month later, he’s off to a solid start. But there’s plenty left to do.
He started by ending the diversity, equity and inclusion programs that have been undermining workplace cooperation and fairness. Second, hesecured U.S. borders, so millions of illegal immigrants are no longer crossing into America, swelling the low-wage labor force.
Finally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that the share of union members in the U.S. workforce dipped below 10% (below 6% in the private sector), a new low.
Former President Trump speaks at a rally in Uniondale, New York on Sept. 18, 2024.(Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital)
These changes could make it easier for serious labor policy reforms that center not on businesses orlabor unions, but on individual American workers. The right steps would add flexibility to the workforce, spur job creation and encourage economic growth. The extra revenue generated would facilitate tax cuts.
TRUMP IS POPULAR AND SO ARE MANY OF HIS POLICIES. DEMOCRATS ARE TANKING
Regulatory reform is needed at three federal agencies that oversee labor laws and regulations: the U.S. Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
At the Labor Department, the administration should remove the economically inept ""environmental, social and governance"" investment criteria and instead protect workers’ retirement savings. Investment managers should be prohibited from advancing political agendas that reduce pension returns.
The administration should guarantee workers freedom of information and transparency, so union members know how their leaders are spending dues.
The administration could expand apprenticeship programs that unions, community colleges and employers may offer young people. America has shortages of plumbers, welders and electricians – high-paying professions for which traditional college credentials are not needed.
TRUMP-ZELENSKYY BRAWL COULD ACTUALLY BRING PEACE DEAL CLOSER
Biden-era ruleshave raised barriers to workers’ ability to work as independent contractors. The administration could protect workers who want to be independent contractors so they may monetize unused pockets of time and work for themselves regardless of education, income or industry.
The Labor Department should bring back the very successful Payroll Audit Independent Determination program, started by President Trump and ended by President Joe Biden, to get more workers the wages they are owed, bring employers into compliance and reduce litigation.
Reforms at the NLRB, a five-member commission charged with guaranteeing workers’ rights to unionize, are vital to restore its credibility – if it is even to survive – to provide certainty to workers and employers.
The NLRB should restore employers’ right to free speech by reversing the current ban on meetings with workers before union elections. It should overturn rulings limiting employers’ ability to communicate with workers during a union organizing drive.
15% CORPORATE TAX RATE AND 25% SMALL BUSINESS DEDUCTION SHOULD BE TRUMP TAX CUT CENTERPIECES
The NLRB should remove the joint-employer rule, whereemployees of franchised businessesare counted as employees of the parent company. More appropriate is the long-standing rule, where employers are those who control workers’ ""essential terms of employment."" Workers at independently owned McDonald’s outlets should be employees of their restaurants’ owners, not of far-off corporate McDonalds executives.
The NLRB should cease editing employer-handbook provisions or interfering with lawful severance agreements, as was done in the Biden administration.
The NLRB should protect workers from coercion in union elections by eliminating ""card check"" and requiring secret ballots for all union elections. Under a ""card check"" system, publicly signed cards count as votes, and union organizers can pressure workers into signing.
The EEOC, a five-member commission that enforces federal laws against employment discrimination, should protect workers from bias and harassment, including antisemitism, by accepting complaints and rapidly adjudicating them.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
The EEOC should allow firms to recruit on college campuses, as has been the case since the first universities in the 18th century.
The Biden EEOC contended that campus recruiting programs and others targeting recent college graduates are illegal. But courts have never declared them unlawful.
In the absence of discrimination allegations, the federal government should not be requiring EEO-1 reports – data from employers by race, sex and compensation. While discrimination charges must be investigated, these forms give rise to fishing expeditions to penalize well-intending employers and scare others into DEI activism.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
Finally, the EEOC should end the use ofdisparate impact claims against employers. Under these claims, employers are penalized if they do not hire a certain share of women and minorities, even though it’s illegal to hire based on sex or race.
These recommendations are first steps for the initial year of the Trump administration. Over the coming four years, the DOL, NLRB and EEOC have enormous potential to enhance prosperity for individual workers and lift the regulatory burden on employers and entrepreneurs to create jobs and upward mobility.

In a surprise announcement Sunday night, theU.S. Treasury Departmentput out a press release that could save tens of millions of small businesses from being treated like financial criminals and risking jail time and massive financial penalties.
The release, titled, ""Treasury Department Announces Suspension of Enforcement of Corporate Transparency Act Against U.S. Citizens and Domestic Reporting Companies,"" looks to be providing a big win for Main Street.
As I havetalked about here before, the Corporate Transparency Act (""CTA"") was vetoed by PresidentDonald Trumpin his first administration, but Congress overrode the veto. Then, the Biden administration’s Treasury went into full government overreach mode.

The beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting requirement of the CTA was forcing small business owners to have to register with the financial crimes division of Treasury (FinCEN) in a guilty-before-being-proven-innocent manner, plus creating egregious penalties for non-filing, late filing, incorrect filing or failure to update a filing.
TRUMP IS POPULAR AND SO ARE MANY OF HIS POLICIES. DEMOCRATS ARE TANKING
The March 2, 2025, Treasury releasesaid:
""The Treasury Department is announcing today that, with respect to the Corporate Transparency Act, not only will it not enforce any penalties or fines associated with the beneficial ownership information reporting rule under the existing regulatory deadlines, but it will further not enforce any penalties or fines against U.S. citizens or domestic reporting companies or their beneficial owners after the forthcoming rule changes take effect either.
""TheTreasury Departmentwill further be issuing a proposed rulemaking that will narrow the scope of the rule to foreign reporting companies only. Treasury takes this step in the interest of supporting hard-working American taxpayers and small businesses and ensuring that the rule is appropriately tailored to advance the public interest.
BIDEN GAVE AMERICANS THE BUSINESS. TRUMP IS GIVING US BUSINESSMEN
""‘This is a victory for common sense,’ said U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. ‘Today’s action is part of President Trump’s bold agenda to unleash American prosperity by reining in burdensome regulations, in particular for small businesses that are the backbone of the American economy.’""
The way that I and others interpret this, that means that U.S. small businesses and citizens will not have to file the CTA BOI with FinCEN and will not face any penalties. For tens of millions of small and private businesses, as well as housing association board members and others caught up in this mess, this is a big relief.

It is also a huge, long-fought victory, as the Biden administration had stymied every effort to overturn it.
It is also a great feeling to know that Main Street finally has advocates, including President Trump and Treasury Secretary Bessent, in the administration.
Bessent said during his confirmation hearing, ""I think it's Main Street's time. Wall Street can continue to do well, maybe not as well, and it's time to have a Main Street small business-led recovery…"" How refreshing it is to have government officials walk the talk.

To ensure permanency (that is, so it doesn’t get put back in place in a future administration), small businesses need for Congress to codify that the CTA BOI rule should only apply to foreign reporting companies, so hopefully everyone will call their representatives and ask them to follow Treasury’s leadership.
But for now, Main Street can count on one barrier broken down and small businesses can focus on thriving.

""Look, it comes down to great content, great journalism and a great brand ultimately. If you look at the Fox News viewer, they're incredibly loyal. They're passionate about the service. They really see it as not just as a news service but as a network for them. It's important to note that we don't see Fox News anymore as just a news service.

And that's how we're able to drive, frankly, the affiliate revenue growth that we've achieved.""
Swinburne then said, ""I don't think I'm breaking any news here to say after the election, a lot of people feel like the whole country is sort of stepping to the right a bit politically. Is that something that you guys are reacting to at the network in terms of the program or how you manage the business?""

We cover stories that we believe - our viewers - are newsworthy and that our viewers are interested in. That hasn't changed. I think what has changed is perhaps it's the reverse of what you're applying in your question, is that the election and the election results have sort of validated Fox News' position, and we've seen that most strikingly in our advertising revenues,"" Murdoch said.
""We've had over 100 new clients since the election -- obviously, our ratings are doing tremendously well. Our share is doing tremendously well, over 65% share of the cable news universe.

Now that House Republicans have agreed on a budget resolution to finance their legislative priorities, debate begins on the specific tax cuts to include in the final ""big, beautiful bill.""
At the top of this list is fulfilling PresidentDonald Trump's oft-repeated call to reduce the corporate tax to 15%. This tax rate cut would make the U.S. significantly more competitive and jumpstart oureconomy still feeling the effects of four years of anti-growth policies.
According to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a 15% corporate tax rate would significantly boost GDP, wages and jobs.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which took effect in 2018, reduced the corporate tax from 35% – one of the world's highest – to 21%, middle of the pack. In response, U.S. corporations increased their domestic investment by an average of 20%, according to an NBER study that analyzed 12,000 corporate tax returns.
TRUMP IS POPULAR AND SO ARE MANY OF HIS POLICIES. DEMOCRATS ARE TANKING
The lower tax rate is a major reason whyU.S. living standardshave far outpaced other developed countries over the last several years.
A 15% tax rate would create a new wave of success. Shareholders, including the 61% of Americans who own stocks, and ordinary workers would be the biggest beneficiaries.
A 15% corporate tax rate cut would also help small businesses, 1.5 million of which are structured as corporations. Small companies that service corporations and their workers would also benefit from new opportunities and higher revenues.
I HELPED TRUMP GET HIS FIRST TAX CUT BILL THROUGH CONGRESS. FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION THIS TIME
But what about the vast majority of small businesses structured as pass-throughs and paying tax at individual rates?The Republican tax billshouldalso give these entities relief similar to that proposed for incorporated businesses.
Small unincorporated businesses were among the biggest beneficiaries of the TCJA. They received a 20% tax deduction, accelerated expensing, and lower tax rates, bringing new life to the nation's entrepreneurship climate.
Nearly 20 million small businesses benefit from the TCJA deduction every year. Unfortunately, the TCJA's small business provisions expire at the end of the year.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Lawmakers can keep the tax code fair by increasing the 20% small business tax deduction to 25% at the same time they reduce thecorporate rate to 15%. This larger deduction means a small business earning $200,000 per year would face an effective tax rate that's roughly the same as corporations (not including other deductions).
Lawmakers should also look to extend this small business deduction to even more pass-through entities. Currently, it phases out at about $200,000 of earnings for non-manufacturer single filers. Significantly increasing this income threshold would allow many more middle-class small businesses to enjoy tax relief, avoid punishments for growth, and compete on a level playing field with corporations.
Thesecorporate and small business tax cutswould spur an economic boom that would pay for much, if not most tax, of their cost in a replay of the original TCJA. Since 2017, inflation-adjusted tax revenue (excluding tariffs) has significantly increased. Democrats and their media allies claiming fiscal calamity from Republican tax cuts were wrong then, and they're wrong now.

It is spending, not tax cuts, that is driving the deficit. Since 2017, federal spending has ballooned from $4 trillion annually to nearly $7 trillion due to reckless and inflationary spending. Fortunately, theGOP budget compromiseincludes a targeted $2 trillion in spending cuts to get the deficit under control.
As lawmakers begin debating which tax cuts to include in their historic reconciliation bill that will determine the country's economic outlook over the next decade, everything should be on the table. But a 15% corporate tax rate and a broad, 25% small business deduction should be the centerpieces.

Sen. Jim Banks, R-Ind., praised the likely decision by Honda to manufacture its popular Honda Civic model in Indiana instead of Mexico.
The move by the major automaker was triggered by President Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on Mexico, which are set to go into effect on Tuesday after a month-long pause after a temporary agreement with the country,Reuters reported.
The outlet reported that production is likely to start in 2028 for over 200,000 vehicles, but the announcement has yet to be made public by the company.
""President Trump has taken the ‘kick me’ sign off the backs of our workers and manufacturers. This report is great news for Hoosiers and all Americans—and it’s only just the beginning,"" Banks said in an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital.

""The America First agenda is going to be racking up countless wins over the next four years,"" the senator added.
The report is presumably good news for the Greensburg, Indiana, plant of the Japanese company, which has over 3,000 employees and opened in 2008, according to its website. Greenburg itself has a population of just over 12,000 people, according to the United States Census Bureau data from 2023. WISH-TV reported that Honda only has one plant in Indiana right now.
""It’s called the ‘TRUMP EFFECT,’"" the White House’s rapid response account tweeted Monday.
Trump’s tariff policies on Mexico, Canada and China have made waves in recent weeks as proponents argue it’s a critical step in boosting American manufacturing and stopping illicit fentanyl trafficking, whereas opponents worry it will unnecessarily raise the price of goods. The president also announced that reciprocal tariffs all over the globe will take place on April 2.

""To the Great Farmers of the United States: Get ready to start making a lot of agricultural product to be sold INSIDE of the United States. Tariffs will go on external product on April 2nd. Have fun!"" Trump said on Truth Social on Monday.
As for Banks, he recently praised the reciprocal tariffs, saying they will likely serve as a benefit to the United States.
""The globalist approach to trade threw our workers under a bus driven by their foreign competitors,"" Banks tweeted on Feb. 13. ""President Trump’s America First trade plan corrects this injustice that our industries and workers have faced for decades. The reciprocal tariffs announced today will bring back fairness and prosperity and stop Americans from being taken advantage of.""

Officers at the Auburn Correctional Facility continue to hold the line on the third day of their strike to protest unsafe working conditions in Auburn, New York, on Thursday, Feb. 20, 2025.(AP)
On Thursday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced a binding agreement between the state andofficers' unionto end the strike. Under the deal, officers were required to return to work by Saturday to avoid being disciplined for picketing, as the labor action violates a state law prohibiting strikes by most public employees.
This comes as state police launched an investigation into the death of an inmate at one of the state's prisons over the weekend.
Messiah Nantwi, 22, who was housed at Mid-State Correctional Facility, died Saturday at a hospital in the city of Utica.
Nantwi entered the state prison system in May and was serving a five-year sentence for second-degree criminal possession of a weapon in connection with a 2021 shooting involving police officers. Nantwi, who had been represented by the public defender's office, was also awaiting trial in the shooting deaths of two men in 2023.
Officials have declined to provide additional details on what led to his death, but other inmates told The New York Times that Nantwi was brutally beaten by correctional officers.
""True, he was incarcerated, but he was still entitled, like all of us, to basic human dignity and safety,"" Stan German, executive director of the New York County Defender Services, said in a statement. ""Instead, he suffered a violent senseless death at the hands of state corrections officers operating within a toxic culture that our society mainly ignores.""
The corrections department said 11 staffers have been placed on administrative leave, pending the results of theongoing probeinto Nantwi's death.
Mid-State is across the street from the Marcy Correctional Facility, where six guards have been charged with murder in the December beating death of Robert Brooks.

NY CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS REPEATEDLY STRUCK HANDCUFFED INMATE, PICKED HIM UP BY HIS NECK BEFORE HE DIED: VIDEO
Another inmate, 61-year-old Jonathon Grant, was pronounced dead last month after he was found unresponsive in his cell at the Auburn Correctional Facility amid the ongoing labor strike, although it is unclear if prison staffing played a role in his death.
The manner in which Grant died will be determined by a medical examiner. The public defender’s office that provided legal counsel to him expressed concern that the strike may have impacted medical care for inmates.
Officers began walking out on Feb. 17 to protest working conditions at the state's prisons.
Jose Saldana, the director of the Release Aging People in Prison Campaign, said guards were striking as a ""distraction"" from the attention on inmate abuse.
""To put it more bluntly, guards are holding hostage tens of thousands of incarcerated people, whose basic survival needs are often going unmet, in order to demand even more power to harm those in their custody,"" Saldana said.
The deal between the state and officers' union to end the officers' strike included ways to address staffing shortages and minimize mandatory 24-hour overtime shifts. The agreement also offers a temporary increase in overtime pay and a potential change in pay scale.

A 90-day suspension of a law limiting the use of solitary confinement was also included in the agreement. During the pause, the state must evaluate if reinstating the law would ""create an unreasonable risk"" to staff and inmate safety.
Hochul deployed the National Guard to some prisons to fill in for striking workers.
Corrections Commissioner Daniel Martuscello said Monday that the number of facilities with striking workers dipped from 38 to 32, although visits remained suspended at all state prisons.
""No matter when this ends or how this ends, our long-term plan must be and is to recruit more corrections officers because our facilities run safer when we’re fully staffed,"" Bray said. ""That work can’t really begin in earnest until folks return to work and we end the strike.""

The arrest of an illegal migrant who was dropping students at schoolin Chicagoearlier this week sparked local fury and a rally, but Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) have since revealed the suspect is a violent gang member with a long rap sheet.
Francisco Andrade-Berrera, 37, a Mexican citizen, was picked by ICE on Wednesday near a Southside Chicago school, leading to activists and local leaders holding a rally condemning the move. Video obtained by Fox News shows two agents handcuffing Andrade-Berrera near the school.
In response to the arrest, two nearby schools activated ""Community Wellness Protocols"" and notified parents that additional social work support would be available to help students cope with the ""stressful and upsetting"" nature of the event.

TRUMP OFFICIALS GIVE ICE GOAL ON NUMBER OF ARRESTS PER DAY: REPORT
But the outbursts erupted before the full facts of the case came through, with ICE telling Fox News that Andrade-Berrera is a member of a violent street gang with criminal convictions for drug trafficking, gang loitering and damage to property.
He hasbeen removedfrom the U.S. twice, in 2005 and 2013. He has at least four children, according to prior reports.
The two students who were in the vehicle were taken to their schools after the arrest but agents did not attempt to enter either Victoria Soto High School or Jovita Idar Elementary, ICE and school officials confirmed. It is unclear if the students are his children.
Andrade-Berrera pleaded guilty in 2023 to purchasing roughly five ounces of cocaine that federal prosecutors in Chicago said he planned to sell, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
He was sentenced to three years of supervised release and given credit for two weeks spent in custody.
Andrade-Berrera described himself as a husband and the ""father of 4 beautiful kids,"" in a letter to a judge explaining that he worked as a chef and dreamed of opening his own restaurant, per the outlet.
""I have worked hard to support my family all these years and made sure they have a good life,"" he wrote. ""If I could go back in time I would without hesitation.""
His wife told the judge he’s a dedicated father, noting that she and the children ""need him with us"" and that her biggest fear is him ""going away and leaving us.'
This incident follows a similar situation just a month ago, when Chicago Public Schools wrongly reported that ICE agents had tried to enter a different school in the area.

Fired pipeline worker Lynn ""Bugsy"" Allen shared that he is optimistic President Donald Trump will bring back theKeystone XL Pipeline projectand help families ""prosper.""
On his first day in office,former President Joe Bidenissued an executive order revoking Trump’s permit to expedite the pipeline’s approval, which would have brought oil down from Alberta, Canada, through the middle of the United States.
""I believe 100% solely that Donald J. Trump is going to get this line back going,"" Allen said Wednesday on ""America Reports.""
""So that's the difference between a man that wants to drive the oil and gas and make our United States prosperous plus have our families to prosper, because it's coming,"" he continued. ""We're going to be begging for a day off.""
TRUMP CALLS FOR COMPANY BUILDING KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE TO RETURN TO AMERICA AND ‘GET IT BUILT’
Trump said the company building the proposed pipeline ""should come back to America, and get it built – NOW!"" in a Truth Social post on Feb. 24. He added that his administration is ""very different"" from Biden’s and has ""easy approvals.""
Allen, who was employed on the Keystone XL project and lost his job after Biden’s executive order, contrasted his job security under each administration. He discussed how it felt to be laid off after Biden halted the pipeline's construction.
""I was on [the project] for approximately, about four to six months,"" he continued. ""And as soon as Biden took office, we was laid off that day. They told us that the job is done, we’re through, and we was off the job.""

He credited God for providing for his family while he was no longer working on the XL pipeline and praised Trump’s ""common horse sense.""
""I put a son through college, and I can tell you, the future was very dim,"" Allen said. ""In other words, it's just all you could do to try to prosper your family. I had to do other projects that, you know, that I've done a lot [in] my younger days. But, you know what, I got by, God provided for us. But now we have such a wonderful blessing of a good president with common horse sense that knows how to push America first, the American people first.""

As for the future of the oil industry, Allen emphasized that its ""prosperity"" will trickle down to local communities.
""I want to tell you, whenever there's the pipeline comes through your town, get ready, because everybody's going to prosper. Not only just the workers, it's the towns that prosper. It is the best driver for America because everybody's got to have a place to stay. Everybody's got to buy food, fuel — and the thing is, whenever Biden ended all of it, it's struggled.""

Kathy Hochul's meeting to discuss the possibility of removing Mayor Eric Adams from office after four local officials resigned due to his cooperation with President Donald Trump.
New York officialshave reached an agreement to end a two-week unsanctioned strike by correctional officers over Democrat-backed prison reforms that they say have made conditions ""unsafe,"" but a GOP lawmaker argued the deal fails to address ""the basics of what people are angry about.""
""The things that they're most upset about are things that are the subject of legislation,""Republican stateSen. Daniel Stec told Fox News Digital in an interview Friday.
Themediated dealwas reached late Thursday between the New York State Correctional Officers, the government-affiliated corrections officers union, Police Benevolent Association (NYSCOPBA) and the state's Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS).
However, since some 15,000 correction workers have been on a ""wildcat strike,"" they were not present during negotiations, and a spokesperson for the striking workers told CBS the deal does not go far enough.

""The issues have always been there,"" Stec said. ""Officer safety mandated overtime, some of these guys are working so much overtime that they're never home, and it's thrust upon them. On top of that, during the nature of their job, they're working, sometimes they are forced to work 24 or more hours consecutively.""
At issue is a piece of prison reform legislation, the Humane Alternatives to Long-Term Solitary Confinement Act (HALT), that strikers want repealed. The law restricts solitary confinement and instead focuses on other rehabilitation methods, but since it went into effect in 2022, GOP lawmakers, citingdepartment stats, say it has led to a 169% increase in inmate-on-inmate assaults, a 76% increase in inmate-on-staff assaults and a 32% jump in contraband cases.
""She doesn't care, she cares about the inmates and their rights. [The deal] is a slap in every officer's face.""
Stec said ""it's not safe for the officers, it's not safe inside for anybody"" and said ""this has been pointed out to the administration time and time again since before they put HALT into effect.""

One mom of a corrections officer told Fox News Digital on Friday, ""These are things that our governor doesn't care about.""
""She doesn't care, she cares about the inmates and their rights,"" she said. ""[The deal] is a slap in every officer's face.""
Upon the released agreement,Gov. Kathy Hochulsaid in part, ""My top priority is the safety of all New Yorkers, and for the past 11 days, I have deployed every possible State resource to protect the well-being of correction officers, the incarcerated population and local communities across New York.""
""Working with a mediator, we have reached a consent award to address many of the concerns raised by correction officers, put DOCCS back on the path to safe operations, respect the rights of incarcerated individuals and prevent future unsanctioned work stoppages,"" she said.

In a letter alongside the agreement, Mediator Martin F. Scheinman proposed a binding ""Consent Award"" that would formalize agreements reached in mediation and be enforceable by court order. He noted the enforcement of such an agreement is complicated by a temporary restraining order, which rendersjudicial enforcementdifficult while the strike continues. He said the Consent Award will only be signed once the court order is complied with.
""I will not issue a CONSENT AWARD I believe will be unenforceable judicially,"" Scheinman wrote.
The mediation agreement temporarily suspends key provisions of the HALT Act for 90 days, with a review by the DOCCS commissioner after 30 days to determine if the suspension should continue. Following the suspension, a ""circuit breaker"" staffing metric will be implemented to prevent mandatory 24-hour overtime shifts, requiring facility adjustments if staffing falls below 70%.
The agreement also says protesting officers will be shielded from disciplinary action if they return to work by March 1, but those involved in illegal activities will face penalties. Other provisions include pay increases, referral bonuses, mental health support and security screening to curtail drugs in the prison mail system.
Additionally,the National Guard– which Hochul requested after thousands of officers did not show up to work – will remain onsite.
Stec said corrections officers see the deal as something the state is seeking to ""shovel money at.""
""In reading the agreement, there's a lot of discussion in there about overtime and money, and people are always going to talk about money, but the impetus to this has always been about their safety,"" he said.
In a statement to Fox News Digital, a NYSCOPBA spokesperson said, ""The Consent Agreement provides what concessions DOCCS has made in relation to members demands. HALT, unfortunately cannot be repealed without legislation from the senate and assembly.""
""NYSCOPBA has encouraged all members to return to work and it will continue to work towards addressing all of their concerns,"" the spokesperson said.

Beginning on Feb. 17, two officers from the New York Department of Corrections began striking over ""unsafe"" conditions in their facilities, and support quickly cascaded across 38 of the state's 42 prisons, leading to thousands of workers participating in the strike without union approval, which is prohibited underNew York law.
Days before the strike, officials at the Collins Correctional Facility in Erie County implemented a lockdown following an inmate uprising.

Hochul threatened legal action earlier this week against striking correctional officers, announcing during a press conference that proceedings have commenced against nearly 400 officers, with New York State Police serving restraining orders to 380 individuals. Hochul said officers remaining on strike are considered absent without leave (AWOL), resulting in the loss of state health benefits and legal representation previouslyprovided by their union.
""They know they are in violation of the New York State Taylor law,"" Hochul said during the press conferece. ""They are also in violation of a temporary restraining order to return to work. We offered an amnesty period where they could go back to work, no questions asked.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-stopped-bidens-plan-force-dei-local-communities,Trump stopped Biden’s plan to force DEI on local communities,"Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner on cutting $4 million in DEI contracts and uncovering $1.9 billion in misplaced funds under the Biden administration.
The pullback from diversity, equity and inclusion programs — in government agencies and business — has focused on their impact at the individual level — on hiring, or college admission. But an under-the-radar initiative of the Biden administration’sDepartment of Housing and Urban Developmentplanned DEI for communities across the country. It would do so through required ""equity plans"" — emphasizing changes in planning and zoning — for virtually every community receiving HUD funds.
Now, in the name of ""cutting costly red tape imposed on localities and returning decision-making power to state and local governments,"" new HUD Secretary Scott Turner has rolled that mandate back. HUD has replaced all the complications of the""Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing""rule with a simple requirement: a locality’s ""own certification"" that is complying with fair housing law. It’s as important a change as any Washington is making, affecting local governments across the country.
The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) program — first adopted by the Obama administration, thenhalted by Trump 45before being brought back by Biden — literally demanded that any community receiving HUD funding submit an ""equity plan,"" based on responses to 92 questions, to continue to qualify for financial aid.
HUD TERMINATES OBAMA-ERA HOUSING RULE THAT TRUMP WARNED WOULD 'DESTROY' HOME VALUES
Its name notwithstanding, AFFH went far beyond the commonsense idea of protecting minority renters and home buyers from racial discrimination. The details of its required ""equity plan"" portended what amounted to a federal takeover of local zoning for purposes that went far beyond overt housing discrimination.
The Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing program was pushed by both former Democrat Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. FILE: Obama and Biden in October 2020.(Credit: Joe Biden/Instagram)
Per the Biden HUD description of the program: ""The AFFH mandate requires the agency and its program participants to proactively take meaningful actions to overcome patterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice, eliminate disparities in opportunities, and foster inclusive communities free from discrimination.""
Translated, that meant that in order to qualify for federal community assistance, communities would have to pledge not only to open their doors to ""affordable"" (i.e., subsidized) housing but to take steps to ensure that residents of such housing would have access to good schools, recreation, even supermarkets — and other ""community assets.""
In other words, both permitting affordable housing and pressuring communities to locate it in ""high opportunity"" (read, more affluent) neighborhoods. The impulse here is that of ""deconcentrating poverty,"" with the assumption that doing so will uplift the poor, notwithstanding the obvious practical limitations of relocating households en masse.
The reach of the rule was as broad as its goals. HUD distributes community development block grant funds — meant to help lower-income communities, for purposes ranging from infrastructure to health and safety — to more than 1,200 ""entitlement communities."" Those included all major metropolitan cities, cities with populations of 50,000 or greater, and urban counties with populations of 200,000 or greater (excluding entitlement city populations.
In order for their equity plans to be approved by HUD’s funding gatekeepers, local governments had to be mindful of the Biden administration HUD’s broader ""equity action plan,"" which called upon them to address such wide-ranging goals as ""environmental justice,"" ""climate resilience,"" as well as ""to better serve lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex, and asexual (LGBTQIA+) youth experiencing homelessness and housing instability.""

In demonstrating how they would take steps to ""affirmatively"" prevent housing discrimination, communities were called upon, in plans that could run to hundreds of pages, not simply to demonstrate their capacity to ensure individuals did not face housing discrimination, but to identify ""barriers to fair housing"" that could include everything from school district lines to local zoning.
This becomes clear from HUD ""denial letters,"" to local goverments informing them they’d failed to pass AFFH muster. One Georgia county reported, for instance, that it was seeking more affordable housing to help low-income households get better jobs. That wasn’t good enough for HUD, which wrote that the county had been ""unclear as to how it intends to use this goal to address issues of segregation and racial/ethnic concentrations of poverty."" Nor had the county dealt with ""the location of proficient schools.""

The idea of adding affordable housing — if defined as denser, privately built housing — to a range of communities is not inherently misguided. Indeed, communities where two-acre zoning is the norm risk zoning out their own children and the workforce they need for local businesses and governments.
Modest changes in zoning — what Edward Pinto and Tobias Peters call ""light-touch density"" — can go a long way toward such ends. But that’s different than subsidized, low-income housing — inexpensive to rent but costly to construct (one tax-credit-funded ""affordable unit"" in California costs an estimated $708,000 to build).

More broadly, AFFH has been predicated on misguided premises. So-called ""high opportunity neighborhoods"" are not redoubts of privilege and discrimination but, rather, the products of the commitment and civic efforts of residents. The life choices — marriage, work, savings — that lead families to well-functioning communities are ends in themselves.
Simply relocating poor households to more affluent communities shortcuts that process — and offers no guarantee that those households will fare better in the long run. A HUD directive to alter the demographics and zoning of communities across the country won’t do so either.

There is a big homeownership gap between low- and high-income households.(iStock)
As I think aboutBlack History Month,I cannot help but think about how I have benefited from my family’s sacrifices – and I know I am not the only one.
Their strength and tenacity paved the way for me to persevere in my life.
As thelongest-serving Black senatorin U.S. history and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I have seen firsthand that poverty does not discriminate. Sadly, people from all different races and walks of life struggle to afford basic necessities like food and shelter. It’s our responsibility to keep lifting these folks up – no matter their background, their family history or where they live.
I have developed a plan – built around three legislative proposals of mine – to empower underserved communities like the one I grew up in.By boosting affordable housing,growing small businesses and bolstering my Opportunity Zones initiative, a tool for encouraging investment in distressed areas of the United States, we can positively impact the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans.
Housing has long been a cornerstone of wealth-building in America. Yet today, too many families, especially in low-income and working-class communities struggle to access it.
While the national average for homeownership is 65.7%, we need to close the homeownership gap between low- and high-income households. In 2023, just 47% of households in the lowest-income group were homeowners, compared to 81% in the highest-income group.
This gap directly results from outdated policies and a housing market that has become increasingly unaffordable to the very people who need it most.
My legislation, the ""ROAD to Housing Act,"" will tear down outdated barriers and unlock billions to make homeownership affordable again.
As the longest-serving Black senator in U.S. history and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, I have seen firsthand that poverty does not discriminate.
We must expand access to small-dollar mortgages, redefine manufactured housing and modernize public housing. When families own their homes instead of renting them, they build generational wealth and close the wealth gap. We must ensure this opportunity is available to everyone.
Another tool for economic mobility is entrepreneurship.
I know this firsthand.
When I was starting my small business, I went to a bank and looked for an opportunity to get a loan. My best asset then was a 1990, 10-year-old car with 253,000 miles. One would not consider that an asset, perhaps a liability, but it was my only means of transportation.
In those days, people could get a character loan, and because of that loan, my financial life changed, and my American Dream became a reality.
Had I not gotten that loan, I might not be where I am today.
Unfortunately, others have not had the same blessing.
Expanding capital access and reducing regulatory burdens on community banks, which are critical to supporting local and small businesses, will empower first-time and non-traditional entrepreneurs.

My legislation, the ""Empowering Main Street in America Act,"" aims to enhance capital access for a wider spectrum of entrepreneurs, particularly those in underserved communities, including rural/non-metropolitan areas.
My bill has strong support from my fellow Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee because it seeks to streamline regulations for small and newly public businesses that are looking to grow while also fostering new investment avenues for Americans eager to do business locally.

I believe that when businesses flourish, entire communities prosper. Access to capital should not be reserved for the privileged few.
Financial inclusion means ensuring that people who pay their bills responsibly have this reflected on their credit scores, making it easier for them to obtain a loan or take out a mortgage. My legislative efforts have pushed for common-sense reforms because the process of determining a person’s creditworthiness is outdated and not holistic.
As I think about Black History Month, I cannot help but think about how I have benefited from my family’s sacrifices – and I know I am not the only one.
When we find the right opportunities, better things will come.
Through my Opportunity Zones initiative, we have unlocked nearly $85 billion in investments for distressed communities. This program successfully encourages long-term, sustainable growth in disadvantaged communities without gentrifying them or displacing the people it aims to help. By renewing the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" and the Opportunity Zones initiative, we will ensure that we continue to drive investments into areas that need them most.

In one of the cases, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper shot down a request from several labor unions, including the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), to issue a pause on the mass firings of federal workers.
NTEU and four other labor unions representing the federal employees filed a complaint on Feb. 12, challenging the firing of probationary employees and the deferred resignation program.

Under the resignation program, federal employees were presented with a fork in the road, meaning they could either return to office or they could resign from their positions and continue to get paid through September.
The deadline to decide was originally Feb. 6, though the date was ultimately deferred to Feb. 12, then subsequently closed that day.

The unions moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to prevent the firing of probationary employees across all federal agencies and furtherance of the resignation program on Feb. 14, and the next day it was sent to Cooper’s court.

The minimum wage for workers was $16 before the $20 minimum wage for fast-food workers became law in April 2024. Gov. Gavin Newsom said in September 2023 the increase would help workers earn more as the cost-of-living rises.
""Fast food workers in CA will now be paid the highest minimum wage of any state in the country. I just signed a bill that will ensure these workers receive the fair pay they deserve,"" he tweeted at the time.

However, the report also cautioned that it may also result in people getting paid less overall and ""accelerate automation.""
""If large enough, the combination of job eliminations and reductions could leave workers earning less income as a result of (the) $20 minimum wage,"" the report stated.
""For example, even if no jobs are eliminated (a dubious assumption given the BLS data discussed above), a 20% reduction in hours worked with no overtime increases would erase the financial gains from the 25% hourly wage increase, leaving workers with the same or even less total income,"" it continued.
The California Fast Food Council may consider increasing the minimum wage to $20.70, according toRestaurant Business Magazine.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/hud-terminates-obama-era-housing-trump-destroy-home-values,HUD terminates Obama-era housing rule that Trump warned would 'destroy' home values,"Josh Flagg says the aftermath of the Los Angeles fires is ‘very scary’ for the families affected.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) eliminated federal regulations created during the Obama administration, which Secretary Scott Turner accused of putting ""extreme and restrictive demands"" on local housing developers.
President Donald Trumprescinded the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) rule, created under former President Barack Obama, during his first administration. Trump said at the time in a speech about cutting red tape in the federal government that the rule serves to ""eliminate single-family zoning to destroy the value of houses"" at the benefit of ""far-left Washington bureaucrats.""
Then-President Joe Biden later worked to reinstate the rule but ultimately pulled back due to fear it could make him politically vulnerable as he sought reelection, according to Politico. On Wednesday, HUD initiated its own rulemaking to squash the Obama-era AFFH rule, which mandated that localities commission extensive analyses to certify that new housing developments do not exacerbate disparities among federally protected groups. This includes access topublic transportation,schools, hospitals and parks.

During a Wednesday conference call about the AFFH rule's termination, a HUD official said that discrimination that is prohibited under the Fair Housing Act of 1968 will still remain illegal. But under the new change, localities will now be able to self-certify that their new developments comply with anti-discrimination laws implemented under the 1968 Fair Housing Act.
""Over the past four years, and really dating back to theObama administration,far-left Democrats have tried to socially re-engineer communities from the top down,"" Turner said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/china-threatens-our-farmers-food-supply-states-need-step-up,China threatens our farmers and food supply. States need to step up,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP)is on a mission to secure influence over every aspect of American life. Most of us are familiar with China’s push to steal our intellectual property, undercut our job market and brainwash our children on social media. But the area where China has arguably been the most aggressive has been its initiative to gain a foothold over American agriculture.
This not-so-silent takeover is partially fueled by large-scale land acquisition. Currently, the CCP owns an estimated 349,442 acres of agricultural land – which is 82% more than the year prior.
The growing Chinesetakeover of American farmlandis a crisis.
TAIWAN DISPATCHES NAVY, AIR FORCE AFTER CHINA LAUNCHES LIVE-FIRE DRILLS WITH NO WARNING
Thankfully, conservative leaders in recent years have identified this dangerous trend and are starting to push back, particularly in GOP-led states. While conservative legislators and governors across the country are taking action to stop adversarial nations from buying U.S. farmland, we must recognize that there’s a much broader issue at play here – China’s end goal is not confined to land ownership.

The CCP is deploying new tactics thatextend its economicgrip into American agricultural manufacturing, where Chinese companies are aiming to dominate the production of essential crop science products.
The first step to preventing America’s food supply from being further taken over by the CCP is to protect and support our American agricultural manufacturers who choose to keep their operations on U.S. soil, create American jobs and contribute to local economies. Protecting U.S. farmers and the products they need to feed America is the next step in addressing the long-term threat China poses to our food supply.
We cannot cede our food production process to the CCP – or it will give one of our top adversaries immense leverage over one of the most essential sectors of our economy. After witnessing how the CCP handled the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in one of its government labs, we know that the CCP cannot be trusted to be transparent about what is being added to our food.
There has been much excitement from conservatives about the Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) agenda, which President Donald Trump has implemented after making it a central pillar of his 2024 campaign platform. If we don’t take steps to curb China’s efforts to undermine our food supply, then we risk reversing that good work.
Protecting American manufacturers is also key to Trump’s America First agenda. And we need the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress to help him in this fight. But Trump needs leaders in the states to continue carrying out his America First agenda, too. State leaders must join the fight to stop the CCP threat and protect American agriculture.
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Governors need to establish protections for American agricultural manufacturers to eliminate the CCP’s influence on our food supply and ensure we prevent good-paying American jobs from being outsourced.
New legislation in Georgia, Iowa, and Missouri is designed to do just that. The legislation, put forth to establish protections for U.S. agriculture manufacturers, is an America First policy that other states should be replicating. If this legislation protecting our farmers is not passed, we are setting up the CCP’s takeover of our food supply and are creating a serious national security threat for ourselves.
We cannot cede our food production process to the CCP – or it will give one of our top adversaries immense leverage over one of the most essential sectors of our economy.
Winning this fight, however, will not be easy. Trial lawyers in all three states are engaged in an aggressive lobbying campaign against these respective anti-CCP bills. These lawyers have managed to buy off so-called conservative state legislators in each of these states through sizable campaign contributions.

State legislators who are actively working against these bills on behalf of the trial lawyers are turning their backs on the very people they swore to protect and represent. What’s more, those who refuse to support these protections for American workers and for our food are choosing to put America last and are counteracting Trump’s tough-on-China and pro-American agenda.
We need more than just rhetoric; we need decisive and proactive steps taken by leaders in the states to stop the CCP’s encroaching and dangerous influence. Georgia, Iowa and Missouri are leading the charge with legislation to protect American farmers and the U.S. food supply – they deserve our complete support.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., discusses President Donald Trump’s first cabinet meeting and how House Republicans are advancing his tax cut plan
House and Senate Republicans are heading for a messy showdown over how long to extend PresidentDonald Trump’stax cuts.
The two chambers are at odds over how to advance Trump’s agenda via the budget reconciliation process, a maneuver that will allow Republicans to advance their agenda without Democratic support.
As part of that, GOP lawmakers are aiming to extend the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) before its provisions expire at the end of 2025, as well as implement more recent Trump tax priorities.
House Republicansadopted a resolutionon Tuesday evening that would provide roughly $4.5 trillion for Trump’s tax priorities over the next 10 years, with a goal of working to eventually make them permanent. The Senate adopted a narrower competing resolution earlier this month that would leave taxes for a second bill to come later.
KEY CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS DRAWS RED LINE ON HOUSE BUDGET PLAN

But Senate GOP leaders are pushing to make the tax cuts permanent while Republicans are working through the reconciliation process.
Senate Republicans are signaling they would rewrite the House’s product significantly, a push that’s irked Republicans in that chamber.
""The Senate resolution punted on accomplishing the majority of President Trump’s agenda, and now they are further delaying and endangering it by announcing they will rewrite what narrowly passed the House,"" a senior House GOP aide told Fox News Digital.
Nevertheless, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., congratulated House Republicans on passing their resolution but added, ""A key part of that agenda is making the pro-growth Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, which is why we’ll work closely with our House colleagues to ensure the final package includes all of the president’s key tax priorities, including permanency, which will create long-term certainty for working families in America.""
Trump himself even weighed in on the matter. He wrote on his Truth Social app on Wednesday morning, ""I hope the House and Senate are able to agree on making the Tax Cuts PERMANENT!""
But Republicans are also dealing with razor-thin margins in both chambers of Congress. In the House, they can currently only lose one Republican vote with full attendance, while Senate Republicans can afford three defectors.
Getting the House resolution across the line proved dramatic on Monday night, with Republican leaders working up until the final moments to convince conservative fiscal hawks who were wary of how much the legislation would add to the federal deficit.

It could prove more difficult if they did the exercise again, but with even more funding allocated toward Trump’s tax priorities.
""The Senate can push all they want to. This is being driven by the House,"" Ways & Means Committee member Rep. Greg Murphy, R-N.C., told Fox News Digital.
""I don’t see how it can be permanent,"" another House Republican on Ways & Means told Fox News Digital.
Murphy denied that Trump’s earlier Truth Social post made the situation more difficult for their side, however, explaining the ultimate ""goal is"" to make those provisions permanent.
The Senateadvanced its own narrower versionof the plan that would split Trump’s priorities into two parts earlier this month. The resolution that passed would repeal some progressive Biden administration policies and provide new funding for defense and border security, while leaving taxes for a second bill.
A significant number of House Republicans balked at that plan, worried that tax cuts could expire for millions of Americans if two reconciliation bills prove too heavy a lift.
But Senate Republicans want to spend more time cobbling together a tax plan they believe is closer to what Trump wants, and that this reconciliation opportunity is the best lane to do it.

""We have to give greater certainty for working families. With President Trump in the White House, we have a unique opportunity to make the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent. The Senate will have to rewrite House Republicans’ budget resolution in order to do so.""
The senior House GOP aide who spoke with Fox News Digital said, however, ""Republicans in both chambers want to deliver on President Trump’s promise and the American people’s mandate for a lengthy extension of the Trump tax cuts.""
""Congress can do this quickly by passing the only resolution that has already passed through one chamber of Congress – the House resolution – that has the capacity to implement the full Trump agenda,"" they said.

President Donald Trump’splan to offer a ""gold card"" visa to wealthy immigrants is similar to policies in use in more than three dozen countries, although the U.S. proposal would come with the highest price tag, an expert tells Fox News Digital.
""What you’re doing is you’re bringing in wealthier individuals, clearly job creators, consumers,"" Anthony Esposito, founder and CEO of Island Capital Investments, told Fox News Digital.
Esposito’s comments come after Trump said Tuesday that he planned to offer a ""gold card"" visa that gives recipients apath to U.S. citizenshipfor $5 million, telling reporters such a program would be ""extremely successful.""
""They’ll be wealthy and they’ll be successful, and they’ll be spending a lot of money and paying a lot of taxes and employing a lot of people, and we think it’s going to be extremely successful,"" Trump said Tuesday from the Oval Office, according to a report from The Associated Press.

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that the new gold card would replace the currentEB-5 Immigrant Investor visa programwithin two weeks, a program that was created by Congress in 1990 and offers residency to people who spent about $1 million on a business while employing at least 10 people, the report notes.
Trump has also touted the program as a way of trimming the national debt.
""It’s the exact opposite of the Biden administration’s policy. On one side of the curve, we had the mass migrations of unvetted, undocumented immigrants coming in the southern border that were essentially living on the taxpayer dime[.]""
""Companies can go and buy a gold card, and they can use it as a matter of recruitment,"" Trump told reporters Wednesday. ""At the same time, the company is using that money to pay down debt. We’re going to pay down a lot of debt with that.""
Esposito shares Trump’s view for how the money can be used, noting that 1 million gold card recipients would result in $5 trillion for the U.S. Treasury.
""A million individuals coming in would be $5 trillion in payment to the government, off the bat, that doesn’t include the derivative growth of those individuals being here,"" Esposito said.

Nearly 40 other countries have similar so-called ""citizenship by investment"" programs, according to Henley & Partners, a law firm who represents clients looking to use such arrangements. However, the U.S. investment of $5 million proposed by Trump would make the U.S. the most expensive of the group.
Esposito believes allowing such investments would benefit theU.S. economy.
""It is the greatest nation in the world. It is the greatest economy in the world. This is just simply a way of vetting people and having people come in that will create a mutually beneficial relationship…""
""The job growth, the job creation, the taxes paid, the consumer spending, 10 million cards would be $50 trillion. The numbers are real walking in, and the numbers are real as of derivative benefits of these individuals being here,"" Esposito said.
While some critics have expressed fears that the program could be abused or lead to threats to national security, Esposito argued that the Trump administration should be trusted to put the right vetting procedures in place.
""It’s the exact opposite of the Biden administration’s policy. On one side of the curve, we had the mass migrations of unvetted, undocumented immigrants coming in the southern border that were essentially living on the taxpayer dime,"" Esposito said, adding that Trump’s policy would call for ""a program where we have fully vetted the individuals on a personal basis and on an economic basis.""

Ultimately, Esposito says, Trump’s program will cause a ""mutually beneficial"" partnership between the U.S. and gold card holders.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/3-long-term-consequences-from-bidens-cancellation-keystone-pipeline,3 long-term consequences from Biden’s cancellation of the Keystone pipeline,"Fired pipeline worker Bugsy Allen joins ‘America Reports’ to discuss President Donald Trump’s calls to revive the Keystone XL pipeline project.
PresidentDonald Trumpturned heads with his call for restarting the Keystone XL Pipeline. While the energy industry welcomes the new business-friendly administration, the Biden administration’s damage is not easily undone.
Keystone was a privately funded projectconstructing 1,200 miles of pipeline that would have brought 850,000 barrels of crude oil per day from Alberta, Canada, to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refining.
Because it would cross international borders, the U.S. State Department has permitting jurisdiction. In 2015, the Obama State Department approved the project, but President Obama, urged by Secretary of State John Kerry, denied the permits in the name of climate change.

Trump’s reversal resumed construction, but the project was still ongoing whenJoe Bidenwas inaugurated, and on his first day he revoked the permission, putting more than a thousand people out of work.
THE GIGANTIC SLUSH FUND INSIDE THE BIDEN WHITE HOUSE
With Keystone back in the news, here are three long-term consequences Biden’s cancellation caused:
Biden’s cancellation set an ugly and dangerous precedent. The parent company of Keystone XL did not apply for a permit from the Obama State Department, nor did they make a deal with Donald Trump. They reached an agreement with the U.S. government, whose full faith and credit was undermined by Biden.
Obama fueled thedrama around Keystone XLby calling it ""dirty"" and invoking fear of climate change. This labeling could apply to any large-scale construction project: an airport, a nuclear plant, a refinery. Activist groups will always present their ""science,"" and outrage over ""climate justice"" can persuade a fickle future president to undo anything.

That is the precedent Biden set. America’s word hinges on elections.
5 PRIORITIES CRUCIAL TO SUCCESS OF TRUMP’S ENERGY COUNCIL
Part of President Trump’s appeal is that he is not a career politician. He was a businessman and even more pertinent, he was a builder. The private sector understands financial risks in ways government never can.
Look at the $2 billion grant Biden’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made toliberal activist Stacey Abramsfor a new climate nonprofit with zero staff and zero accomplishments. The organizations had only $100 in revenue, and yet it received a taxpayer investment 20 million times earnings. Such a windfall would never happen in the private sector.
Government operatives, whether agency bureaucrats or longtime elected officials, don’t understand the complexities of a project like Keystone. A lifelong politician himself, Biden’s cancellation didn’t come with a ""bailout"" by taxpayers.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST INVEST IN INNOVATION TO REASSERT ENERGY DOMINANCE
Would any company take another risk on a costly project with green crusaders like California Gov. Gavin Newsom and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., looming as wannabe White House hopefuls?
Thepersonal sacrifice energy workersmake for their jobs is often overlooked.  On a 1,200-mile pipeline there are no Zoom meetings, working from home or even a commute home. You live at a camp, or many of the older workers have trailers or campers, and you travel with the project.
Like all construction jobs with an end date, skilled workers are lining up their next projects in advance. There were workers on Keystone who had five years of projected employment, but after Biden’s actions, lost everything at the hands of a guy who called himself ""Scranton Joe.""

Unlike today’s maelstrom of coverage over the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) bringing accountability to government bureaucrats, there was no sympathy or support from the mainstream media.No fawning ""60 Minutes"" segmentor weepy CBS story of a park ranger who lost his ""dream job.""
The Keystone XL workers were necessary casualties in Biden’s effort to save the planet.
Even with Trump in charge, government needs to win back the trust of industry. The federal government could sign an agreement that a cancellation of a project would lead to a refund of costs. Congress could reclaim permitting jurisdiction from the executive branch through well-written legislation.

As a builder, Donald Trump understands the importance of infrastructure projects. The Alaska LNG pipeline will need more than a decade. Proposed LNG pipelines from Pennsylvania to New England will require at least five years.
Businesses are thinking twice before putting billions of dollars on the line. Workers are taking a second look before taking a flyer on a project that a politician could cancel. These are not onlythe lessons of Keystone, but also the sad legacy of Joe Biden and the lasting damage he did to our country.

A new Gallup-Walton Family Foundation survey released Wednesday shows that nearly half of ruralGeneration Z Americansfeel they can't find fulfilling work in their communities and are considering moving.
Rural Gen-Zers are also nearly 20 percentage points more likely to feel that way than their urban brethren.
Urbanyoung peoplealso have a higher confidence in their ability to land crucial internships out of school, and parents of rural youths are similarly concerned about quality-of-life issues for their grown children and in their ability to accomplish their goals.
Forty-nine percent of Gen Zers believe they can find a worthy job at home. Thirty-eight percent say they’re confident in their internship searches.
LGBT AMERICANS REACH RECORD NUMBER, MORE LIKELY TO BE DEMOCRAT: POLL
The pressures of the contemporary occupational landscape are also leading 77% of Gen Z adults to seek to move away from their hometowns, if they are able.
But that feeling is met with countervailing sentiment against leaving home.
More than half of urban Gen Zers say they are comfortable relocating out of state or even outside the U.S., while about half in rural areas prefer to entertain moving to another place within their state, at most.
About two-fifths would consider moving out of state and only a few percent would think to leave the U.S. for a job.
""The desire to stay closer to home contrasts with those in urban areas who are more likely to say they would like to leave their state (54%), or even the country (15%),"" the poll found.
""Career and education opportunities strongly influence young people's decisions to relocate, but rural Gen Zers often face limited access compared to their urban peers,"" said Stephanie Marken, senior partner for U.S. researchat Gallup.
""Expanding access to job training, career opportunities and higher education in rural areas could help more young people stay connected to their communities while pursuing their goals.""
TRUMP'S SURPRISING NEW POLL NUMBERS
Only one-fifth of adult Gen Z Americans who have moved away from their home areas mentioned the ability to live financially comfortably.
Many, however, still love their hometowns despite a changing job landscape in recent years and decades.
The panel was conducted in November, the week of the presidential election.
Pollsters sampled 3,963 people ranging in age from 12 to 27 in all 50 states plus Washington, D.C.
They were randomly selected using an address-based methodology, but the polling firm also said it uses random-digit telephone dialing to cover both landlines and cellphones.
The margin of error was +/- 2.3 percentage points overall. A total of 382 respondents were in rural areas with a 7.3 percentage point margin, and 2,969 were from urban areas with a 2.7 percentage point margin of error.

Despite facing fewer job and education opportunities, rural Gen Zers remain deeply connected to their communities, with their desire to move only slightly numerically higher than their urban peers (82% vs. 78%).
The co-leader of the poll, the Walton Family Foundation, was launched by late Walmart founder Samuel Walton and his wife, Helen.
The foundation seeks to improve the U.S. education system, communities and waterways, particularly in northwest Arkansas, where the family and mega-store chain are both based.

The now-former staffers complained about their DOGE onboarding process after Trump took office.
""Several of these interviewers refused to identify themselves, asked questions about political loyalty, attempted to pit colleagues against each other, and demonstrated limited technical ability,"" the staffers wrote in their letter. ""This process created significant security risks.""

An inmate died in aNew Yorkprison as guards at institutions across the state continue their strike, which is now in its second week.
Jonathon Grant, 61, died over the weekend at one of the prisons where corrections officers walked off the job to strike. National Guard troops were deployed by Gov. Kathy Hochul to fill in during their absence in efforts to alleviate staffing issues.
Grant was pronounced dead Saturday after he was found unresponsive in his cell at the Auburn Correctional Facility. He was serving a 34-to-40-year sentence for rape and burglary.
It's unclear if prison staffing played a role in Grant’s death. The manner in which he died will be determined by a medical examiner.

The public defender’s office that provided legal counsel to Grant expressed concern that the strike may have impacted medical care for inmates.
""Since the strike began, Legal Aid has received dozens of reports from incarcerated clients across New York State about their inability to access critical medical care and essential prescriptions, including blood pressure medication and necessary insulin shots,"" The Legal Aid Society said in a statement. ""This tragic incident highlights the dangers posed by the ongoing strike, as staff in over 40 prisons refuse to fulfill their duties.""
Guards at New York's state prisons began walking out on the job a week ago, even though the move was not approved byunion officials, who acknowledge that it violates a state law prohibiting strikes by most public employees.
A judge has ordered the striking officers to return to work, but they remain on strike.
Woodbourne Correctional Facility inmate Isaiah Waters told The Associated Press that his cell block has been on lockdown for a week. He said four National Guard officers were assigned to his 57-person dorm, along with members of a correctional emergency response unit.

""The tension is building up. I've never seen it like this,"" Waters said. ""There’s no programming, no religious services, you can’t send mail or get visitors. We’re not used to being around each other for this many hours day in and day out.""
Waters, 37, said he expected the situation to worsen.
""They want the atmosphere to become violent to prove a point about staffing,"" he said. ""It’s like we’re caught in the crossfire between the union and their gripes with Albany and the administrators.""
Negotiations between state officials and the New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Association, the union representing the guards, began Monday. Prison workers are seeking better pay, better staffing, improved safety measures and authorization to again begin using solitary confinement as a disciplinary tool.
More than 100 corrections officers and supporters protested Monday near the Coxsackie Correctional Facility in the Hudson Valley. Some carried signs reading ""NYS Failed Us"" and ""Wildcats.""
Retired corrections officer Ed Ventre said the strike was mostly about unsafe working conditions.

""No one has ever seen the amount of violence and disregard for the safety of the officers, not to mention the fact that staffing is at an all-time low and officers are being mandated to work 24 hours straight with the threat of termination should they leave the prison,"" Ventre said.
Assaults on prison system staff jumped from 1,043 in 2019 to 1,938 in the first 11 months of 2024, according to state officials. Meanwhile, assaults on inmates ballooned from 1,267 in 2019 to 2,697 for the first 11 months of 2024.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-chris-coons-trumps-inflationary-policies-making-america-expensive-again,SEN CHRIS COONS: Trump's inflationary policies making America expensive again,"Panelists Trey Gowdy, Francesca Chambers and Josh Kraushaar discuss continued concerns surrounding the state of the economy on ‘Special Report.’
One month into his term, President Trump ismaking America expensive again, and everyone is feeling the pain.
Last year, PresidentDonald Trumpran against inflation, saying when he accepted the Republican presidential nomination last July and throughout his campaign that ""starting on day one, we will drive down prices and make America affordable again.""
His narrow victory in November – the smallest popular vote margin of any winner in more than half a century – was powered by voters eager for him to make good on that promise. In poll after poll before and after the election, the economy and inflation consistently ranked as voters’ top issue.

After one month, we’re beginning to see the directionTrump is taking our economy, and it’s not pretty. Groceries are more expensive than ever. The price of eggs is setting new records every day. Inflation is back over 3% for the first time in eight months. The nonpartisan experts at the Federal Reserve expect inflation to keep rising.
TRUMPONOMICS WILL TAME INFLATION--NOT MAKE IT WORSE
It’s no wonder that there’s only been one president in modern history who has been less popular with the American people after one month in office than Donald Trump is right now: Trump again, back in 2017.
Trump is claiming that this month’s high inflation isn’t his fault, trying to shift the blame back to the Biden administration. Trump wanted credit for the stock market’s surge in November, three months before he was sworn into office, but since the economic news is less rosy now that he’s in office, he’s trying to shift the blame.
In Trump’s world, the buck never stops with him. The American people disagree. In recent polls, almost two-thirds of voters say he isn’t doing enough to address costs. Voters don’t care about who’s responsible. They want the problem solved, and they don’t think Trump is getting it done.
No matter who you blame, it’s a fact that Trump’s policies will only push prices higher going forward. Right now, the biggest contributors to thoserecord-high egg pricesare fears about bird flu, which has infected poultry flocks in all 50 states and already killed at least one American. The administration’s response? Firing U.S. Department of Agriculture employees working to contain the outbreak.
NEW POLL SHOWS WHAT AMERICANS THINK OF TRUMP'S PERFORMANCE IN SECOND TERM
The administration has also defunded and shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, making it easier for big banks to take advantage of average Americans, raising their costs through hidden fines and fees.
Over the coming months, Trump’s policies will continue to push prices higher, none more than his aggressive tariff proposals. He has already imposed an additional 10% tariff on everything we import from China – one of our three largest trading partners. In less than two weeks, he has promised to implement additional25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada– our other two largest trading partners – followed soon after by 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, pharmaceuticals and microchips.
Tariffs are simply a tax that gets passed down to consumers. If a retailer pays an additional 10% or 25% to import a refrigerator or a car, the company is simply going to increase the sticker price at the store. As more of Trump’s tariffs go into effect, costs will rise on everything from the Canadian lumber we use to build our houses to Mexican tomatoes and lemons we buy at the supermarket.

The tariffs will be Trump’s most inflationary policy in the coming months, but many of his other hallmark policies aren’t much better.
We do need to secure our border, but mass deportations will send the costs of food and housing skyrocketing once we’ve removed half of our farmworkers and a fifth of our construction workers. Repealing the Inflation Reduction Act, as Trump has repeatedly said he wants to do, will eliminate the $35 per month cap on insulin prices for seniors and raise prescription drug prices across the board for millions of Americans.
Meanwhile, Trump’s policies that are supposed to curb rising costs are unlikely to be successful. He has claimed he’s going to bring down the cost of energy by increasing oil production, but it will be hard to go much higher than the record levels of oil and gas production set during the Biden administration.

The Trump administration’s disastrousattempts to cut government spendingwon’t help with inflation either: as DOGE fires food safety inspectors and air traffic controllers, the chaos in the marketplace will drive prices up.
All of this is bad news for Americans who just want cheaper groceries. Trump’s first month hasn’t gone well. Unless he changes direction, it’s only going to get worse.

President Donald Trump turned his attention tothe Keystone XL Pipelineon Monday evening, calling for the company building it to ""come back to America, and get it built — NOW!""
Trump said he was ""just thinking"" about how construction on the pipeline was ""viciously jettisoned by the incompetent Biden Administration,"" and promised things are different now under his leadership.
""I know they were treated very badly by Sleepy Joe Biden, but the Trump Administration is very different — Easy approvals, almost immediate start! If not them, perhaps another Pipeline Company. We want the Keystone XL Pipeline built!""
The pipeline has been at the forefront of political debate since the project began construction in 2010, and was eventually halted by former President Barack Obama before it was finished. Trump revived it during his first term.

However,former President Joe Bidenordered the pipeline cancelation via executive order on his first day in office in January 2021, leading to thousands of job losses.
TC Energy, the operator of the Keystone XL pipeline, ultimately gave up on the project in June 2021 as a result of Biden's decision to cancel its federal permits.
Then, in 2023, a federal judge tossed a legal challenge from nearly two dozen states asking the court to reinstate the pipeline's permits.

The pipeline had been scheduled to becompleted in early 2023and would transport an additional 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Canada to the U.S. through an existing pipeline network, according to TC Energy. It was also projected to create thousands of jobs, many of which would have been union jobs.
In December 2022, the Biden administration's Department of Energy (DOE) published a report that said the Keystone XL project would have created between 16,149 and 59,000 jobs and would have had a positive economic impact of between $3.4 and $9.6 billion, citing various studies.

The system was designed to carry oil from Alberta to states like Illinois, Texas and Oklahoma.
In January, Danielle Smith, the premier of Alberta, Canada, said that she was interested in talking to theTrump administrationabout potentially reopening the pipeline project.

""Restarting the Keystone XL pipeline aligns with President Trump’s agenda to lower food and energy costs by bolstering North American energy infrastructure and reducing reliance on costly imports,"" Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute (AEI), previously told Fox News Digital.
Another expert said that Trump will likely face litigation if he chooses to proceed with construction of the pipeline, but that Congress could help limit legal action.

In 2024,candidate Donald Trump ran for presidentas someone who cared about the average worker in America. But during his first month in office, he has fallen head over heels for the billionaire class and forgotten the people who elected him. Right from the start, President Trump handed our government over to the richest man on the planet, Elon Musk, and gave him access to all our most sensitive, personal data so that Musk can use that exclusive access to make himself even richer.
Even worse, Trump and Musk have launched a dizzying series of assaults on low- and middle-income workers, making clear that this billionaire takeover of our government will leave American workers even more powerless than they were before.
And it’s not just Musk –Trump has surrounded himself with a band of billionaires who could not be more out of touch with the everyday experience of most Americans. The federal minimum wage has been the same since 2009: $7.25. Sixty-two percent of Americans support raising the minimum wage to $15 because they agree if you work a full-time job, you shouldn’t be living at or below the poverty level.
'ONLY TAKES 3': DEMS PUSH PERSONAL DATA PROTECTION TO TURN GOP AGAINST ELON MUSK'S DOGE
You know who doesn’t agree? Trump and his billionaire cabinet. His newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent – net worth $521 million – made it clear during his confirmation hearing that he believes workers don’t deserve a raise in the embarrassingly low national wage floor.

It only took one week for Trump to set his sights ondestroying labor unions,where many workers join together to bargain for higher wages and better working conditions. Trump’s first target was the agency responsible for protecting workers’ rights, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
The NLRB conducts union elections, investigates allegations of unfair labor practices, and protects workers from being exploited by their employers, all of which enrages billionaires like Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Musk. The NLRB can’t operate with less than three of its five members. So, what did Trump do? He paralyzed it by firing NLRB member Gwynne Wilcox, who had another three years left in her term. With just two members left, the board has been rendered completely toothless and unable to order parties to pay remedies or recognize a union.
But it’s certainly not surprising, with Musk in charge. Musk has always hated workers. He made that point very clear, outright declaring ""I disagree with the idea of unions,"" and he’s successfully fought tooth and nail to block Tesla workers from ever forming one.
Tesla is the only major U.S. car manufacturer whose workers aren’t represented by a union, and they are worse off because of it. Tesla employees make about 30% less than workers at GM and Ford, who are unionized through the UAW. And before Trump killed the NLRB, Musk’s companies were the subject of 24 investigations for alleged labor violations. Now he has free rein to mistreat his workers.
We know what comes next because Trump has spent the first month in office executing a radical plan to hand government over to the billionaires. It’s called Project 2025, and this anti-worker, pro-corporate plan previews what’s ahead.
Project 2025 outlined an end to all project labor agreement requirements, which protect good-paying union jobs, and a repeal of Davis-Bacon, which assures that construction jobs using taxpayer dollars pay a living wage to construction workers.
Even worse, Project 2025 calls for limiting when workers receive overtime pay to only when they work more than 80 hours in two weeks. If you work 60 hours one week and 20 the next week, you won’t get the overtime pay you earned in the first week.
Trump and Musk have also spent their first weeks in office relentlessly demonizing federal workers. These are the people who inspect our food to make sure it’s safe, provide medical care to veterans, administer Social Security payments and process passports. Four out of five federal workers live and work outside the D.C. area. Before he was confirmed, Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russ Vought said, ""We want to put [federal workers] in trauma.""
House Democrats were blocked from entering the Department of Education building in Washington, Feb. 7, 2025.(Fox News)
The greatest insult to workers will be the giant tax and spending bill that Trump and congressional Republicans are pushing through Congress. It cuts taxes for billionaires, millionaires and corporations, and to pay for those tax giveaways, Republicans are going to gut the programs that help minimum-wage workers and their families, like Medicaid.

Medicaid pays for most nursing home beds in the country, where the parents of hard-working Americans spend their final days. Those nursing home beds will disappear, and working families will face bankruptcy, having to shoulder all the cost of expensive acute care for their loved one.
All of these attacks on workers happening at the same time, aren’t a big coincidence. Trump has decided to empower the ruling class – the billionaires, the big corporate CEOs, the financial firm titans – and gut protections and services for everyone else.
We know what comes next because Trump has spent the first month in office executing a radical plan to hand government over to the billionaires. It’s called Project 2025, and this anti-worker, pro-corporate plan previews what’s ahead.
Musk doesn’t care about helping working people because his priority is using his newly purchased power to make money off his control of government. He used his role at the White House to get a meeting with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi so he could talk about opening a Tesla factory in India and shipping jobs overseas.

He shut down the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so he can turn X into an unregulated payments app. He destroyed USAID to give China, where he manufactures half of his cars, more power on the world’s stage. Unsurprisingly, Musk's personal net worth has increased $130 billion since the election.
Trump might have run as someone who cared about regular people, but he’s governing like someone obsessed with one, singular idea: steal from workers in order to enrich the very, very wealthy and the corporate class. Every day Americans see more proof of Trump’s blind loyalty to members of his own billionaire clique and his abandonment of the working-class voters who supported him last November. The evidence is stacking up and increasingly impossible to ignore.

As a pastor, I see firsthand every day the fundamental reality thatfamilies need strong communities,including Christian communities, and that communities, including Christian communities, need strong families.
This is one of the reasons I look at issues and proposals through the ""lens"" of the family. Does something help or harm families? Does it help strengthen families, bringing them closer together, rooting them deeper in their communities and helping them raise their children, or does it fragment families and make the tasks of raising children and being rooted in wider communities harder?
I also ask, particularly in this time of falling birth rates, whether it helps men and women form families. Of course, there are many dimensions and factors at play, many issues on which we have to ask this question. One of these is government policy, and some might rightly point out there are more influential factorsthan what government does.That’s true, and it would be a mistake to see government as the sole cause of or the only solution to all the challenges facing working families in America.
PARENTS COULD SEE UP TO $12,000 CHILD TAX REFUND UNDER NEW BIPARTISAN HOUSE BILL
But, it would be equally a mistake to think that government policy doesn’t matter or has very little effect on working families, including those I serve in my community. This new administration has a timely opportunity to help working families through the tax code. In particular, the administration has an opportunity to strengthen the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and make the process to claim it simpler, saving millions of working families valuable time and money.

The CTC is a tax credit for working families with children. It’s directly connected to work, so the more you work the better. Back in 2017,the credit was doubledby President Donald Trump to $2,000 per child, a majority of which is refundable based on the family's earned income. Yet, $2,000 today buys far less than it did in 2017, meaning the CTC has been greatly weakened by the sky-high costs of raising a family — an everyday challenge for so many of those I serve.
Indeed, the American people know this; according to a recent poll, 81% support adjusting the CTC every year to account for the rising cost of living, and 74% think it should be raised (from the current $2,000) to $5,000 per child. In addition, a full 78% support some form of ""baby bonus"" to help families with a newborn.

This would be a pro-family and pro-family formation policy that could provide something like a $2,000 per-parent ""baby bonus"" that parents could receive direct to their bank account with the child’s Social Security card, typically two to four weeks after their child is born. That makes it immediately helpful for post-birth expenses and to support parents in those wonderful (but sleep-deprived!) first few weeks after birth.
Our communities, our nation, need strong families and working families need a strong CTC and other policies like the baby bonus to support them in those crucial early years. Indeed, Vice President JD Vance’s call for a $5,000 CTC is a great place to start. We can also help working families by providing optional flexibility in how it’s claimed and making sure it’s linked to inflation, so it doesn’t lose its value again.
The administration also has an opportunity to use tools and technology to help make sure all eligible working families are aware of the credit and easily able to claim it. This should be a part of a new and appropriate focus on customer service across government, including at the Internal Revenue Service. After all, government exists to serve citizens, not the other way around. Working families shouldn’t need a tax professional or to spend hours and hundreds of dollars to claim these critical credits like the CTC and the Earned Income Tax Credit.

The administration is off to a good start, with Trump’s nominee to head the Treasury Department, Scott Bessent, testifying that one of the current free filing programs at the IRS, Direct File, will continue to be available this tax-filing season for working families to file their taxes. It is free to file and enables working families to see if they are eligible for the Child Tax Credit (as well as other credits) and, if eligible, helps them claim the credits and file their Federal taxes.
It’s been said a community’s future passes through its families, so if we want strong neighborhoods, friendly communities, effective education and high-quality jobs, we need strong working families who are raising the next generation of neighbors, educators, employers and pastors!

There is a futuristic city designed and built from the ground up in Japan to test the latest technologies.
It's called Woven City, and it's a boldexperiment by Toyotato transition from being just an automaker to a broader mobility company focused on the future of movement.
Far from a traditional testing ground, this is a fully functional urban environment designed for real people to live, work and play while contributing to groundbreaking research.

Woven City(Toyota)
Think ofWoven Cityas a real-world laboratory. This is a place where inventors, residents and visitors come together to test and refine innovations in a city that's, well, actually lived in. According to Toyota Chairman Akio Toyoda, it's ""a place where people can invent and develop all kinds of new products and ideas … a living laboratory.""
It's Toyota's ambitious project to create a test bed for autonomous vehicles, smart homes, robotics andartificial intelligence, all within a carefully designed urban environment. The aim is really to become a ""mobility company"" that focuses on the movement of people, goods, information and energy.

CHINA'S UNVEILS THE WORLD’S FASTEST HIGH-SPEED TRAIN WITH A TOP SPEED OF 280 MPH
Woven City isn't just for robots and tech; it's designed for people. The initial residents, expected to move in this fall, will be around 100 strong, primarily Toyota and ""WbyT"" (Woven by Toyota) employees and their families. The community will then expand to around 360 residents during its first phase. Eventually, the city plans to house around 2,000 people, including inventors, weavers and visitors.
""Inventors"" include Toyota employees, startups and entrepreneurs focused on mobility solutions. ""Weavers"" are residents and visitors who will collaborate with inventors by testing new products and services. There are already several partner companies involved, including a soft drink company, a coffee company, an instant noodle company, an air-conditioning company and an educational company.
Woven City(Toyota)
ARE THESE AUTONOMOUS TRANSPORT PODS THE FUTURE OF SKY-HIGH COMMUTING?
Woven City's design incorporates a unique street system, separating traffic based on speed and usage to promote safety and efficiency. There are three types of streets:
Dedicated to faster vehicles:This lane is designated for autonomous vehicles and is optimized for the efficient and safe movement of goods and people.
Mixed-use street:This lane allows for a mix of lower-speed mobility, such as bicycles, scooters and other personal mobility devices, alongside pedestrians.
Pedestrian-only park:Designed exclusively for pedestrians.
This layered approach ensures a balanced environment where different modes of transportation can coexist safely and sustainably, reflecting Woven City's human-centered design philosophy.
Woven City(Toyota)
The heart of Woven City is ""co-creation."" It's about bringing together diverse groups of people to develop human-centered solutions for societal challenges. Instead of testing in isolated labs, inventors can see how their products integrate into daily life.
To support this, Woven City offers the ""Woven Inventor Garage,"" providing access to cutting-edge technologies. One cool example is the ""Digital Twin,"" a virtual simulation of the city where inventors can model scenarios and test products on a digital platform before deploying them in the real world.
WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

It's interesting to note that Toyota's roots aren't just in cars. The company's founder, Sakichi Toyoda, revolutionized the textile industry with inventions that eased his mother's work on a manual loom. This ""for others"" philosophy continues to drive Toyota's initiatives, from automobiles to Woven City.
Woven City signifies Toyota's commitment to shaping the future of mobility and creating a better world through innovation. As the first residents move in and the city continues to evolve, it will be interesting to watch how this ""living laboratory"" redefines what's possible.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/we-replaced-families-uncle-sam-doge-must-make-right-choices-when-cutting,We replaced families with Uncle Sam. DOGE must make the right choices when cutting,"Fox News correspondent Mark Meredith joins 'Fox & Friends' to explain President Donald Trump ending taxpayer benefits for illegal immigrants and the president weighing sending DOGE savings checks to taxpayers.
If we want a smaller government, we need stronger families.
President Donald Trump’s efforts to shrink the size and scope of government through theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)has the potential to change the trajectory of the nation. But Trump can’t deliver this promise only by cutting wasteful spending. American taxpayers have been forced to fund DEI programs in Europe, drag shows in Ecuador, and electric vehicle experiments in Asia — turning off this tap won’t be enough.
Soon, the path torestoring fiscal health in Americais going to lead the administration down much more politically treacherous paths – ones that may include trimming government programs that millions of Americans use.
If this causes us to panic, we ought to ask the obvious question: why are so many millions of Americans reliant on programs like housing assistance, food stamps and government-funded healthcare? In fact, a big part of the answer is that the decline of marriage and thecollapse of familieshas fueled much of our nation’s large-scale dependence on government to meet too many of our basic needs.
Our nation has outsourced the key functions of family to the state and that isn't working.(iStock)
In order for DOGE to navigate these waters and accomplish its massive ambition, it will have to think along deeper lines than trimming staff and wasteful programs from the federal government. It will have to relinquish government power back to smaller units: families, communities and states.
The Center for Christian Virtue and the Institute for Family Studies recently collaborated on a new study called ""The Hope and a Future Report."" This report takes a deep dive into how decreasing marriage rates, especially among the low-income Ohioans, are driving poverty, academic failure and violence in our communities – all of which drive the growth of government.
Consider child poverty: In Youngstown Ohio, 68% of children are living in homes without a married father. Fifty percent of Youngstown children are in poverty.
From there, the data tracks on nearly a straight line down: in Vice President JD Vance’s hometown of Middletown, Ohio, 51% of children are living in unmarried homes, with 26% of kids in poverty.
Then you have New Albany, Ohio, where 91% of children are being raised in a married home, and a mere 4% child poverty rate. More broadly, what we see is that children in single-mother families are four times more likely to be poor in Ohio than children in married families.
For DOGE, and any leader interested in scaling back the size of government at the federal or state level, child poverty is their scourge. Children in poverty are far more likely to rely on government services not just today, but long into the future.
Again, look to Ohio for a case study. In Republican Gov. Mike DeWine’s projected 2025 budget, the state Office of Budget and Management says Ohio is expecting to receive $25.5 billion dollars from the federal government – the majority of this for Medicaid, a program specifically for low-income children, families and adults.
In fact, family breakdown is deeply tied to the three biggest items in state spending. Typical state budgets do three things: education, health and human services and law and order. They educate, they medicate and they incarcerate.
One of the big thing governments spend money on is incarceration. FILE: Kern Valley State Prison in California(Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)
A staggering 88.4% of Ohio’s budget is spent on these three areas and all three are more expensive for taxpayers when kids aren’t born into the ideal and most stable environment. That’s because school failure, child poverty and antisocial behavior are significantly more common for children and families in non-intact families.
Children from non-intact families in Ohio are 72% more likely to have their parents contacted by a teacher or principal at their school for behavioral or learning problems, compared to children from intact, married families, according to an IFS-CCV analysis of the National Survey of Children’s Health.

Included in the Hope and a Future Report is a first-ever Family Structure Index which ranks all 50 states according to the health of their family culture. The Index analyzes demographic and fertility data to investigate which states are home to the strongest, most stable and most sustainable families.
Unsurprisingly, we see a connection between healthy and stable families and the economic well-being of a state. Seven of the top 10 states in the Family Structure Index are also in the top 10 in the American Legislative Exchange Commissions Laffer State Economic Outlook Rankings of 2024, which analyzes the states with the lowest tax and regulatory policies. In other words, one reason states like Utah, Idaho and South Dakota are doing so well economically and fiscally is that they also have some of the strongest families in the nation.
For DOGE, and any leader interested in scaling back the size of government at the federal or state level, child poverty is their scourge. Children in poverty are far more likely to rely on government services not just today, but long into the future.
Elon Musk, who is currently overseeing Trump’s DOGE, has been a great advocate for half of the family solution here: that we should celebrate children. But, judging by his own approach to family formation, he doesn’t seem to appreciate how much marriage matters for our kids and our country.

In order to protect these children from poverty and to keep them from ultimately becoming dependent on the government, we first need to encourage marriage. This not only best serves the kids, but over the coming years will make federal and state government far more efficient than even Musk’s wildest dreams.

Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., and Teamsters president Sean O’Brien discuss coming together after their fight on the congressional floor.
President Donald Trump has helped a GOP lawmaker and national union leader finally squash their feud after making headlines in 2023 for theirverbal spat on the Senate floor, telling each other to ""stand"" their ""butt(s) up,"" during an argument.
Sen.Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., and Teamsters President Sean O’Brienmade headlines in November 2023 for their heated argument after the representative confronted the union boss on his critical tweets.
Now, the two men say President Trump has brought them together after a phone call.
""Even after President Trump and Sean O'Brien sat down and talked, one of the first phone calls he made was to me and said, 'Hey Markwayne, I think you guys will get along. You guys need to talk because I think we got a place for the unions to come in and it starts with Sean. Why don't you guys just sit down and break bread together?' Sean and I broke bread together for the first time, and we have truly built a friendship ever since then,"" Sen. Markwayne Mullin told ""Hannity"" on Thursday.
The pair is now joining together to endorse Trump nominee Lori Chavez-DeRemer.
""We are working very hard, both of us, to do what's right for the American worker,""Teamsters presidentSean O’Brien told Fox News. ""Now, we can agree to disagree on right to work. We can agree to disagree on the Pro Act, but the task at hand right now is getting Lori Chavez-DeRemer confirmed, and we're going to work together. Look, we did have a fight. We did have an argument, but it is what it is. It's in the past.""

Following PresidentDonald Trumpdeclaring a national energy emergency on his first day in office, he recently followed through on another commitment by establishing the National Energy Dominance Council.
The council has the potential to create more than a ""Golden Era"" forAmerican energy affordability, reliability and security. Its work is likely to contribute to unprecedented economic development opportunities for Americans while providing our diplomats and peacemakers with important assets to help solve geopolitical challenges that make the world safer.

President Donald Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright(Getty Images/Reuters)
While much of the focus is properly centered on addressing the imperative of leadership for artificial intelligence and data centers, the demand drivers are much broader.
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S PRO-ENERGY AGENDA WILL UNLEASH AMERICAN JOBS AND ENERGY SECURITY
Simply stated, America and the worldneed a lot more electricity. Who provides it will determine prosperity at home and abroad. And, importantly, who builds and innovates the technology for electricity will win the space race of our generation.
As the CEO of America’s leading electricity manufacturer, with 18,000 U.S. employees at 18 U.S. factories building gas turbines, nuclear power plants, critical grid equipment and software, and renewable equipment, I believe the Energy Council can win for the U.S. and globally. To do so, my strongest advice is for the Council to put U.S. manufacturing at its core and consider these five priorities:
Expand U.S. baseload energy:Immediate progress can be made by simply improving what we already have. For example, in North America technology upgrades can be added to just one class of our industrial gas turbines that will add 14 gigawatts to our system. Upgrading nuclear and restarting decommissioned sites can add 2GW. And my company is ready to upgrade 35,000 onshore wind turbines so they can produce more energy from where they stand today.
The Energy Council can then go beyond the existing base to accelerate new baseload by deploying state-of-the-art gas andnuclear technologymanufactured in U.S. factories with sound policy, permit streamlining and partnership with the private sector.
THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MUST INVEST IN INNOVATION TO REASSERT ENERGY DOMINANCE
Grow the grid:President Trump’s executive orders and his Cabinet have put more emphasis on the need to build the grid than we’ve ever seen. They are right to do so. Our grid is the unsung hero of our energy system and the ""central nervous system"" of our energy infrastructure.
But even heroes have vulnerabilities – and our grid needs immediate help. The Council can secure our energy backbone by partnering with the private sector to modernize and build strategic reserves of critical grid equipment, growing factories and jobs along the way, and approaching the hardening of the grid with a security mindset.
Treat energy through a competitive lens:To truly achieve the president’s goals for ""the next century,"" energy innovation and competitiveness are key. Beyond our baseload needs, we are also building the world’s leading ""all of the above"" technologies in the United States, critical not only for getting as many affordable electrons on the grid as possible, but to maintain U.S. leadership in all energy technologies.
The focus of the council should go beyond what we can do today and includefuture breakthrough technologiessuch as small modular reactors and carbon capture systems. If we don’t lead the innovation in the U.S., others will, and the Energy Council is well positioned to enable U.S. leadership in the near term while innovating for the future.
TRUMP ENERGY PLAN WILL AVOID EUROPE’S ENERGY DISASTER
Build it in the U.S.President Trump is right to talk about unleashing U.S. energy. But it’s not just the electrons and molecules that matter. The true foundation to energy dominance is U.S. manufacturing and industrial capacity. We need to build on that legacy.
After all, the first electrification revolution started with Thomas Edison innovating in upstate New York. Today, the technology we build in places like Greenville, South Carolina, Pensacola, Florida, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, is among the most sophisticated equipment made anywhere.
The Energy Council can unlock the next U.S. manufacturing renaissance with the right policies, including manufacturing and energy production tax credits, ensuring prosperity for American workers and competitive strength globally for America.

Solve geopolitical challenges:President Trump has uniquely spoken about the opportunity for U.S. energy assets to solve conflicts and bring prosperity to the world. As a company whose equipment helps provide 25% of the world’s electricity in more than 100 countries, we see the opportunity every day for energy to be at the foundation of peace and prosperity. I recommend the council consider both energy and the equipment that generates electricity alongside each other as they advance this important mission.
President Trump’s Energy Councilis the right opportunity in the right place at the right time to help ensure American leadership and geopolitical prosperity at the beginning of an electrification supercycle that can reshape economies. The opportunity for U.S. factories, workers and innovation to truly lead this effort brings me great optimism that we will win.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-doge-stays-track-after-pair-federal-judge-rulings,Trump's DOGE stays on track after pair of federal judge rulings,"Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump is looking at taking over control of Washington D.C. and cleaning up the city on ‘Jesse Watters Primetime.’
Twofederal judgesdeclined this week to stop the Trump administration from firing federal workers and conducting mass layoffs, allowing the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to remain on track with finding and slashing wasteful government spending.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper shot down a request from several federal labor unions, including the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), to issue a pause on the mass firings of federal workers by theTrump administration.
NTEU and four other labor unions representing federal employees – the National Federation of Federal Employees; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers; the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers; and the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America – filed a complaint on Feb. 12, challenging the firing of probationary employees and the deferred resignation program.
The resignation program presented federal employees with a fork in the road, meaning they could either return to the office or they could resign from their positions and continue to get paid through September, though they had to decide by Feb. 6. That date was ultimately deferred to Feb. 12, then subsequently closed that day.

The unions moved for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) and preliminary injunction to prevent the firing of probationary employees across all federal agencies and furtherance of the resignation program on Feb. 14, and the next day it was sent to Cooper’s court.
Cooper denied the request, though, saying the court lacks jurisdiction over the unions’ claims.
Instead, Cooper ruled the unions must pursue their challenges through the Federal ServiceLabor-Management RelationsStatute, which provides for administrative review by the Federal Labor Relations Authority.
JUDGE EXTENDS RESTRAINING ORDER TO BAN TRUMP ADMIN BUYOUT OFFER TO FEDERAL WORKERS
In a separate case, 14 states asked U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan to issue a TRO preventing billionaire Elon Musk and DOGE from accessing data systems at the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Department of Education, Department of Labor, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Energy, Department of Transportation and Department of Commerce for 14 days after the order is issued.
The plaintiffs also asked Chutkan’s order to forbidMusk and DOGEfrom terminating, furloughing, or putting on leave, any federal officers, or employees in those agencies.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/massachusetts-teachers-union-disavows-offensive-images-after-being-accused-antisemitism,Massachusetts teachers' union disavows 'offensive images' after being accused of spreading antisemitism,"Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas reports on an investigation into the Massachusetts teachers’ union over claims it circulated antisemitic learning materials to its members.
The Massachusetts Teachers Association (MTA) is removing links to websites with controversial materials after being accused of spreading antisemitism.
A local hearing became a national news story as MTA president Max Page was grilled over the union sharing educational resources that contained offensive images criticizing Israel.
The images included a dollar bill folded into a Star of David alongside criticism offoreign aid to Israel,a poster showing what appears to be an armed Palestinian with the words ""What was taken by force can only be returned by force,"" and a children’s book referring to Zionists as a ""group of bullies.""
Gov. Maura Healeyspoke about the controversydirectly, saying, ""The images on the Massachusetts Teachers Association website were antisemitic, offensive and never should have been shared in the first place. I spoke to MTA leadership about my concerns and am glad they will be removing the images — that should be done immediately.""

She added, ""I understand the importance of making sure teachers and educators have guidance for how to discuss this complex issue. That's why it was important for these images to be removed so that everyone can come together to determine how to accurately and appropriately address this topic moving forward. I want to thank the members of Special Commission on Combatting Antisemitism for their commitment and dedication on this issue, and that important work continues.""
OUTRAGED STAFF, PARENTS SLAM MINNESOTA TEACHERS UNION'S ‘ANTISEMITIC, HOSTILE STANCE ON ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR’
Page and union vice president Deb McCarthy responded with a public statement, declaring the MTA ""defends the right of all students and teachers to feel supported and included in our classrooms and unequivocally condemns antisemitism and Islamophobia and all other forms of hatred and discrimination.""
The Massachusetts-based union leaders claimed that their members-only website had a wide variety of resources to explain the historically complex conflict in the Middle East, ""and includes materials from the Anti-Defamation League, the United StatesHolocaust MemorialMuseum, Facing History and Ourselves, the New York Times, the NEA, and many other respected sources.""
They also pushed back against some of their critics, specifying that controversial images discussed at the recent hearing were never displayed directly on the members-only website.
MTA President Max Page was grilled at the hearing about content accessed via links on the MTA's member's only website.

""As trusted educators, MTA members would never want to have antisemitic materials on the MTA website, and the MTA does not promote materials that direct hate at any group. We will remove any materials that do not further the cause of promoting understanding,"" the union leaders wrote.
""Images displayed at a Feb. 10 hearing by the Special Commission on Combatting Antisemitism are not posted on the MTA’s website, but rather on outside websites, which are linked to the resources page. The links to the sites containing those offensive images will be removed.""
The local ADL chapter in New England praised the MTA’s decision as a ""welcome first step.""

""The @Massteacher decision to remove harmful content from its list of curricular resources is a welcome first step toward restoring confidence,"" the local branch of the ADL said on X. ""In light of the significant problems highlighted at last week’s commission hearing aboutspecific antisemitic resourcesand the biased nature of the list, we urge @Massteacher to take affirmative steps to objectively vet its resources for bias and pedagogical soundness and make any future version of this list public for full transparency.""

https://www.foxnews.com/media/obama-economist-concedes-bidenomics-fell-short-lofty-goals,"Obama economist calls out Bidenomics in op-ed, says it fell short of 'lofty goals'","Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss his take on President Biden's final interview, the state of confirmation for Trump's nominees and his effort to help the incoming administration to ban offshore wind projects.
Former Obama economist Jason Furman wrote in an op-ed that formerPresident Joe Biden's economic policy fell short of its goals, criticizing the Biden administration's economic policies as a ""tragedy.""
""The Biden administration’s post-neoliberal turn, the predicted economic transformations of which prompted comparisons to Franklin Roosevelt’s presidency, fell considerably short of its lofty goals,""Furman wrotein Foreign Affairs Magazine, conceding that while some macroeconomic outcomes were impressive, ""the recovery has been uneven, frustrated by inflation at least partly induced by the administration’s own policies.""
Furman, an economic advisor for Obama, was critical of some of Biden's policies during his term, includingBiden's student loan forgiveness, and as former Vice President Kamala Harris became the Democratic nominee, he criticizedher idea for price controlsto curb inflation and lower prices.
""Biden’s supporters and policymakers, especially those who have denied the effects of inflation, insisted that voters grossly misunderstood the economy or attributed Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss in the 2024 presidential election solely to a global rejection of incumbents,"" the economist wrote.

FORMER OBAMA ECONOMIST REJECTS INFLATION HAPPY TALK: NOT ‘GOING AWAY ANYTIME SOON’
The economist argued that Biden's ""Build Back Better"" agenda failed to address the immediate concerns of the electorate.
""It is possible that just the portion of inflation caused by global shocks would have been enough to doom any incumbent party’s reelection chances. But adding to that inflation with unnecessary spending, minimizing the suffering it caused, and touting an imaginary boom in infrastructure and manufacturing surely did not help Democrats,"" he continued.
Furmanspoke to Politicoabout the article and explained why he chose to write it now, as Trump is now the president.
""And I also looked, as the administration ended, and frankly saw a lot of people who I didn’t think were drawing on the right lessons of the last four years. They thought it was just bad luck: global inflation, all incumbents are losing, what he did was actually all great from beginning to end. And I thought taking the right lesson, stepping back, tying it together, doing an after-action report is really important,"" he told the outlet.

Furman said Biden's policies on infrastructure had been a ""failure.""
""A huge amount of money flooded into it. In some ways it made it even harder to build with the number of requirements put on programs,"" he told Politico. ""All of this drove up costs so much that the money that got spent was basically swallowed up by the higher costs, and then a lot of the money hasn’t even been spent.""
Furman detailed his critiquesof the administration's infrastructure law, which was passed in 2021, in his Foreign Affairs op-ed, arguing that the ""Law did little to address the root causes of the United States’ long-standing infrastructure unaffordability problem,"" and said the costs of construction left the U.S. ""building less"" than it was prior to the law passing.
Jared Bernstein, one of Biden's top economic advisors, rejected Furman's criticismsin two Substack posts.

""Many of these claims are wrong and many fail to recognize economic input from CEA [Council of Economic Advisers] and others that Jason would recognize as sound. Jason devalues remarkably positive economic outcomes from our tenure, and ignores important contributions we made to the living standards of vulnerable families. There are also cases where politics pushed us toward sub-optimal policies, and where we did the best we could with the cards we held,"" Bernstein wrote.
Bernstein also acknowledged that his economic team made mistakes, despite taking issue with Furman's critiques. In another post published on Wednesday, Bernstein wrote that Furman ""had to know he was giving powerful ammunition to an opposition that, whatever his beefs about us, is incomparably worse on all the economic issues he’s worried about.""
Biden's team declined to comment on Furman's op-ed.

A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced a bill that would give parents up to $6,000 per child in expanded tax credits.
It's part of a wider piece of legislation called the Affordable Childcare Act, led by Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., and Ryan Mackenzie, R-Pa., on the right and Sharice Davids, D-Kan., and Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., on the left.
Both the Republican and Democratic campaigns had called for an expanded child tax credit during the 2024 presidential race, whereboth sides attemptedto make inroads with families struggling to afford care.
SCOOP: KEY CONSERVATIVE CAUCUS DRAWS RED LINE ON HOUSE BUDGET PLAN

The current child tax credit levels give parents a refund of up to $2,000 for dependents under age 17. Adults with incomes that exceed $200,000 as a single filer or $400,000 for married couples can still be eligible for a partial credit.
The bipartisan bill would raise the maximum threshold to $6,000 for one dependent and $12,000 for two or more.
It would also double the tax credit for businesses that facilitate childcare for employees, raising the amount to $300,000 per year for qualifying workplaces.

During the most recent White House campaign, now-Vice President JD Vance and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was running for the top of the ticket, called for a $5,000 and $6,000 child tax credit, respectively.
But it's not certain Congress will find an appetite towork together onsuch a bill now, given bitter divisions over the government funding process and PresidentDonald Trump'scrackdown on government spending.
Republicans are also working on a larger tax package that they're aiming to pass with only GOP votes via the budget reconciliation process.
Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which Republicans are hoping to extend with reconciliation, raised the maximum child tax credit from $1,000 at the time to $2,000.

If Congress fails to extend Trump's tax cuts by the end of 2025, the original parameters would be back in place.
The maximum was briefly raised to $3,000 for children ages 6 to 16 and $3,600 for children ages 0 to 5 to help families cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, but those rates were not extended.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/college-football-seeks-key-tax-exemption-athletes-recruitment-team-continuity,"College football country seeks key tax exemption for athletes to enhance recruitment, boost team continuity","Auburn University honors America’s fallen heroes with a memorial.
Whether their fans are cheering""Roll Tide,""""War Eagle,"" ""Go Dawgs"" or even ""Texas, Fight!"", lawmakers across the Deep South are working on legislation to exempt student-athletes’ name-image-likeness (NIL) income from taxation.
Proponents say the move will boost recruitment abilities for their schools – thereby bringing in the needed financial boost to academics – and also level the playing field for colleges that are not in states which have no income tax in general.
In Alabama, the state lawmaker representing Auburn told Fox News Digital he’s put forth legislation that would exempt any NIL income from the state’s income tax.
GOP state Rep. Joe Lovvorn said that with Georgia working on similar legislation, it was important for him to get Alabama on track to do the same.
ALABAMA GOV SIGNS ‘WHAT IS A WOMAN’ ACT

""Until there is some level of uniformity across the board, states will need to do whatever they can to ensure their colleges and universities are in a position to succeed,"" Lovvorn said. ""I hope this situation serves as another reminder to Congress and the NCAA that national standards governing NIL and the transfer portal are needed sooner rather than later.""
Just across the Chattahoochee River, Georgia lawmakers are continuing to pursue their legislation, with one noted Dawgs-fan lawmaker saying he was happy to see the state’s Saturday rival follow suit.
State Sen. Brandon Beach, R-Alpharetta, quipped that college football is a ""religion"" in the Southeast, particularly among the SEC schools.
""As far as the athletes being paid, the genie is out of the bottle… We just need to make sure we have some guardrails or something and so on in place to make sure that it's just not the Wild, Wild West. And that's what's going on right now,"" said Beach, who is leading Georgia’s version of the legislation.

Another consideration in Atlanta is the fact that other SEC schools are located in states without an income tax at all – including Tennessee and Texas A&M.
""I'm not saying that's the reason they made the college playoffs, but they are able to get five-star athletes and be competitive and put a good product on the field -- what I want to do is, provide a good product to offer.""
Beach said that, as of late, too many star athletes are transferring schools, comparing that dynamic to the past when players were iconically associated with their schools because of their longevity with the program.
He cited Eli Manning and Ole Miss, Peyton Manning and Tennessee, and Matthew Stafford and Georgia, in that regard.
Conversely, he cited reports the tax factor played into college quarterback Carson Beck’s transferfrom the Bulldogsto the University of Miami Hurricanes.
""You will pay zero income tax in the state of Florida on that $4 million of [NIL] income. In Georgia, you pay 5.3% -- $230,000.""
Meanwhile, a source familiar with negotiations over state NIL bills said there is some hesitation to move forward until Congress weighs in – in hopes of standardizing tax relief for NIL income across the board.

A prominent constituent of Lovvorn’s who spent years as the face of the Tigers’ front office said that federal lawmakers are indeed looking to bring about the clarity and consistency that state officials have asked for.
Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.,who engineered 80 wins in his decade as Auburn’s coach, quipped that the idea of tax-free NIL money makes him want to go back and work his way through the collegiate system again as a player.
""A lot of these kids make a lot of money,"" Tuberville said, adding that while he does not want to interfere with state legislators, he and Senate Commerce Committee chairman Ted Cruz of Texas have been trying to ""make all 50 states the same.""
Tuberville said there should not be an advantage for one state over the other, and that if action is not taken on NIL, ""you’re going to lose a lot of sports and it’s just unfortunate.""
He noted the importance college sports play in training U.S. Olympians, and suggested the issue needs legislative clarity before the games come to Los Angeles in a few years.

Tim Scott, R-S.C., joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the impact of DOGE's spending cuts, arguing President Donald Trump is keeping his campaign promises, and reacts to Sen. Chuck Schumer's, D-N.Y., opposition to the budget resolution.
FIRST ON FOX:A new initiative is tracking government agency spending in comparison to growth, and a conservative fiscal watchdog group has discovered what it deems to be an alarming trend.
According to OpenTheBooks, staff levels at theDepartment of Educationhave decreased since 2000, but the agency's spending grew by 749%. OpenTheBooks says the calculation is ""even more galling"" after recent statistics from the National Assessment of Educational Progress showed that student achievement has still not recovered since it saw big drops during theCOVID-19 pandemic.
These graphs allegedly show numbers from the Department of Education that were uncovered by OpenTheBooks. The department's staff has gone down since 2000, but the agency's spending has increased nearly eightfold.
OpenTheBooks' data on theDepartment of Educationis part of a wider initiative being unveiled by the group on Thursday to chart agency outlays versus agency spending in an effort to provide the public with ""a clearer picture of the government as it stands."" As OpenTheBooks tracked agency spending versus size, it found that federal agency spending has far outpaced the rate at which these agencies have grown over time.
Ina reportannouncing the new initiative, the fiscal watchdog group cited complaints about purported cost-saving efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its leader, tech billionaire Elon Musk, questioning the need for spending cuts in the face of a federal workforce that has largely remained static in terms of size.
In some cases, such as with the Department of Education, the group found as much as a sevenfold increase in spending while staff headcounts remained relatively static or even went down. At the National Institutes of Health, for example, staff levels appreciated by 21.5%, but spending grew 301%.
TRUMP ISSUES WARNING ABOUT WASTEFUL SPENDING, ORDERS ‘RADICAL TRANSPARENCY’ AMID DOGE PROBES, REVELATIONS
Savannah Newhouse, a Department of Education spokesperson, slammed past administrations for ""frivolously spending taxpayer dollars on priorities that do nothing to help our students learn.""
Newhouse cited programs such as ""DEI training in teacher prep programs and 'Equity Assistance Centers'"" at the department, adding that the agency's lack of focus on student outcomes was evidenced by recent data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress.
""Under President Trump, the department is aggressively auditing our spending to ensure maximum impact for students and responsible stewardship of taxpayer dollars,"" she said.
OpenTheBooks found that federal agency spending has far outpaced the rate at which these agencies have grown over time. For example, Department of Education staffing levels have decreased over the last 25 years as spending grew nearly 750%.
In addition to tracking outlays versus agency growth, OpenTheBooks also found that at least 75 federal agencies listed in the Federal Register are effectively ""defunct or obsolete,"" as they have become subsumed by other entities, renamed or in some cases no longer even exist. The group noted that records of these ""defunct"" agencies are frequently out of date, making it hard for the public to ascertain a complete picture of the federal government.
""In manyfederal agencies,spending has outpaced not just inflation but also growing headcounts — often many times over. This begs an important question: Where is the money going?"" OpenTheBooks CEO John Hart said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Taxpayers deserve to see the growth in spending in each agency so they can decide how many we need … If the excessive waste and fraud we've uncovered over the years — and DOGE is highlighting — is any guide, taxpayers may be better served by far fewer than 441 agencies, including the ones that are defunct.""

So far, OpenTheBooks has charted 50 federal agencies as far back as the data goes, and the group has created an accessible database that gives the public ""a clearer picture of the government as it stands."" As the group charts more agencies, it will periodically release their findings.

Other notable examples the fiscal watchdog group highlighted include theFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)and the Agency for International Development (USAID). At FEMA, staffing levels grew roughly 290% over the last quarter-century, but spending ballooned more than seven times faster at a rate of 2,096%. At USAID, staffing levels grew roughly 218%, while spending grew about 468%.",2/20/2025

The Trump administration revised federal acquisition rules this week requiring the government to stop considering diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) when awarding contracts. This change aligns with the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) broader efforts to fundamentally transform federal operations.
The General Services Administration (GSA) on Tuesdayannouncedchanges to the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) that are meant to align with the president's executive order aimed at restoring meritocracy and ending discrimination in the public and private sectors. The move reverses previous Biden administration executive orders that made it mandatory to consider DEI when reviewing contract proposals.
Elon Musk,who has been leading the charge to radically reform the government, praised the move on X, formerly Twitter, in advance of the GSA's formal announcement about the changes. ""Major FAR reform is needed,"" Musk said in a post highlighting GSA acting administrator Stephen Ehikian's announcement about the changes.

""These actions are the first steps in transforming the FAR into a sensible, common sense guideline to ensure that the federal government is working with industry as an attractive partner for business,"" Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.
""Coming from private industry, I know how convoluted working through government regulations that don't make sense can be. We're going to streamline the FAR and make it industry friendly, more efficient, and deliver cost savings and better value.""

Trump'sDay Oneexecutive order, which the GSA is aligning its actions with, directed the federal contracting process to ""be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws."" The order also commanded the Office of Federal Contract Compliance to ""immediately cease"" promoting ""diversity,"" as well as any encouragement of federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in affirmative action-like efforts that consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion or national origin when making hiring decisions.
Trump's order added that the heads of each executive agency must begin including contractual language that requires federal contractors to agree to comply with federal anti-discrimination laws. Meanwhile, language associated withDEI principleswas also ordered to be removed from any federal acquisition, contracting, grant or financial assistance procedures.

""The steps taken by GSA will make it easier for industry to sell their products and services to the government,"" acting administrator Ehikian said Tuesday. ""GSA is leading the way in transforming government and strongly encourages other agencies to follow our lead.""
Trump and fellow Republicans have pushed hard against DEI policies in recent weeks, making the case that the government should instead focus on meritocracy. DOGE claims it has already addressed hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars in DEI-related contract cuts,including $350 millionat the Department of Education last week.

Kelly Loeffler, a prominent business executive and philanthropist who served as a senator from Georgia for two years, will now lead the agency. She unveiled plans during her confirmation hearing to reduce regulatory burdens on small business owners, and enhance access to SBA-backed loans and grants.
The agency aims to provide small business owners with counseling, capital and contracting expertise to advance their businesses.
Loeffler appeared before the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee Jan. 28 to outline her vision and promised that Trump’s policies would ""restore the small business economy"" that would lead to a ""golden era of prosperity and growth.""

""That’s exactly what the America First agenda does — by ending inflation, cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, slashing regulation, and reining in fraud, waste, and abuse across government,"" Loeffler said in her opening remarks.
Loeffler and her husband, Jeff, created a Fortune 500 financial services and technology company together, and she has told lawmakers she intends to donate her annual $207,500 salary as SBA administrator to charity.
Loeffler, whose net worth is estimated at roughly $1 billion, previously donated her annual Senate salary of $174,000 between 2019 and 2021 to more than 40 Georgia charities and nonprofits.
Those organizations included food banks, faith groups and organizations opposed to abortion, foster care/adoption groups as well as organizations promoting health care, agriculture, education, law enforcement and disaster relief.
The Senate voted Thursday by a 51–43 margin to advance Loeffler’s nomination for the final confirmation vote.
Chair of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, backed Loeffler’s nomination, citing Loeffler’s ""zero-tolerance policy for waste, fraud and abuse"" within the agency.

""Senator Loeffler is immensely qualified for this role,"" Ernst said on the Senate floor Thursday. ""As a successful businesswoman, it is abundantly clear that Senator Loeffler truly understands what it takes to be an entrepreneur and will be an effective voice for small businesses across America.""
However, ranking member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass, pushed back on Loeffler’s nomination amid concern that her confirmation would pave the way for the newly created Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to ""illegally cut off funding"" for small business owners. As a result, he said that Trump is looking to fill his cabinet with those that will follow his ""illegal bidding.""
Markey and Loeffler also sparred during her confirmation hearing in January after the Trump administration announced Jan. 27 that it would freeze federal funds and grants that aimed to eradicate ""wokeness"" and the ""weaponization of government.""

While the White House rescinded the memo on Jan. 29, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the federal funding freeze remained in effect.
As a result, Markey pressed Loeffler on whether she believed the move was lawful or not, following backlash from members of Congress that the Trump administration attempted to illegally circumvent Congress and withhold funds.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/green-new-headache-dems-flee-govs-green-energy-master-plan-election-approaches,Green New Headache: Dems flee gov’s green ‘Energy Master Plan’ as election approaches,"New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy says mysterious drones being sighted over his state are 'very sophisticated,' as FBI, Secret Service investigate the issue.
A prominent New Jersey Democrat running for governor this year publicly split from leftist Gov. Phil Murphy’s green ""Energy Master Plan"" as Garden State residents brace for 20% or worse increases in utility costs by summertime.
Formerstate Senate President Steve Sweeneycalled for an immediate halt to Murphy’s comprehensive roadmap to 100% clean energy by 2050, saying his ""foremost priority"" if elected is to make the notoriously pricy state an affordable place to live.
""The recent increases in utility bills demonstrate how overly ambitious targets for a zero-carbon future can negatively impact our residents. We need to take a step back and reassess policies that could drive costs even higher,"" Sweeneysaid on NJ-101.5FM.
Rate hikes of 17-21% can be expected throughout the state, via Jersey Central Power & Light, Atlantic City Electric, PSEG and New York-based Rockland Electric, according to 101.5.
NJ RESIDENTS HIT WITH DOUBLED UTILITY BILLS AS LAWMAKERS FUME OVER MURPHY'S ‘ENERGY DISASTER PLAN’
In a further statement, Sweeney noted he previously sponsored legislation on solar power development, offshore windmills and reducing New Jersey’s reliance on fossil fuels. He also has encouraged building up the state’s EV infrastructure and promoting EV sales.
But, the Democrat appeared to split with some on his side of the aisle by expressing an openness to pursue natural gas as a cleaner fuel source than oil.
""With our abundant organic resources – from landfills and sewage to farms and food waste – New Jersey has a unique opportunity to harness [natural gas] to generate gas to meet our energy needs,"" Sweeney said.
""We must also acknowledge and make effective use of the substantial investments that have been made in our pipeline infrastructure, which represents a commitment that should not be disregarded.""
Meanwhile, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, R-Scotch Plains, told Fox News Digital on Wednesday that Sweeney’s public stance shows the left’s green energy plans are ""too extreme, even for Democrats.""
GOP LAWMAKER TORCHES OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS AS MAYOR WARNS OF 'STAR WARS' BACKDROPS
The term-limited Murphy’s plan ""wasn’t practical,"" said Bramnick, a top candidate on the GOP side to replace him.
""Sometimes, Democrats become more political than practical – and that's kind of why they’re having more trouble at the polls.""
""I think their heart might be in the right place, but they lack some practical common sense,"" Bramnick said.
In a prior interview on Trenton's green energy efforts, lawmakers such as state Sen. Mike Testa, R-Vineland, derided the idea as the ""Energy Disaster Plan.""

""Quite frankly, what I think happened is, via the Murphy Energy Master Plan that I've often called the energy disaster plan, it seemed that the BPU (New Jersey Board of Public Utilities) and the Murphy administration are working in tandem chasing this green energy dream…. It's a green energy nightmare,"" Testa said at the time.
For his part, Murphy has defended his plan, saying it ""comprehensively addresses New Jersey’s energy system, including electricity generation, transportation and buildings, and their associated greenhouse gas emissions and related air pollutants.""
Fox News Digital also reached out to prominent Democratic candidate Steve Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, and RepublicanEdward Durr, better known in New Jersey as ""Ed the Trucker.""
In Janurary, Fulop released a dozen-page outline of his ""environmental and sustainability policy goals,"" and has touted Jersey City's advancements in energy and sustainability endeavors.
Durr, who was then a newcomerto politics, notably engineered the 2021 upset win against Sweeney in Gloucester County that drew national attention.

FormerRep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, a pro-union Republican, will go before the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) on Wednesday for a confirmation hearing to be the next Secretary of Labor.
PresidentDonald Trump'schoice to lead the Department of Labor will be questioned by committee senators beginning at 10 a.m.
Chavez-DeRemer has already found an opponent inSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who is a member of HELP.
""Her support for the PRO Act, which would not only oppose national right to work, but it would preempt state law on right to work,"" he previously told reporters. ""I think it's not a good thing, and it'd be sort of hard for me since it's a big issue for me to support her. So I won't support her.""
MCCONNELL'S MENTAL ACUITY TARGETED BY TRUMP AFTER EX-SENATE LEADER JOINS DEMS AGAINST CABINET NOMINEES
Lori Chavez-DeRemer will go before the Senate HELP committee on Wednesday for a confirmation hearing, while Sen. Rand Paul has said he will vote ‘no.’(Reuters)
The Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act) is a piece of legislation designed to protect union workers and was introduced in Congress several years ago. It would effectively kill state-level laws that prohibit employers and unions from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of their employment. Republicans have traditionally supported such Right-to-Work laws, and many have opposed the PRO Act for that reason.
As of the night before the confirmation hearing, Paul was still planning to oppose Trump's pick. ""If she wanted to make a public statement saying that her support for the PRO Act was incorrect and she no longer does, then I'd think about her nomination,"" he told Fox News Digital in a statement.
Fox News Digital asked a representative for Chavez-DeRemer whether her support for the bill had changed but did not receive a response.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., foreshadowed the questions Chavez-DeRemer would face while speaking with reporters recently.

Thune previewed some of the senators' concerns.(Reuters)
""[S]upport for the PRO Act is not something that most Republicans have tolerated in the past, but I think she's attempted to address that, and my hope is that she can further clarify her position on some of those issues when she goes through the hearing process,"" Thune said.
If Paul chooses to vote ""no"" or abstain from voting at the committee level, Chavez-DeRemer's nomination could fail to get a majority of ""yes"" votes or end up tied. However, it could still be reported and scheduled for a floor vote, without a favorable recommendation from the committee. In this case, she would need to amass 60 votes in the full Senate to move on to confirmation.

Following his election in November, Trump announced Chavez-DeRemer as his choice to lead the Labor Department.
""Lori has worked tirelessly with both Business and Labor to build America’s workforce, and support the hardworking men and women of America,"" he said in a statement at the time. ""I look forward to working with her to create tremendous opportunity for American Workers, to expand Training and Apprenticeships, to grow wages and improve working conditions, to bring back our Manufacturing jobs. Together, we will achieve historic cooperation between Business and Labor that will restore the American Dream for Working Families.""

Hochul orders National Guard to staff correction facilities amid unsanctioned strikes, staff shortages","The governor makes an announcement about public safety after a heavily armed man is arrested in Queens.
New YorkGov. Kathy Hochulannounced on Tuesday preparations to use the New York National Guard to protect correction officers who are currently on the job, inmates, and the communities surrounding the correctional facilities.
The move comes after inmates took over three dorms and attacked three guards at Collins Correctional Facility inErie County, amid reports of staffing shortages.
Over the last year, dozens of guards at the facility have been injured by inmates, Fox News Digital previously reported.

""The illegal and unlawful actions being taken by a number of correction officers must end immediately,"" Gov. Hochul wrote in the statement. ""We will not allow these individuals to jeopardize the safety of their colleagues, incarcerated people, and the residents of communities surrounding our correctional facilities.""

In March 2024, the union agreed to a collective bargaining agreement with the State of New York to improve working conditions for corrections officers.
Some of the benefits included: increased salaries and starting pay for new employees by $6,500, increased correction officer location-based pay by $500 to $1,000 per officer for downstate assignments, increased correction officer hazardous duty pay from $200 to $1,075, and providing 12 weeks of fully-paid parental leave.
Laws and administrative changes have been made to protect corrections officers, and recruitment efforts have been expanded.
The NYSCOPBA did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Mike Haridopolos, R-Fla., on Democrats fighting to obstruct DOGE's efforts, holding government accountable and the need for transparency.
EXCLUSIVE:In commemoration of Presidents Day, a top DOGE senator is seeking to claw back $400 million sitting in a ""slush fund"" set up to help presidential candidates that hasn’t borne fruit since Y2K.
Through the Eliminating Leftover Expenses for Campaigns from Taxpayers (ELECT) Act,Sen. Joni Ernstsaid she hopes to defund an account she calls ""welfare for politicians.""
""This Presidents Day I am fighting for the integrity of the office because the last thing we need to spend tax dollars on is more political attack ads,""said Ernst, R-Iowa.
""There is no better way to pay down the $36 trillion debt than by defunding welfare for politicians. Washington should be working to benefit all Americans instead of itself.""
DRAIN THE SWAMP ACT SEEKS TO MOVE DC BUREAUCRACY OUT OF CRAZYTOWN, DOGE LEADER SAYS
Ernst, the chair of theDOGE caucusin the upper chamber, remarked the fund has not been successfully utilized in decades.
The last winning presidential candidate to pull from the fund was Texas Gov. George W. Bush in 2000, and later in 2004.
Since then, a handful of unsuccessful candidates have utilized it, including former Vice President Mike Pence and Green Party candidate Jill Stein; both in the 2024 cycle.
Pence’s campaign reportedly received more than $1 million from the fund amid his GOP primary bid, while Stein utilized $380,000.
The late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also received $84.1 million from the fund in 2008. An FEC release from that time said nominees of major parties are entitled to $20 million plus a cost-of-living adjustment back to 1974.
Defunding the account was first floated as one of several proposals in a DOGE-centric November letter from Ernst to Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy.
Stein told Fox News Digital the candidates' fund was ""raided"" of $375 million, and that Democrats too have tried to moot the effectiveness of the fund by trying to put public funding ""out of reach of grassroots candidates"" through their H.R.-1 (the For the People Act) during the Biden era.

A checkbox on the IRS' 1040 tax form asks filers whether they would like to pay $3 into the fund, which Stein said showed it is different than other public monies.
""It's outrageous,"" Stein said, calling the effort to end the fund ""part of a bipartisan, anti-democratic effort to stifle competition in presidential elections – specifically by denying voters the option to support publicly financed candidates who refuse the legalized bribery of big corporate contributions.""
Stein added that a majority of voters have called for presidential candidates outside the two major parties, citing a Gallup survey showing they ""do such a poor job"" of representing Americans.
""Publicly funded campaigns are the antidote to the massive legalized corruption that puts more money in the hands of billionaires than ever… the American people abhor the corporate buyout of our elections,"" Stein said.
""As life becomes increasingly unlivable for everyday Americans, while billionaire wealth skyrockets, the demand to end the sale of our democracy will be unstoppable, through simple reforms including publicly funded elections, inclusive debates, ranked choice voting, ending obstructive ballot access laws and voter suppression, and more.""
""Eliminating public funding denies voters the option to support candidates who refuse pay-to-play politics.""
A source familiar said FEC rules also allow candidates to continue seeking public funds for campaign debt.
IRS Code 9006, with footnotes dating the fund to at least the 1970s, allows for eligible candidates to be paid out of the fund ""upon receipt of a certification from the [Federal Election] Commission.""
""Amounts paid to any such candidates shall be under the control of such candidates.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-tariffs-spark-exciting-time-ohio-steel-plant-ceo-eyes-adding-jobs-boosting-productivity,"Trump tariffs spark 'exciting time' for Ohio steel plant as CEO eyes adding jobs, boosting productivity","Fox News senior White House correspondent Jacqui Heinrich joins ‘Special Report’ to discuss President Donald Trump’s announcement of reciprocal tariffs on trading partners.
FIRST ON FOX:President Donald Trump’stariffs will be a boon for an Ohio-based steel mill and its employees, the CEO of JSW Steel USA, a subsidiary of a massive India-based steel manufacturer, told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview.
""It's a good piece of the formula that results in our company increasing utilization in the next 12 months, from 68% to probably 84%, and beyond that in years to come. So it's a very exciting time for us,"" JSW Steel USA CEO Robert Simon told Fox News Digital of Trump’s tariff plan in a phone interview on Thursday evening.
Simon has served as the CEO of JSW Steel USA since March of last year, bringing with him more than 30 years ofexperience in the steel industry. He spoke to Fox News Digital following Trump announcing his administration’s ""fair and reciprocal plan on trade,"" which he celebrated during a press conference as a project that will flood the U.S. with jobs as trading partners move their industries to U.S. soil to avoid tariffs.
JSW USA is a subsidiary of Mumbai-headquartered JSW Group, which owns India’s second-largest private steel company, JSW Steel. JSW USA has two steel locations in the U.S., one at Mingo Junction, Ohio, and another operation in Baytown, Texas.

JSW Steel USA CEO Robert Simon spoke with Fox Digital in an exclusive interview.(JSW Steel USA )
Simon told Fox News Digital that across his more than 30 years in the industry, U.S.steel manufacturershave complied with strict environmental and safety practices, and paid their employees fairly, while foreign steel manufacturers could skirt U.S. regulations while exporting their goods to the U.S.
""We, as steel producers, we paid our employees fair wages, treated them fairly, met some of the most – if not the most strict – environmental requirements in the world, and those practices in our markets, with the simple supply-demand equation establishes market pricing.""
The JSW Steel USA facility in Mingo Junction, Ohio.(JSW Steel USA )
""The frustration is, how is it fair that others that don't treat their employees the same way, don't follow the same rules, don't follow environmental practices… they get government subsidies. How is it fair that they can come into our markets and take market share when it's not an equal playing field?"" he said.
Simon said the Ohio plant alone will likely see a minimum increase of 100 jobs in the next year under Trump’s tariff plan.
""As you look at that increase in utilization coupled with the overall increase in production that we foresee in the next three to five years, we estimate, at a minimum, a 100 jobs increase in the next 12 plus months associated with that utilization rate increase,"" he said.
WHO GETS HIT HARDEST BY STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS?
Trump's administration issued a fact sheetlast week restoring a 25% tariff on steel, which detailed ""domestic steel and aluminum industries and achieving sustainable capacity utilization of at least 80%."" JSW Steel USA told Fox News Digital that they are already on track to increase their utilization rate from 68% to 84% – higher than Trump’s target number of 80%.
Under the first Trump administration, JSW Steel USA notably sued the federal government in 2019 over tariffs regarding imported steel-slab materials. The company now makes all domestic steel-slab materials as part of the JSW Group’s belief that its facilities both make products and supply the product in the communities they serve.

Simon celebrated in his comments to Fox Digital that Ohio families that had long worked in the steel industry are making a return to the factory as the industry reinvigorates under the first and second Trump administrations. JSW USA purchased the Ohio factory in 2018, after it had operated as a Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel plant, but sat dormant for years.

""This is a company that had been shut down for over seven years, when we acquired it. We hired a workforce, trained a workforce, all from the local area. What's really cool to see is we've got employees whose grandparents and great-grandparentsworked in this same company, which ended up being shut down, and they're part now of reviving that company and bringing it to an offering of products that's extremely competitive and extremely impressive in terms of its value added products,"" Simon said.
Trump announced a reciprocal tariff plan on Thursday, tapping Howard Lutnick, his nominee for commerce secretary, to produce a report on reciprocal trade relations within 180 days. Lutnik said Thursday that he will have the report ready for Trump by April 1.

WHAT ARE TARIFFS, HOW DO THEY WORK AND WHO PAYS FOR THEM?
​​""On trade, I have decided for purposes of fairness, that I will charge a reciprocal tariff – meaning whatever countries charge the United States of America, we will charge them no more, no less. In other words, they charge us a tax or tariff and we charge them the exact same tax or tariff. Very simple,"" he said at theWhite Houseon Thursday.
Trump touted that the plan will lead to a job boon in the U.S. as foreign trading partners move operations stateside to avoid the reciprocal tariffs.
""They can build a factory here, a plant or whatever it may be, here,"" Trump said Thursday afternoon from the Oval Office. ""And that includes the medical, that includes cars, that includes chips and semiconductors. That includes everything. If you build here, you have no tariffs whatsoever. And I think that's what's going to happen. I think our country is going to beflooded with jobs.""
Simon told Fox News Digital that Trump's business and deal-making abilities are ""obvious to everybody"" as he whips through dozens of executive actions and orders in just a few weeks back in the Oval Office, remarking that it's ""pretty amazing.""
""It's become obvious to everybody that Mr. Trump is not a politician, right, but, more of a business person stepping in and leading our country, from much more of a business perspective than as a career politician. Like it or not, for those folks that have different opinions, this results in very quick negotiations. I don't think I've ever in my time here seen so much movement, so much decision-making, so many decisions being made in this shorter period of time since he's been in office. It's pretty, pretty amazing,"" he said.

""The steel tariffs enacted by President Trump are a necessary step in leveling the playing field for American steelworkers and manufacturers.

Voters responded to Trump discussing his plan to make the government more efficient and cut taxes for families while at theWorld Economic Forumin Davos on Jan. 23.
""I have promised to eliminate ten old regulations for every new regulation which will soon put many thousands of dollars back in the pockets of American families to further unleash our economy,"" Trump said.
""Our majorities in the House and Senate, which we also took along with the presidency — we are going to pass the largest tax cut in American history, including massive tax cuts for workers and family and big tax cuts for domestic producers and manufacturers.

Independents and Republicans were on board with Trump's plan to save taxpayers money. Democrats slightly disapproved at the start of Trump's comments before their reaction remained steady, the Fox News Dial shows.

TheInternal Revenue Service(IRS) is reportedly cutting thousands of probationary workers as tax season ramps up, according to The Associated Press.
The announcement comes just days after the Trump administration instructed agencies to fire most probationary workers who have not secured civil service protection.
The layoffs could potentially impact hundreds of thousands of people, although the exact number has not yet been confirmed, the AP reported.
The Associated Press reported thousands of IRS employees will be fired.

In addition to the probationary cuts, PresidentDonald Trumpannounced on Jan. 29 that federal employees would be fired if they did not return to in-person work by early February.
A buyout offer, which has been extended, has already been accepted by about 65,000 employees.
The Associated Press reported IRS employees involved in the 2025 tax season, which began on Jan. 27, are not eligible for the buyout until after the taxpayer filing deadline, according to a letter sent recently to IRS employees.

President Donald Trumpwrote a lengthy Truth Social post about his trade policy overhaul on Saturday, emphasizing his plans to charge reciprocal tariffs to countries that the U.S. does business with.
In a post published Saturday afternoon, Trump explained how his reciprocal tariffs will work in a great amount of detail. In recent weeks, he has announced 25% tariffs on all aluminum and steel imports into the U.S., plus25% tariffson imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China.
His recent move to implement reciprocal tariffs was decided ""for purposes of Fairness,"" Trump wrote.
""For purposes of this United States Policy, we will consider Countries that use the VAT [value-added tax] System, which is far more punitive than a Tariff, to be similar to that of a Tariff,"" Trump wrote. ""Sending merchandise, product, or anything by any other name through another Country, for purposes of unfairly harming America, will not be accepted.""

""Likewise, provisions will be made for Nonmonetary Tariffs and Trade Barriers that some Countries charge in order to keep our product out of their domain or, if they do not even let U.S. businesses operate,"" the president added. ""We are able to accurately determine the cost of these Nonmonetary Trade Barriers.""
""It is fair to all, no other Country can complain and, in some cases, if a Country feels that the United States would be getting too high a Tariff, all they have to do is reduce or terminate their Tariff against us.

Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., discusses the importance of getting the budget deal done, his reaction to a judge extending the buyout deadline for federal workers and concerns about a Chinese-linked company's billion-dollar E-ZPass contract.
Be careful if you sell online. TheInternal Revenue Servicemay know a lot more about your side hustle this tax season. And the agency is cracking down on those who fail to report the added income.
Anyone who earned more than $5,000 in 2024 selling tickets, musical instruments or other goods and services online should expect to get a 1099-K tax form this month.
Online platforms such as StubHub, Etsy and eBay previously only had to send these forms to users who earned more than $20,000 in most cases. Beginning Jan. 1, 2024, payment platforms such as PayPal, Square and Venmo must report payments totaling $5,000 or more in a calendar year, with no transaction minimum. The 1099-K threshold will drop to $2,500 in 2025 and finally $600 in 2026 unless theIRS makes more changes.
The Internal Revenue Service is cracking down on those who fail to report their added income.(Kurt ""CyberGuy"" Knutsson)
It’s time you get your financial house in order this tax season. The lowered threshold means forms will be sent to millions more taxpayers to make sure they account for the income on their tax returns.
10 HUGE WAYS TO MAKE AMERICA’S ECONOMY GREAT AGAIN IN 2025
""The IRS wants to get the message out that they’re enforcing the laws around people who have a part time business on eBay, Etsy, or reselling tickets on Ticketmaster,"" said Lee Heisman, a partner at Exit Wealth Advisors in Atlanta.
The threshold was supposed to be dropped to $600 in 2021 afterCongress passed changesto ensure taxes get paid on income from gig work and selling concert tickets or other things online.
When online platforms complained about the extra record-keeping this required and the confusion it caused, the rules were delayed. Instead, the IRS chose to phase in the change, setting the $5,000 threshold for the 2024 tax year, $2,500 for 2025 and $600 for 2026.
Even without the forms, taxpayers were already required to report their income on returns, but many never did. In general, people tend to underreport income when no forms are sent to them. This has been my experience over the past 30 years of giving financial advice. Almost no one lies about their salary income, on the other hand, since the details are reported on Form W-2.
TRUMPONOMICS WILL TAME INFLATION – NOT MAKE IT WORSE
So, this may be thefirst tax seasonwhere if you sold candles and soap online, resold some of your sports memorabilia, or put half of your season tickets up for resale that you may have an additional tax bill.
The IRS has generally had questions for those who never report their online income, and those people who don’t report may face steep penalties. The IRS has launched an investigation into taxpayers who earned money as experts on the online platform and allegedly failed to accurately report income from 2017 through 2020.
As an example, Just Answer experts such as veterinarians and mechanics were generally paid between $15 and $25 for each question they responded to. A judge in December authorized the IRS to issue a summons requiring Just Answer to provide the names of anyone who earned $5,000 or more on the platform in any one year in that time period, when the company apparently wasn’t sending out 1099 forms.
One taxpayer audited in 2020had more than $400,000 of unreported income for four years of answering questions, according to an IRS agent’s declaration. As part of the investigation, the agent identified four Just Answer users who appear to have failed to report their Just Answer compensation on their tax returns. One is suspected of having unreported income of more than $1.3 million earned from answering over 86,000 questions.

Whether you get a 1099-K or not, when you start to generate revenue, you should consider this a business. This is true even if you only sell $2,500 of products or tickets on one of the online selling marketplaces.
In my view, it’s always a best practice to have a separation of church and state. Meaning that you should set up an official LLC or plan to file a Schedule C, set up a separate credit card, and a set up a separate bank account. This way, you can make a demarcation line from your business of selling items online away from the day to day of your personal finances.
In general, if your business claims a net loss for too many years (three out of five) or fails to meet other requirements deemed by the IRS then it may be classified as a hobby.If the IRS deemsthat it is a hobby, then all your business deductions could be disallowed.

Being ignorant around the changes in the tax law and telling the IRS you didn’t know isn’t going to be an appropriate defense if you get audited. If you make any money at all trading collectibles, selling tickets, or living out your side hustle on Etsy, it’s important you understand these rules changes for 2024 and the upcoming years in 2025, 2026, and beyond.
Hopefully theIRS will never audit you, but if they do you can prepare to have your ""tax"" ducks all lined up and ready to go!

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/costco-investors-could-pay-big-time-its-dei-policies,Costco and investors could pay big time for its DEI policies,"Americans from Texas, Michigan and New York react to Costco's refusal to adhere to President Trump's private sector suggestion to band DEI hiring policies.
By now, many companies have learned the hard way that Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs aren’t the business panacea they were once sold to be. In recent weeks, Google, Amazon, Walmart, Ford, McDonald’s and many other major corporations, facing backlash and declining employee morale, have backtracked from DEI, shifting gears in the face of mounting legal and financial risks.But Costco, against the tide,has doubled down on its DEI initiatives — at the peril of its bottom line, and now, its legal standing.
Costco’s DEI programisn’t just a set of lofty ideals. It is embedded in the company’s operations at every level, with a Chief Diversity Officer at the helm and employees dedicated solely to diversity goals. This program informs hiring decisions, with race and gender as key factors in determining who is hired.
Moreover, the company favors racial minorities and women-owned businesses when selecting suppliers, and its donations go to controversial activist groups — some of which have been accused of illegal racial discrimination themselves.
FORMER COSTCO EXECUTIVE DEFENDS ITS DEI POLICIES, SAYS CRITICS DON'T UNDERSTAND THE COMPANY'S CULTURE
In a bid to halt Costco’s DEI trajectory, a shareholder proposal was recently brought forward, urging the company to evaluate the risks associated with its diversity policies. This proposal pointed to the legal case of Starbucks, which was forced to pay a $25 million verdict for a single instance of discrimination against a White employee. While that case involved only one individual, thefinancial fallout for Costcocould be catastrophic.
While many companies move away from DEI, Costco continues to stick to its outmoded strategy. FILE: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a Costco store on July 11, 2024, in Richmond, California.(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
If even a small fraction of Costco’s up to 200,000 non-minority employees decided to sue, the company could face judgments running into tens of billions of dollars. But when confronted with this data, Costco didn’t retreat; instead, the company’s board rejected the proposal and defended its DEI program. The company claimed that its focus on diversity wasn’t just about improving financial outcomes, but about ""enhancing our culture and the well-being of people whose lives we influence.""
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Despite the risks outlined, the three biggest asset managers — BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street — were complicit with the board in driving Costco’s DEI push. With significant stakes in the company, these investment giants control nearly a fifth of Costco’s shares. Their votes likely provided the critical mass necessary for the proposal’s overwhelming passage. BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street have continued to champion DEI, even as its legal implications grow clearer.
Costco’s blind commitment to DEI is now drawing the attention of legal authorities at the highest levels. In late January, President Donald Trump issued an executive order directing federal agencies to scrutinize companies that maintain illegal discriminatory practices, including DEI initiatives. Each agency is tasked with identifying companies — such as Costco — that may be violating federal laws prohibiting discrimination.
On top of this, a coalition of 19 state attorneys general has stepped up, urging Costco to reevaluate its DEI policies. They argue that Costco’s programs may be in violation of anti-discrimination laws, and the company has just 30 days to comply with their demands or face further legal action.
Costco’s decision to dig in its heels on DEI is a bold one and could prove to be disastrous. The mounting legal challenges and the ever-growing body of evidence showing that DEI programs increase workplace hostility and fail to yield the promised business benefits should give pause to anyone still holding out hope for their success.

As more states and federal agencies take a closer look at the legal ramifications of DEI policies, companies like Costco may soon find themselves on the wrong side of the law, facing penalties that far outweigh any short-term cultural benefits. For investors, this should be a wake-up call. Costco’s stock has tripled over the past five years and is sitting at an all-time high. Pushing for divisive, race-based policies could alienate customers and increase legal exposure, impacting the share price.
The tide is turning for most firms. Companies across America are waking up to the dangers of DEI. Disney, Target and Anheuser-Busch all saw their stocks plummet after DEI controversies and are trying to make amends. Costco might be next to learn that diversity at the expense of the law and customer preference is a bet that doesn’t pay off.

Trump's order authorized tariffs through the new International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Itincluded 25% tariffson imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China. Energy resources from Canada would have a lower 10% tariff.

Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., discusses the importance of getting the budget deal done, his reaction to a judge extending the buyout deadline for federal workers and concerns about a Chinese-linked company's billion-dollar E-ZPass contract.
FIRST ON FOX:Republican lawmakers are mounting a massive effort to repeal the federal inheritance tax, colloquially known as the ""death tax.""
Rep. Randy Feenstra, R-Iowa, is leading more than 170 House Republicans on the ""Death Tax Repeal Act,"" which is also backed by the House’s top tax writer, Ways & Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo.
An inheritance or estate tax is levied upon the beneficiary who receives assets upon a person's death. Republicans have long criticized the estate tax as a needless financial burden on grieving families, particularly hitting small family-owned businesses.
It comes as Republicanswork on extendingPresident Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, whose provisions expire at the end of this year. Among the measures sunsetting in 2026 is a doubling of the estate tax exemption.

Supporters of the federal estate tax point out that it affects a relatively small number of estates. Penalties are triggered for estates worth roughly $13.9 million at the time of death, according to the latest IRS data.
A counterpart bill in the Senate is being led by Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and is backed by 44 senators.
Both Feenstra and Thune argued it was an unnecessary tax that unfairly affected family farms and small businesses in their home states of Iowa, South Dakota and elsewhere.

""The death tax is an egregious double tax that unfairly targets American family farms and small businesses and directly threatens long-held farming traditions in rural Iowa and across the country,"" Feenstra told Fox News Digital. ""It is ridiculous that the federal government sends grieving families a massive tax bill when a loved one passes away.""
He said it amounted to ""double taxation.""
""Family farms and ranches play a vital role in our economy and are the lifeblood of rural communities inSouth Dakota,"" Thune told Fox News Digital.
""Losing even one of them to the death tax is one too many. It’s time to put an end to this punishing, burdensome tax once and for all so that family farms, ranches and small businesses can grow and thrive without costly estate planning or massive tax burdens that can threaten their viability.""

If Republicans fail to extend Trump’s tax cuts before the end of this year, the estate tax would affect any estates worth roughly $7 million or more, according toModern Wealth Law.
House Ways & Means Committee Republicans shared a memo late last year that said everyday American households could see taxes rise by over 20% if the tax cuts expired.
Feenstra and Thune’s bill would abolish the tax altogether, however.

Financial advisor Eugene Ludwig said voters were right andDemocrats were wrongabout the state of the economy leading up to the election in an article Tuesday.
""Before the presidential election, many Democrats were puzzled by the seeming disconnect between ‘economic reality’ as reflected in various government statistics and the public’s perceptions of the economy on the ground,"" Ludwig wrote in aPoliticopiece titled, ""Voters Were Right About the Economy. The Data Was Wrong.""
""Many in Washington bristled at the public’s failure to register how strong the economy really was. They charged that right-wing echo chambers were conning voters into believing entirely preposterous narratives about America’s decline,"" he said.
""What they rarely considered was whether something else might be responsible for the disconnect — whether, for instance, government statistics were fundamentally flawed.""
POLITICO CLAIMS SLOWER WAGE GROWTH COULD BE 'A GOOD THING FOR WORKERS'
Ludwig previously served as the former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency under President Bill Clinton, part of an independent bureau in the Department of the Treasury.
Eugene Ludwig criticized Democrats touting a great economy during the Biden administration despite voter pessimism.(REUTERS/Elizabeth Frantz)
After his move to the private sector, he became ""increasingly skeptical that the government’s measurements properly capture the realities defining unemployment, wage growth and the strength of the economy as a whole.""
Through research under his organization, the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity, he found ""for 20 years or more,including the months prior to the election,voter perception was more reflective of reality than the incumbent statistics.""
""Democrats, on the whole, seemed much more inclined to believe what the economic indicators reported. Republicans, by contrast, seemed more inclined to believe what they were seeing with their own two eyes,"" Ludwig observed.
Though Ludwig called the agency employees providing these statistics ""talented and well-intentioned,"" he said the filters they used were ""flawed"" and the resulting calculations were ""misleading.""
In one example, he saidreports on unemploymentoften count people ""unwillingly under-employed"" as employed and disregard Americans ""discouraged"" enough to stop looking for a job.
""[T]he prevailing statistic does not account for the meagerness of any individual’s income,"" he added. ""Thus you could be homeless on the streets, making an intermittent income and functionally incapable of keeping your family fed, and the government would still count you as ‘employed.'""
Ludwig wrote that voter perception of the economy tends to be more accurate than government statistics.(i-stock)
Ludwig also took aim at the claims by Democrats thatinflation had cooledfrom its record highs and that wages had risen at a faster rate.
He wrote how this was usually based on numbers from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) which tracks the prices of 80,000 goods and services across the economy. However, he warned that most modest-income Americans spend more on basic amenities like groceries and rent rather than the goods from the CPI, painting a vastly different picture.
""If prices for eggs, insurance premiums and studio apartment leases rise at a faster clip than those of luxury goods and second homes, the CPI underestimates the impact of inflation on the bulk of Americans. That, of course, is exactly what has happened,"" Ludwig said.
He implored both Republicans and Democrats alike to take a more accurate view of the economy and government statistics.
""[I]f the prevailing indicators remain misleading, the facts don’t apply,"" he concluded. ""We have it in our grasp to cut through the mirage that led Democrats astray in 2024. The question now is whether we will correct course.""

Stargate, the massiveartificial intelligence (AI)infrastructure project recently unveiled by President Donald Trump, has begun production in Texas — with data center construction in other states expected to be announced in the coming months.
OpenAI, Softbank, Oracle and other partners' total investment of $500 million in the project will produce a large-scale network of campuses. Each campus will be designed in the roughly 1 gigawatt (GW) or greater range, a measurement of electricity that can power a minimum of 750,000 homes.
During a recent press briefing onThe Stargate Projectattended byFox News Digital, OpenAI announced that construction on the first site is underway in Abilene, Texas. Significant progress has been made in identifying additional locations. Stargate is currently weighing 16 additional states as options for future sites.

Lehane also said OpenAI has been ""blown away"" by how Texas is thinking about AI, calling it a state that is ""certainly thinking big, acting big and looking to build big.""
Stargate's short-term rollout is as follows, according to Lehane, OpenAI Chief Economist Ronnie Chatterji, and Keith Heyde, the company's director of Infrastructure Strategy and Deployment.
Stargate has also revealed a 3-phase site selection process. This will include evaluating potential sites for critical criteria, including power, size, water, people, and fiber.

OpenAI estimates that each 1 GW supercomputer campus will generate thousands of jobs through direct, indirect and induced effects.
Direct effects are those employed directly by campuses in construction and operation roles. Indirect effects are how the initial industry's spending circulates within the local economy, while induced effects are how wages earned within the affected industries contribute to consumer spending in the region.
OpenAI has said that ensuring the world's most advanced AI supercomputers remain U.S.-based is crucial tomaintaining a competitive advantageover the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/impending-ai-driven-jobless-economy-who-will-pay-taxes,The impending AI-driven jobless economy: Who will pay taxes?,"Vice President JD Vance addressed the AI Action Summit in Paris Tuesday during his first foreign trip since taking office. (AP)
Our socioeconomic system is facing anexistential threat from AI. In our capitalist society, most people depend on jobs to sustain themselves. The U.S. government, in turn, relies heavily on taxing the income of individual workers for revenue.
Asartificial intelligence progressively eliminatesjob opportunities, a growing number of individuals will face severe job insecurity, leading to a corresponding decline in federal revenue. Radical action is needed now to steer away from a dystopian collapse toward better possibilities.
Specifically, income-based taxes must be replaced with some other form of taxation, and the support mechanisms for the unemployed must be adapted to support a large population that will have been pushed out of the job market. Given that the use of AI in place of human workers is the cause of the problem, it makes sense that the commercial use of AI systems should be taxed to compensate Americans for lost wages and the federal government for the loss of income-based taxes.
The revenue collected by the U.S. government is currently based on taxing working humans.
The motivation for these concerns is thatAI capabilities are advancing rapidly, and while most jobs are currently safe, it is becoming clear that AI will eventually perform nearly any task more efficiently and cheaply than people can. From manufacturing to customer service and even creative fields like writing or music, machines are already showing that they can outperform humans.
AI CAN’T WAIT: WHY WE NEED SPEED TO WIN
The wide range of robots under development will extend AI's reach to include physical jobs, such as construction, healthcare and house cleaning. Although this transition won’t occur overnight, it is inevitable. Companies will continue replacing human workers with AI-driven systems because it saves money and boosts productivity. The question isn’t if AI will take over most jobs, it’s when.
A future where robots do all the work could be great if we plan now for the societal implications of widespread unemployment. The obvious problem is that without jobs, people will have no way to pay for food, housing or anything else. The slightly less obvious problem is that the revenue collected by the U.S. government is currently based on taxing working humans.
Adding up payroll, income,Social Security and Medicare taxestogether accounts for more than 80% of federal revenue. As unemployment grows, the tax base will diminish, resulting in a substantial decline in government revenue. Our economy will face a double whammy of falling revenue while at the same time growing numbers of people who genuinely and through no fault of their own need support.
AI IS RESHAPING BUSINESS. THIS IS HOW WE STAY AHEAD OF CHINA
Traditionally, the issue of supporting non-workers, for example, through Welfare or Universal Basic Income (UBI), has been objectionable to many because it fundamentally involves taxing the production of workers to support those who don’t work. That type of wealth reallocation evokes alienating comparisons to socialism or communism. Even if we were willing to accept the idea of taxing workers and using the money to support others, that requires a large pool of workers to tax, which we won't have because AI will have taken their jobs.
However, withAI replacing human workers, we have an alternative method for funding support mechanisms like UBI. What we need to do is figure out a reasonable way to tax the work done by AI and distribute the proceeds rationally to human beings.
This proposal is very different from socialism or communism in that we aren't taking the fruits of one person's work and giving them to someone else. Instead, we would be taking the proceeds of AI/robot effort and sharing them out to humans.
HOW TEAM TRUMP CAN MAKE AI STAND FOR AMERICAN INNOVATION
Given that AI systems have been trained on vast amounts of the public's data, there is even a compelling economic justification for taxing these AI systems and sending money back to the public. Think of it as a license fee paid to American citizens for using their data.
Of course, many Americans also object to taxing businesses. FromAmazon to mom-and-pop groceries, the concern is that taxes would be burdensome and harmful to the business.
However, these companies will see huge savings from replacing workers that might cost $30K to $300K per year in salary with robots that could easily cost less than $30K and have annual maintenance and power costs well under $20K per year. The savings for non-physical jobs will be even larger as those won't require a physical robot, just an AI running in the cloud.

As an added bonus, these AI workers operate 24/7 without needing rest. (Note that the power bill wouldnotbe prohibitively expensive. Training a large AI can be costly, but once trained it can be replicated many times with each copy able to run on a high-end personal computer using less than $10 of electricity per day.)
When anAI-driven robot makes something, a sandwich or a car, it creates new value: the difference between the raw materials and the final product. Similar value is also created if the robot mines gold or harvests lumber. If a human did the work, then that value would be split three ways: employer, human employee, government. However, when a robot does the work, there is no human employee in the split.
In essence, I'm suggesting that we find a way to put humans back into that equation. The way that seems most obvious to me is that the AI work should be taxed and the proceeds used to support American citizens through UBI, or something similar.

Admittedly, it's unclear how we should actually measure ""AI work"" in a reasonable way, but even if that were a fatal flaw in this proposal, the motivating problem ofAI taking over most jobsis still looming ahead. Whether it's taxing AI work or something else, we need to come up with some plan and start implementing it now.
We could have a bright future where people could live their lives comfortably, focused on their own passions instead of working for others. Or, if you want to see the alternative, go watch The Hunger Games.

California has intensified efforts to phase out natural gas appliances in recent years for what lawmakers claim will cut greenhouse gas emissions and improve indoor air quality. In 2022, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) approved a plan to ban the sale of new gas-powered space and water heaters by 2030, requiring homes and businesses to transition tozero-emission alternativeslike electric heat pumps. The state’s 2023 energy code also encourages all-electric construction, making it more costly for developers to install gas appliances.
""I hope the federal government weighs in and restores consumer choice in California,"" Gallagher said. ""We should be able to choose whether or not we want electric or gas, and we especially need to make those choices so we can ensure that we can afford to live in this state, because right now, electricity, because of [Gov.]Gavin Newsomand the Democrats policies, has exploded the prices through the roof.""
The Republicans are also requesting that the DOE ""engage legally with any California jurisdiction violating EPCA [Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975] in order to enforcethe federal preemptionof any state or local gas bans.""
""In light of these actions by a number of California state agencies, local governments, and regulatory bodies, we ask the Department of Energy to intervene where appropriate to overturn these overreaching policies,"" the letter stated.

Meanwhile,President Donald Trumphas directed the DOE to implement policies to bolster natural gas production and exports. Late last month, he signed an executive order declaring a national energy emergency, which includes measures to enhance domestic energy production.
""Expanding consumer choice and removing burdensome restrictions on household appliances is a key component of President Trump’s agenda for reducing costs for the American people,"" DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich told Fox News Digital on Wednesday.
While California — which has been a beacon of progressiveenvironmental policiesfor other liberal states — participates in the federal government's Appliance Standards Program, in some cases, the state's stringent standards exceed federal requirements. Dietderich said the department is ""conducting a comprehensive review and is working to advance a commonsense approach that prioritizes affordability and choice for all Americans"" when asked about the California Republicans' letter.
""Any standards should include a cost-benefit analysis considering the upfront cost of purchasing new products and reflecting actual cost savings for American families,"" Wright said in a statement last week while announcing his first secretarial order.

More than 70 cities in the Golden State, starting with Berkeley in 2019, enacted local ordinances prohibiting natural gas hookups in new buildings. However, a 2024federal court rulingoverturned Berkeley’s ban, prompting some municipalities to reconsider their policies. Meanwhile, the state legislature passed a bill requiring warning labels on gas stoves, citing health risks linked to indoor emissions. If signed into law, California would become the first state to ban gas appliances.
And California's Democratic majority has the backing of Gov.Gavin Newsom. In recent years, Newsom signed laws restricting new oil and gas wells near certain sites and signed off on neighborhoods to transition to all-electric systems. Additionally, in December 2024, state regulators approved a plan to reduce reliance on a major natural gas storage facility.

Achievement gaps are especially severe in big-city districts where teacher union bosses are calling the shots. In Detroit, nearly two-thirds of eighth graders are ""below basic"" readers. In Baltimore, 71% of eighth graders are ""below basic"" in math.
FIVE WAYS TRUMP AND MCMAHON CAN MAKE EDUCATION GREAT
It is a sad irony that the districts most loudly dedicated to ""equity"" are the districts where minority students are suffering the most. There is no ""equity agenda"" that does more for minority kids than teaching them how to read and do math. Sadly, inner-city schools are failing miserably at their core mission.
Reversing this educational catastrophe is not impossible; there are bright spots on the Nation’s Report Card that should be held up as a model for the nation.
For instance,Louisiana saw gainsin fourth- and eighth-grade reading and math, and it’s no mystery as to why: Over the past several years, the state has enacted new teacher training requirements related to literacy and embedded hundreds of literacy coaches in schools.
Perhaps best of all, Louisiana has refused to allow struggling readers to fall through the cracks: Three times a year, students in kindergarten through third grade participate in a literacy assessment that flags problems to facilitate early interventions. One such intervention, high-dose tutoring, is made available at a reduced cost to eligible families.
TRUMP'S WRITTEN A DEI GOVERNMENT DEATH SENTENCE. SCHOOL POLICIES SHOULD BE NEXT
There are myriad strategies for meeting students’ unique needs, but one failed strategy – throwing money at the problem – remains stubbornly popular.
TheElementary and Secondary School Education Relief(ESSER) Fund, created by Congress in 2020, became the largest education funding experiment in American history. An unprecedented $189.5 billion taxpayer dollars were sent to states and school districts through the ESSER fund, with very few strings attached.
The experiment proved that no dollar amount can fix poor school leadership. The Defense of Freedom Institute uncovered billions in wasteful ESSER expenditures, such as beach trips for administrators (Clark County, Nevada), DEI reparations (San Francisco), and hiring gender administrators (Milwaukee). Adults worked on their tans and lined their pockets while student learning suffered.

With the pandemic now behind us and a new administration in the White House, the need for sweeping reform has never been clearer. In Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee and Baltimore, fewer than 10% of eighth graders are proficient in math. Put another way, these districts are letting down 90% of their students.
These students, and all students, deserve the opportunity to escape failing schools. PresidentDonald Trumphas pledged to give it to them. He has already started making good on that promise through his executive order on Expanding Educational Freedom and Opportunity for Families.

The order directs incoming Education Secretary Linda McMahon to support state education leaders in freeing up federal education dollars for school choice programs. Of course, unleashing the maximum amount of federal dollars for education freedom would require shutting down the Education Department. As school choice expands and more families realize its benefits, support for shutting down the federal department is likely to grow.

When parents have school choice, public schools can no longer count on a captive audience that has no other option but to keep sending their students to schools that do not teach them anything. When schools must compete for students, they must prove their worth by providing a first-class education.
The coming years represent a generational opportunity to refocus America’s public schools on the basics that all students need to succeed. With hard work and a relentless commitment to America’s students, better reading and math scores are every bit as possible for this country as they are necessary for its future success.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-must-make-case-government-can-effective-good,Democrats must make the case that government can be effective and good,"Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., on Democrats seeking common ground with DOGE, an op-ed urging lawmakers to block Trump's election certification and the debate surrounding H-1B visas.
Eighty-eight years ago,President Franklin Rooseveltstood before the American people in Philadelphia and warned of an economic aristocracy that sought not just to dominate our markets but our democracy.
He spoke of those who amassed great wealth and then used that wealth to shape the laws of our nation and serve their own world view, rather than the public good. And he pledged that the government must serve the people, not the privileged few.
That same challenge exists today, but now it isbillionaires themselves taking over our government. They bankroll the campaigns, install their loyalists, and want to control the government so they can make the rules. They push for deep cuts to public education, including eliminating funding for decent schools and working-class neighborhoods to fund massive tax breaks for the investor class that we cannot afford.
Our task in this generation is to rebuild an economy that works for the many, not just for the mighty.(Leigh Vogel/WireImage | Michael Siluk/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)
They fight to deregulate social media platforms to grow the market value of companies in my district, just as the railroad barons of the past fought against every piece of regulation to protect their profits.
HOW DEMOCRATS CAN CRUSH REPUBLICANS ON THE ECONOMY AND WIN THE MIDTERMS
They move fast and break things, treating our government like their own personal experiment, blind to the millions of Americans who rely on their services and why? Because they believe they're entitled to rule.
They see themselves as an aristocracy of talent, a select few, whose wealth and success make them the rightful decision makers for the rest of us. In their eyes, business entrepreneurs, hedge fund managers andtech tycoonsare the engines of America's prosperity, while working families are expected to accept whatever scrapes trickle down.
They believe that democracy should cater to their vision, their profits and their power, no matter what the cost to society, they even refuse to accept what separates human beings from God, mortality itself.
We are in this moment because for decades Republicans have told us that government is bad. Democrats must have the courage to make the case that government is good and can work.
MY PLAN FOR THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY. WHAT I WILL – AND WON'T – DO
That means standing up for decent schools in working-class neighborhoods that rely on federal funds. It means defending Pell Grants that help kids from lower-income families go to college and student loans that millions, like me, took out and repaid to finish our education.
It means not hurting every American family with a special-needs kid who needs an IEP program and who depend on federal funding. It also meansprotecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid so that every American can live with dignity and retire with economic security.
We must ask ourselves, will we allow a handful of powerful interests to dictate the future of our economy, our jobs and our democracy, or will we reclaim the promise of an America where anyone who works hard can thrive?

PresidentDonald Trumpunveiled plans Sunday to halt production of the penny — but getting that initiative underway requires a few additional steps and possibly congressional approval.
Additionally, while Trump said he instructed the Treasury Department to stop minting them due to their high costs, supporters of the penny claim it’s wiser to evaluate changes to the nickel instead.
""For far too long, the United States has minted pennies which literally cost us more than 2 cents,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday. ""This is so wasteful! I have instructed my Secretary of the US Treasury to stop producing new pennies.""

In fact, producing pennies is even more expensive than Trump’s numbers. According to a 2024 U.S. Mint report, it costs nearly 3.69 cents to mint a single penny. The coins are primarily made of zinc and then covered in copper.
Trump’s statement comes after Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, who is heading up the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), posted on X in January how expensive minting pennies is.
DOGE is tasked with identifying ways to eliminate waste, and has so prompted changes, including gutting the $40 billion U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which provides aid to impoverished countries and development assistance.
Still, proponents of the penny exist. Americans for Common Cents, an organization that provides Congress and the White House with research on the value of the penny, claimed that efforts are better targeted at reducing the cost of the production for the nickel.
Nickels, worth five cents, cost approximately 13.8 cents to mint, according to the 2024 U.S. Mint report.
""The logical and fiscally responsible solution is not to eliminate the penny but to focus on producing a cheaper nickel,"" Americans for Common Cents Executive Director Mark Weller said in a Jan. 23 statement. ""This approach would address the real driver of losses while preserving the functionality of small denominations in everyday transactions.""
While the waters are a little murky on the next steps, experts say Congress likely would need to become involved and pass legislation to fulfill Trump’s wishes. And, historically, previous attempts in Congress to eliminate the coin have failed.

""The process of discontinuing the penny in the U.S. is a little unclear. It would likely require an act of Congress, but the Secretary of the Treasury might be able to simply stop the minting of new pennies,"" Robert Triest, an economics professor at Northeastern University,told the Northeastern Global News.
Even so, there is bipartisan interest on Capitol Hill to modify minting pennies. In 2023, Sens. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, and Maggie Hasson, D-N.H., reintroduced legislation to alter the composition of the penny to cut down on costs.
""It’s absolute non-cents that American taxpayers spend ten cents to make just one nickel. Only Washington could lose money making money,"" Ernst said in a statement in April 2023. ""This commonsense, bipartisan effort will modify the composition of certain coins to reduce costs while allowing for a seamless transition into circulation. A penny saved is a penny not borrowed.""

Even so, a composition change will unlikely yield cheaper results. The 2024 Mint Report said that options for different metal compositions aren’t available to reduce production costs down to face value.
There’s still some precedent for change though, and Congress has acted previously to discontinue minting new coins. The legislative branch authorized discontinuing new half-cent coins in 1857.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/trumps-dhs-deputize-irs-agents-immigration-enforcement,Trump’s Department of Homeland Security looking to deputize IRS agents for immigration enforcement,"President Donald Trump suggests moving nearly 90,000 IRS agents to help secure the southern border.
TheTrump administrationis looking to deputize Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agents to take on and assist with illegal immigration enforcement efforts, according to a senior official with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
DHS sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent requesting that the IRS provide agents to be used for immigration enforcement efforts by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
The senior DHS official said the expectation is that the request will be approved.
DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, who signed the letter, said President Donald Trump directed her agency to ""take all appropriate action to supplement available personnel to secure the southern border and enforce the immigration laws of the United States,"" even through use of the agency’s authority to deputize federal employees to perform immigration functions.

Through the implementation of Trump’s directive, Noem noted DHS has secured partnerships with a number of law enforcement officials, who have agreed to assist in carrying out the president’simmigration agenda.
For instance,DHS has deputizedlaw enforcement components of the Department of Justice, members of the Texas National Guard and law enforcement officials with the Texas Attorney General’s Office.
""Even with these resources available, more can be done to fully implement the Executive Order,"" Noem wrote. ""It is DHS’s understanding that the Department of Treasury has qualified law enforcement personnel available to assist with immigration enforcement, especially in light of recent increases to the Internal Revenue Service’s work force and budget.""

Noem also asked for agentsto help with targeting employers engaging in unlawful hiring practices, investigations into human smuggling and trafficking rings, seizing assets, contract oversight, apprehensions, detentions and removals.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/constitutional-crisis-impoundment-control-act-takes-center-stage-washington,'Constitutional crisis': The Impoundment Control Act takes center stage after Russell Vought's confirmation,"Fox News host Laura Ingraham reports that President-elect Donald Trump nominated Russ Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget again.
A power struggle concerning government spending is heating up inWashington, D.C., igniting what some Senate Democrats call a ""constitutional crisis"" amid the Trump administration’s efforts to curb government waste.
The conflict stems from PresidentDonald Trump's pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Russell Vought, and was exacerbated when the Trump administration announced it wouldfreeze federal grants and loanson Jan. 27 in an OMB memo.
Both Trump and Vought share a common point of contention: the Impoundment Control Act.
The 1974 law, which Trump and Vought both argue is unconstitutional,reasserts Congress' power of the purse and bars the executive branch from unilaterally side-stepping Congress and withholding appropriated funds.
However, many legal experts warn that the matter is not up for debate, and the courts are clear; it is unconstitutional for the executive branch to divert dollars Congress has authorized.
The Senate voted to confirm Vought on Thursday by a 53–47 margin along party lines, following a 30-hour delay from Democrats in protest against his nomination.
Republicans claim that Vought is qualified to lead the department because he previously served in that role during Trump’s first term. Sen. Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said Wednesday that Vought would ""be able to hit the ground running.""
However, Democrats remained staunchly opposed to Vought's nomination and claimed his views on impoundment disqualified him from the role, with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., arguing on Wednesday that Trump and Vought believe ""they may be above the law.""
However, what is the Impoundment Control Act? Here is a look at what's up for debate regarding government spending — and what changes could emerge during the Trump administration.
Article I of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the authority to manage the federal budget to determine funding decisions to balance power between the branches of government.
However, the act of impoundment occurs when the executive branch chooses to not spend these approved dollars from Congress, since the executive branch and the Office of Budget and Management do oversee the actual spending of the approved funds.
Should a president want to spend less than what Congress has budgeted, the executive branch must secure approval from Congress. Deferring funds also requires the executive branch to inform Congress.
As a result, Congress passed the 1974 Impoundment Control Act to establish these proper channels of congressional oversight if a president chooses to withhold or defer these funds.
‘ULTRA-RIGHT’: TRUMP BUDGET CHIEF PICK RUSSELL VOUGHT FACES FIRE FROM DEM SENATORS

Vought’s opponents voiced concern that his leadership would lead to more cases like thefreeze of federal grants and loans disclosed in an OMB memo on Jan. 27, a move that Democrats say was illegal and violated the Impoundment Control Act.
""As much as Trump desires it, the president is not a king,"" Senate Budget Committee ranking member Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., told reporters on Jan. 28. ""As much as Trump desires it, a law is not a suggestion.""
""These are not questions of opinion,"" Merkley said. ""These are principles at the heart of our constitutional system. It's at the heart of our checks and balances, and thus we have a constitutional crisis.""
Vought repeatedly defended his stance that the Impoundment Control Act was unconstitutional in multiple confirmation hearings and claimed that presidents historically could spend less than what Congress had earmarked prior to 1974.
Proponents of executive impoundment frequently point to Thomas Jefferson’s administration in 1803, when Congress appropriated funding for 15 gunboats. However, Jefferson held off on purchasing the boats to not aggravate France amid delicate discussions between then-Secretary of State James Madison and Napoleon. The purchase of the boats eventually became unnecessary following the Louisiana Purchase.
Additionally, Vought’s Center for Renewing America, a nonprofit Vought founded in 2021, has said impoundment allows the executive branch to exert fiscal discipline and that the president has the authority to determine if funds are used in the most efficient manner.
Vought did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.
However, according to multiple legal experts, the Constitution and the courts are clear that spending appropriations fall under the parameters of the legislative branch.
Michael McConnell, director of the Constitutional Law Center at Stanford Law School, told Fox News Digital, ""The president has the constitutional obligation to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and that includes spending.
""So I don't know where Mr. Vought gets the view that somehow the president has the right to decide what the government is going to spend money on,"" he said. ""This is Congress' job.""
Despite Trump and Vought’s views that the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional, McConnell said that he believed there is ""no reasonable prospect that the court is going to agree with that.
""The person who would have been the recipient of the funding will have some standing to sue,"" McConnell said. ""So, I would assume that if there's an impoundment, there will be an immediate lawsuit under the Impoundment Control Act.""

Other legal experts agreed that should the Trump administration attempt to withhold funds, the courts would step in and assert that there is no legal basis to do so.
That is because this is not a murky legal issue, according to Georgetown Law professor Stephen Vladeck.
""There are contested issues of constitutional law, but this just isn't one of them,"" Vladeck told Fox News Digital. ""Were it otherwise, there wouldn't be much point in having a legislative branch.""
Legal experts claim the courts historically have upheld the constitutionality of the Impoundment Control Act, and point to the 1975 case Train v. City of New York. In that case, the Supreme Court determined the Environmental Protection Agency must use full funding included in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972, even though then-President Richard Nixon issued orders not to use all the funding.
Vought himself admitted in a Jan. 22 confirmation hearing that no court of law has found the Impoundment Control Act unconstitutional.
The courts did step into action following the recent OMB memo outlining a pause in federal grants and loans, and two federal judges have temporarily blocked the freeze.
Although the White House did rescind the memo pausing the federal aid on Jan. 29, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the move did not equate to a ""rescission of the federal funding freeze.""
The White House did not respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital on Vought's nomination and comments from Democrats that the memo was ""illegal.""
The memo did not appear to alarm Republican leadership in Congress, who publicly characterized the pause as standard protocol during an administrative turnover.
""I think that's a normal practice at the beginning of administration, until they have an opportunity to review how the money is being spent,"" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters on Jan. 27. ""We'll see kind of what the extent of it is, and … what they intend to do in a more fulsome way. But for now, I think it's just, it's just kind of a preliminary step that I think most administrations take,"" Thune said.
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also told reporters on Jan. 27 the memo did not concern him and that he ""fully"" supported it, labeling the directive a ""common application of common sense.""
Even so, the memo further intensified opposition to Vought’s nomination. Specifically, Democrats urged the entire Senate to reject Vought’s nomination on Jan. 30 in response, following a committee vote advancing his nomination to the Senate floor.
Merkely noted that Vought oversaw the OMB in 2019 when the office held up $214 million in military aid for Ukraine — an issue that emerged as a key point in Trump’s first impeachment. Ultimately, the Government Accountability Office determined in 2020 the move did violate the Impoundment Control Act, ahead of Trump's Senate impeachment trial. The Senate ultimately voted to acquit Trump.
Therefore, Merkley characterized Vought as ""dangerously unfit"" to lead OMB and a ""dangerous threat to our constitutional system of representative democracy.""
Josh Chafetz, a professor at Georgetown Law, said such language such as ""constitutional crisis"" is reasonable considering Congress’s spending power is one of the few but critical ways the legislative branch ensures the executive branch doesn’t exert too much power.
""These kinds of impoundments are not just unconstitutional, but they're actually anti-constitutional,"" Chafetz told Fox News Digital. ""They strike at the very foundation of our constitutional order.""
Democrats also don’t believe the recent memo is an isolated incident. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. cautioned on Jan. 30 thatVought would seek to withhold fundsagain overseeing OMB — if the Senate confirms him.
Vought himself signaled the Trump administration could initiate reform on impoundment law. In a confirmation hearing on Jan. 22, Vought told lawmakers that while an exact strategy is not intact yet, the Trump administration plans to complete a review with the Justice Department to explore the ""parameters of the law with regard to the Impoundment Control Act,"" should the Senate confirm him.
Vought also noted that some lawmakers who agree with his position on impoundment have proposed legislation on the matter. For example, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced legislation in December 2024 to repeal the Impoundment Control Act, arguing that the law’s ""unconstitutional limitations"" on the executive branch have ""contributed to a fiscal crisis.""

While many legal experts agree the legislative branch is the proper channel for reforming the Impoundment Control Act, Chafetz doubts there is an appetite to do so and that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle would ultimately view such attempts as an ""attack on their institution.""

As a result, Vladeck said that the Trump administration only has two means to navigate the Impoundment Control Act: either adhere to it or modify it.
""As for what we can expect going forward, it's entirely possible that the administration will try to push the envelope,"" Vladeck said. ""But the onus ought to be on the administration to follow the procedure Congress and the president agreed to in 1974 — or to make the case for why he shouldn't have to.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-admin-files-motion-vacate-restraining-order-prohibiting-doge-access-treasury-payment-systems,Trump admin files motion to vacate restraining order prohibiting DOGE access to Treasury payment systems,"President Donald Trump told Fox News' Bret Baier in an interview ahead of the Super Bowl that he ""100%"" disagrees with a judge's order barring DOGE from accessing the Treasury.
TheTrump administrationhas filed a motion to vacate or modify a court's temporary restraining order blocking the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and political appointees from accessing sensitive Treasury Department payment records.
In the motion, Cloud Software Group, Inc. CEO Tom Krause argued that ""it is important that high-level political appointees, such as the Treasury Secretary, Deputy Secretary, Chief of Staff, and Under Secretaries, retain the ability to attend briefings concerning information obtained from the data or systems from Treasury employees with appropriate access to the data or systems in order to perform their job duties.""
Although Krause, who was working at Treasury as a special government employee, admitted that ""these high-level officials do not ordinarily need to receive access to or review data from such systems,"" he said an event could conceivably occur that could warrant them needing access.
Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly wrote in atemporary restraining orderon Saturday that ""political appointees, special government employees and any government employee detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department access to Treasury Department payment systems or any other data maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information.""

Anyone covered under those categories who was given previous access to the sensitive data must ""immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded from the Treasury Department’s records and systems,"" the judge said.
This comes after a group of 19 attorneys general filed a lawsuit against President Donald Trump, the U.S. Treasury and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent alleging that the Trump Administration illegally provided DOGE with unauthorized access to the Treasury Department’s payment systems.
Kollar-Kotelly had earlier said in a temporary restraining order on Thursday that Treasury officials ""will not provide access to any payment record or payment system of records maintained within the [Treasury] Bureau of Fiscal Service,"" a program that handles an estimated 90% offederal payments.

Thursday's order came a day after the Justice Department agreed in a proposed court order to limit access to the sensitive records to only two special government employees within DOGE who will have read-only permission. Kollar-Kotelly approved the motion in a brief order on Thursday.
The case in the Thursday order was brought by several government employee unions that sued over who could access the material as part of a government-wide evaluation of programs and systems led by DOGE. It argued that Bessent allowed DOGE improper access.

Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced that he has teamed up with the consummate supporter of every bad economic idea, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to introduce an arbitrary 10% cap on credit card interest rates, something that President Donald Trump did float during the election.
However, while Trump is doing a fantastic job of keeping promises, this is not one that should be kept.

First, I want to be clear that credit card interest rates are ridiculously high and generally shameful. I am also not a proponent of using debt for personal spending and believe that balances should only be carried in the case of a serious emergency. I have personally never run a credit card balance month-to-month and advise everyone to only purchase what they can afford.
THREE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TRUMP WILL FACE TRYING TO FIX BIDEN'S MISTAKES
But I am also not a proponent of many other things – whether that be gambling or buying expensive new cars – yet I don’t think the government should regulate them just because they arebad personal finance decisions.
And no, I don’t believe in ""usury"" either, as some like to throw around. But the government has no business getting involved in private credit underwriting/decisions.
While accessing credit is something that in my opinion should only be done for worthwhile investments, it is not my job, nor the government’s, to decide who should get access to credit.
SEN. SANDERS SAYS HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO TRUMP 'FULFILLING HIS PROMISE' ON CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATES
And capping credit card interest at 10% will ensure that fewer people have legal access to credit, as is the very predictable consequence of capping credit card interest.
If credit card interest is capped, particularly in a high-interest rate environment, expect many middle- and lower-class people to not be able to get credit at all.
That’s right – acap on interestis not going to lower costs for most people – it will raise them for the best borrowers and ensure that those without near-perfect credit don’t get access to it at all from financial institutions. Also, expect companies to charge more access fees to make up for any losses incurred from interest caps.

When people with lower credit ratings who desire credit are shut out by the banks (and, of course, everyone will scream how that is unfair), what happens? Those borrowers will then seek credit from alternative sources, including from bad actors whose ""bankruptcy"" and ""collection"" plans are much less palatable than those oflegal financial institutions, often accompanied by a broken arm or nose.
Moreover, anyone who would pick an interest rate cap as a random, hard number not tied to any financial standard (such as x basis points above the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), for example) should be entirely disregarded.
Good intentions do not equal good outcomes.

And, while I agree credit card rates are too high and people who can’t afford things shouldn’t be buying them except for emergency situations, that’s for them to decide by their own free will.
The best way to fight against high credit card rates is financial literacy and personal responsibility. The government, which runs deficits near 7% of GDP andhas its own debt problem, probably should worry about their debt position first.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trumps-tariffs-china-impact-drug-pricing-other-healthcare-costs,Here's how Trump's tariffs on China could impact drug pricing and other healthcare costs,"Former economic advisors Robert Wolf and Steve Moore weigh in on how President Donald Trump's tariffs affect the economy, on 'America Reports.'
PresidentDonald Trump'stariffs on China have raised significant concern over their potential impact on healthcare costs, but while the move could have a broad effect on the industry, it is likely they will not produce the devastating results that some may be expecting, health policy and trade experts say.
A survey by market research group Black Book Research found that 84% of the healthcare consumers they questioned said they expect to see higher costs due to increased pricing on medical treatments and drugs as a result of Trump's new tariffs. Buthealth policyexpert Chris Pope posited that healthcare is ""not a very highly tradable sector"" and that the sectors that do rely on trade relations, like pharmaceutical drugs or medical devices, will hinge on the magnitude of any Trump tariffs.
""There's not much international trade for most of healthcare. The biggest parts of healthcare – physician services, these are all provided domestically already, and hospitals are a domestic part of healthcare, so you take out those two things, and you've kind of ruled out almost three-quarters of all healthcare spending,"" Pope said in an interview with Fox News Digital. ""So, for the most part, we're talking about drugs and devices, which are, at most, about a quarter of healthcare spending.""
DEMS CLAIM TRUMP TARIFF COULD ‘DRIVE UP’ COSTS DESPITE DEFLECTING BLAME FROM BIDEN'S INFLATION
""In terms of prices for the industry, whether it's absorbed in their margins, or they do lessresearch and development,or they pass it on to consumers … it's not completely devastating, but it's definitely annoying,"" said Christine McDaniel, a senior economist at George Mason University's Mercatus Institute.

Experts say Trump's tariffs could have a broad impact on the industry, and it is hard to predict, but added that it is likely they will not have the devastating impacts that some may think.(Fox News)
Experts told Fox News that drug prices are among the most vulnerable aspects of the healthcare system, largely due to the U.S.' reliance on China for certain precursor chemicals and compounds that are essential for producing important medications. However, Pope said that the impact will likely only affect generic drugs and not branded drugs that are based on demand rather than supply. Generic drugs are already relatively cost-efficient, with many of them ranging under $10, he said.
Monica de Bolle is an immunologist and a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. She painted a bleaker picture of how many drugs could be impacted bythe tariffs.
‘MAKING AMERICA EXPENSIVE AGAIN’: DEMOCRATS FIND A TAX THEY DON'T LIKE IN TRUMP TARIFFS
""If you go through a list of the kinds of things that we import from China when it comes to active drug ingredients, or anything else that goes into the making of over-the-counter drugs, everything is in there. If you look at the list, it basically spans the range of potential medications that anyone takes at any point in their lives,"" said de Bolle. ""It includes things like over-the-counter NSAIDS, so non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs.""
She added that drugs that are more dependent on China includemedications for anxietyand other psychiatric disorders, such as antidepressants, and following Trump's tariffs, ""those prices are going to go up, for sure,"" she said.
Rising drug costs have become a concern for many following President Donald Trump's tariffs on China, which the United States relies on for many less-advanced drugs.(iStock)
Experts say costs in healthcare could also rise due to disruptions in thesupply chainfor medical devices, but they noted that the impact will be a lot harder to generalize, compared to the impact on drug pricing.
""Maybe before [the supply chain] was broken up into five stages. Well, now maybe they've broken it up into six or seven stages. So there are certain things that they have to stay in China for, or they have to source from China, but then they do the next step in India or another nearby country . . . which is going to be more expensive,"" McDaniel said.
‘THIS IS ABOUT FENTANYL’: TARIFFS ARE CRUCIAL TO COMBATING ‘DRUG WAR,’ TRUMP AND CABINET OFFICIALS SAY
However, Pope argued that prices could change, depending on the device and the magnitude of Trump's tariffs.
""It's going to vary a lot, according to where the devices are manufactured, where the components are manufactured, what kind of subsidies are available from other countries and domestically, and the degree of retaliation,"" he said.

While Trump's tariffs might be new, the experts say that getting out of China is not. Reducing the U.S.' dependency on Chinese products tied to healthcare, particularly drugs like antibiotics, has been talked about among lawmakers for some time due to the potentialnational securityrisks. Parallel to these discussions, companies have been preparing for future tariffs in light of increased geopolitical tensions.
""There has been a lot of discussion coming from both theDemocratic camp,as well as the Republican one, about the necessity to bring some of the production of certain types of drugs back to the U.S. to reduce dependency on China,"" said de Bolle. ""This whole deal about drugs and medical equipment and all of that that was under discussion before Trump. So, it's not even Trump-related.""

A federal judge's order barringDOGE from accessing Treasury Departmentdata is vague enough that some legal experts believe it even blocks the agency's secretary from reviewing records and systems, prompting Republicans to blast what they consider judicial overreach.
U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of New York Paul Engelmayer, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, issued a temporary restraining order Saturday that sided with 19 Democratic state attorneys general who claimed that giving DOGE ""full access"" to the Treasury’s payment systems violates the law. The lawsuit was spearheaded by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a longtime Trump foe who said her office is ""prepared to fight back"" afterPresident Donald Trump's Novemberelection win.
""The judge’s order is rightly being attacked as, at worse, barring the secretary of the Treasury from accessing the Treasury Department’s databases and at best, at being hopelessly ambiguous and confusing,"" the Federalist's senior legal correspondent Margot Cleveland told Fox News Digital on Sunday of the order.
The judge's sweeping order, issued Saturday, bars DOGE from accessing the Treasury system until at least Feb. 14, when Engelmayer scheduled a hearing to revisit the matter.

The language of the order specifically bars ""political appointees, special government employees, and any government employee detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department access to Treasury Department payment systems or any other data maintained by the Treasury Department containing personally identifiable information."" Trump, Secretary Scott Bessent and the U.S. Treasury are named as defendants in the case.

Conservatives and legal experts on social media have slammed the language of the order for reportedly also barring Bessent from Treasury data.
Fox News Digital reached out to the Treasury, White House and the Southern District on Sunday for comment, but did not immediately receive replies.
ELON MUSK'S DOGE MAKES ANOTHER HIRING PUSH
""To comprehend how bad Judge Engelmayer's decision was granting [a temporary restraining order] barring the Secretary of the Treasury Dept as well as DOGE & every other political appointee from accessing data, you need to compare to parallel case where a judge denied injunction,"" Cleveland posted to X.
Others on social media argued the order does not bar Bessent from accessing the data, only barring him from granting access to the data to political appointees, special government employees, and government officials outsideof the Treasury Department.
Cleveland told Fox News Digital on Sunday that beyond the vague language in the order, the attorneys general lack standing to challenge DOGE and the Treasury.
PRESIDENT TRUMP PREDICTS ELON MUSK WILL FIND 'HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS' IN WASTE IN NEXT DOGE DIRECTIVES
""There is a more fatal flaw to the [temporary restraining order]: The Plaintiffs utterly lack standing to challenge DOGE and the Treasury Department’s decision to grant read-only access to select members of that executive agency’s team. With read-only access, DOGE cannot possibly use access to the Treasury Department’s system to freeze grants to the Blue States or their citizens; nor does such read-only access subject Plaintiffs to a higher hack-risk.  And without standing, there is no basis to bring a lawsuit, much less to justify the TRO,"" she said.

Bessent sent a letter to Congress early last week detailing that DOGE was given ""read only"" access to the Treasury data, and that the investigation has ""not caused payments for obligations such as Social Security and Medicare to be delayed or re-routed.""
DOGE, led by Musk, has been on an investigation blitz of the federal government to stamp out government overspending and fraud. Musk reported after Engelmayer's ruling that DOGE had already reportedly uncovered fraud at the national treasury.
""[Friday], I was told that there are currently over $100B/year of entitlements payments to individuals with no SSN or even a temporary ID number. If accurate, this is extremely suspicious,"" Musk wrote hours after the ruling.
""When I asked if anyone at Treasury had a rough guess for what percentage of that number is unequivocal and obvious fraud, the consensus in the room was about half, so $50B/year or $1B/week!! This is utterly insane and must be addressed immediately.""
Vice President JD Vance also weighed in on the order Sunday, slamming it as a judge trying to control ""the executive's legitimate power.""

""If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,"" he posted to X.

HBO host Bill Mahergot real about the Democratic Party’s new leadership on Friday, saying it doesn’t reflect the party moving to give voters what they want.
The ""Real Time"" host torched the newly elected Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin, stating his election does not reflect that the party is making the changes it needs to win back voters.
""I was not aware of who he was before. I did not think it got off to a great start because I think they need to completely reroute themselves, and I don’t think they did it,"" Maher told his guest, MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes.
JOURNALISTS SOUND ALARM OVER TRUMP'S ‘PREPOSTEROUS’ GAZA COMMENTS, WARN OF ‘ETHNIC CLEANSING’
""Real Time"" host Bill Maher expressed he has little confidence that a new DNC chair means the Democratic Party is listening to the voters.
The DNCelected Ken Martin, the Minnesota party leader, to the position last Saturday, beating out Martin O'Malley, the former two-term Maryland governor.
Following his victory, he said, ""We have one team, one team, the Democratic Party. The fight is for our values. The fight is for working people. The fight right now is against Donald Trump and the billionaires who bought this country.""
During his program, Maher didn’t hide his frustrations with the new leader, accusing him of relaying the same tired talking point that the party employed up until their defeat last November.
""I mean, this Ken Martin guy, he said something I’ve heard Democrats say a lot, ‘We didn’t get our message out’ – And maybe I’m paraphrasing... And I’ve said this before to Democrats – No, you did. That’s the problem.""
""You did get your message out and people don’t like the message,"" he declared.
Maher reinforced his point later in the episode when talking to Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., and reporter Tara Palmeri. He paraphrased a line from a recentNew York Times article, stating, ""Many Americans say they do not believe the Democratic Party is focused on the issues that matter most to them.""

Continuing to read from The Times piece, Maher said, ""Here’s what people think is important to the Democrats, ‘abortion,L.G.B.T.Q. rightsand climate change.’""
The host pointed out that the party hasn’t prioritized the issues voters care about.
""To me, as a voter, my issues were democracy and the environment,"" he said, noting those weren’t focused on by the party. ""And now I have no one who’s a champion of those issues in the government, and I blame the Democrats for that.""
""The people do not feel they’re representing them, and they’re losing,"" he said, adding that The Times reported how voters saw ""the economy, inflation, healthcare and immigration"" as the main issues in the last election.

President Donald Trumphas for weeks suggested that Canada become the United States’ 51st state, and while opinion has been divided about whether Trump is serious or merely trolling its neighbor, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has reportedly said that it’s the former, according to reports.
In a closed-door meeting with Canadian business and labor leaders, Trudeau reportedly affirmed that Trump’s ambitious aims of annexation are ""a real thing.""
""Mr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country and it is a real thing. In my conversations with him on …"" Trudeau said before the microphone cut out, according to CBC.

TRUMP IMPOSES TARIFFS ON IMPORTS FROM CANADA, MEXICO AND CHINA: 'NATIONAL EMERGENCY'
The news media had been asked to leave the room before Trudeau delivered his comments, but CBC and The Toronto Star were able to hear them and record them.
""I suggest that not only does the Trump administration know how many critical minerals we have, but that may be even why they keep talking about absorbing us and making us the 51st state,"" Trudeau added according to people in the room who listened to his comments. ""They’re very aware of our resources, of what we have, and they very much want to be able to benefit from those.""
Gil McGowan, president of the Alberta Federation of Labor, confirmed what Trudeau said in a post on social platform X.
""Yes, I can confirm that Trudeau said his assessment is that what Trump really wants is not action on fentanyl or immigration or even the trade deficit, what he really wants is to either dominate Canada or take it outright,"" McGowan wrote. ""Tariffs are a tactic towards that end.""
Trump first pitched the idea during a dinner at Mar-a-Lago with Trudeau in late November. Trump has also suggested annexing Greenland.
Canada is home to more than 40 million people and is a founding NATO partner. It is a natural resource-rich nation that provides the U.S. with commodities such as oil.
Trump has long said Canada – as well as Mexico – has failed to do enough to prevent the flow ofillegal migrantsand drugs, particularly fentanyl into the U.S. In addition, Trump claims the U.S. has subsidized Canada to the tune of $200 billion annually.

CANADA WILL NOT BE '51ST STATE,' AMBASSADOR PROTESTS AMID TRUMP TARIFF THREAT
Last weekend, Trump again repeated his suggestion of absorbing Canada, noting that it would not be subjected to his incoming tariffs should the country join the U.S.
""We pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars to SUBSIDIZE Canada. Why? There is no reason,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""We don’t need anything they have. We have unlimited Energy, should make our own Cars, and have more Lumber than we can ever use. Without this massive subsidy,Canada ceases to existas a viable Country. Harsh but true!""
""Therefore, Canada should become ourCherished 51st State,""Trump added. ""Much lower taxes, and far better military protection for the people of Canada – AND NO TARIFFS!""
But Trump agreed to pause the tariffs for 30 days on Monday after a call with Trudeau, who made some concessions to temporarily stave off the levies.
Trudeau said Canada will implement a $1.3 billion border plan and appoint a fentanyl czar. In addition, Canada will reinforceits borderwith new helicopters, technology, personnel and enhanced coordination with American authorities. He added that nearly 10,000 personnel are and will be working on border protection.
""We will list cartels as terrorists, ensure 24/7 eyes on the border, launch a Canada-U.S. Joint Strike Force to combat organized crime, fentanyl and money laundering,"" Trudeau wrote on X. ""I have also signed a new intelligence directive on organized crime and fentanyl and we will be backing it with $200 million.""

The U.S. imports approximately 60% of its crude oilfrom Canada, with Alberta alone supplying 4.3 million barrels per day. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. consumes about 20 million barrels a day, while domestically producing about 13.2 million barrels a day. This means about a quarter of the oil the U.S. consumes every day is from Canada.
Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day.
Meanwhile, Canada is home to dozens of minerals considered critical for use in various industries, including for electric car batteries, solar panels, and semiconductors, according to the New York Times.

A federal judge on Friday said he would not immediately block the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, from accessing systems at the Labor Department.
U.S. District Judge John Bates said he had concerns about DOGE but that the labor unions who sued to block their access to the systems have not yet provided evidence of any legal injury.
""Although the court harbors concerns about defendants’ alleged conduct, it must deny plaintiffs’ motion at this time,"" Bates wrote.
The Labor Department has investigated companies like SpaceX and Tesla that are owned byElon Musk, who leads DOGE, and keeps records on these investigations. The department also has information about these companies' competitors' trade secrets, the unions said in the lawsuit.

The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has investigated and fined SpaceX and Tesla over worker safety, the unions said.
The Labor Department's systems contain medical and financial records of millions of Americans, including those who have filed safety complaints about their employers.
The ruling comes after theTrump administrationagreed earlier this week that DOGE would not receive access to the Labor Department until this court decision.

Musk’s DOGE team had gained access to sensitive Treasury Department payment systems, although a judge has since blocked that access to Treasury records containing sensitive personal data such as Social Security and bank account numbers for millions of Americans. DOGE has also largely dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development and offered financial incentives to millions of federal workers to resign.
""At every step, DOGE is violating multiple laws, from constitutional limits on executive power, to laws protecting civil servants from arbitrary threats and adverse action, to crucial protections for government data collected and stored on hundreds of millions of Americans,"" labor union lawyers represented by the advocacy group Democracy Forward wrote.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fentanyls-financial-grip-us-skyrocketed-2-7-trillion-height-biden-admin-study,Fentanyl's financial grip on US skyrocketed to $2.7T at height of Biden admin: study,"Fox News medical contributor Marc Siegel joined 'FOX & Friends' to discuss the growing problem with the spread of carfentanil, which is 100 times more powerful than fentanyl.
FIRST ON FOX:The opioid crisis under theBiden administrationcost the U.S. $2.7 trillion in 2023 alone, a new study exclusively obtained by Fox News Digital shows.
The Council of Economic Advisers, an agency within the executive office that advises the president on economic policy, on Friday released a study detailing that the opioid epidemic cost the U.S. $2.7 trillion in 2023 when considering costs related to loss of life, loss of quality of life, loss of labor force productivity, crime and costs to the healthcare system.
The opioid epidemic has raged for years, primarily inflamed by the use of fentanyl, which is a synthetic opioid that chiefly originates in China and comes to the U.S. over the Mexico border.
PresidentDonald Trumpis in the midst of leveraging tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China to bolster border security and stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S., which has sparked condemnation from critics that the tariffs will lead to higher costs for U.S. consumers purchasing goods originating from those three nations.
The study, however, argues that the costs of the opioid epidemic ""dwarfs even pessimistic estimates of the effects of tariffs.""

""Ever since his first entry into politics back in 2015, President Trump has been committed to tackling the opioid epidemic that is destroying American lives, families, and communities,"" White House deputy press secretary Kush Desai told Fox News Digital on Friday.
""While Democrats cry foul and drum up hysteria over his use of tariff powers to save American lives from the scourge of illicit drugs like fentanyl, President Trump isn’t going to waver from using every lever of executive and legislative power to put Americans and America First — the costs of standing idly by in this drug war clearly far outweigh the exaggerated costs of fighting for American lives,"" he said.
The Council of Economic Advisers study used a 2017 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that researchers adjusted to account for inflation trends, and opioid deaths and dependency, since its release.
The loss of life in 2023, for example, cost the U.S. $1.11 trillion, with the study explaining that researchers multiplied the74,702 opioid deaths that year""by value of statistical life in the United States and then adding productivity and healthcare costs that arise due to opioid fatalities.""

""We inflation-adjusted the $10.1 million value of a statistical life number provided by NIH (2017) to 2025 dollars ($13.0 million per life),"" the study explained.

Another $1.34 trillion of the $2.7 trillion total accounts for loss of quality of life for those in the midst of opioid addiction compared to Americans who are healthy and not addicted.
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH TRUMP'S TARIFFS ON CHINA, CANADA AND MEXICO?
""The measure shows that life with OUD [opioid use disorder] has about 60 percent (0.626) of the quality of life of those in full health,"" the study found. ""Second is a measure of how much Americans value a year of life in full health. Adjusted for inflation, this value is estimated at $624,410 per person per year. Together these values imply that the lost quality of life costs $234,478 per year for each person living with OUD. We then multiply this value by the prevalence of OUD, estimated to be 5.7 million in 2023.""
The opiod crisis cost the U.S. health care system an estimated $107 billion in 2023, the study found, when accounting for treatment of individuals with opioid use disorder, relative to the average annual cost of treating patients who do not have an opioid addiction.

""This amounts to $19,000 additional dollars per year per person with OUD,"" the study detailed. ""These costs were primarily borne by private insurers, Medicaid, and hospitals providing uncompensated care. Ultimately, these costs are passed on to all Americans through higher insurance premiums, taxes, and healthcare expenses.""
Loss of labor productivitydue to the opioid crisis cost the U.S. an estimated $107 billion, the study found. Researchers determined that figure by multiplying the number of productive work hours lost due to opioid-related deaths, addiction and incarceration by the average hourly wages and benefits for U.S. employees.
Crime was the final component in the study. The report found that police protection, court proceedings, correctional facility use and property loss stemming from opioid-related crime cost the U.S. $63 billion.
‘MAKING AMERICA EXPENSIVE AGAIN’: DEMOCRATS FIND A TAX THEY DON’T LIKE IN TRUMP TARIFFS
""The enormous economic cost of the illicit opioid epidemic to Americans, estimated at $2.7 trillion in 2023 alone, underscores the urgent need to control the flow of lethal drugs pouring in from foreign countries. The human suffering and financial burden inflicted by this epidemic are unsustainable,"" the conclusion of the study found.
Trump and his administration are in the midst of a border security blitz, with law enforcement agencies stretching from the Department of Homeland Security to U.S. Marshals conducting raids across the nation to deport illegal immigrants and prevent the flow of other illegal migrants entering the nation.
As part of the immigration plan, Trump announced tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China at the end of January, which included a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% tariff on imports from China. Energy resources from Canada were set to have a lower tariff, at 10%.
The executive order that authorized the tariffs, which Trump signed Saturday, said they were created in light of ""extraordinary"" threats stemming from ""illegal aliens and drugs, including deadly fentanyl.""

Critics of the tariffs have slammed them as leading to higher costs for American spenders, citing that goods stretching from Mexican beer, Canadian lumber and imported Chinese electronics would see a rise in costs for Americans.
""It’s going to affect beer, OK,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said during a press conference in his New York office on Sunday, while warning against the tariffs and holding up a tall can of Corona Extra. ""Most of it, Corona here, comes from Mexico.""
""It’s going to affect your guac — because what is guacamole made of? Avocados. If you have pizza, it's going to affect the cost of cheese,"" he said.
Goldman Sachs estimated that the U.S. would take a 0.4% hit to the GDP over the tariffs.
The Council of Economic Advisers study, however, argued that costs related to the opioid epidemic dwarf costs related to tariffs.

On his first day in office, Scott Turner made a bold move as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
He directed agency staff to suspend all pending and future enforcement actions related to the Obama-era Equal Access Rule, which required HUD-funded programs and shelters to determine eligibility based on a person's self-identified gender.
Turner said that the move was part of PresidentDonald Trump'sagenda to ""restore biological truth to the federal government.""
""We want to protect the ladies entering any HUD facilities,"" Turner told reporters Thursday, adding that he wants to ""restore equal rights, but no extra rights."" The Secretary added that most of the females who utilizeHUD sheltersalready come from domestic violence situations, and he wants to ensure that their tragedies are not exacerbated when they turn to the federal government for help.
TRUMP'S PICK AS HUD SECRETARY, A FORMER NFL PLAYER, SAYS HE WANTS TO HELP AMERICANS GET OFF GOVERNMENT AID
Trump's newly confirmed HUD Secretary Scott Turner is rescinding rules prohibiting federally funded shelters from asking for proof of someone's biological gender.
Turner's directive follows Trump'sDay Oneexecutive order terminating federal diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives and mandating the federal government only recognize two genders, male and female. This week, Trump signed an executive order preventing biological males who identify as females from competing on women's sports teams, as well as another prohibiting minors from receiving puberty blockers or transition surgery.
Under the 2016Equal AccessRule that Turner is rescinding, homeless shelters, domestic violence shelters and other federally funded HUD-assisted housing programs were prohibited from requiring people to prove they are biologically female. Following Turner's directive, this will no longer be prohibited.
""The President was proud to take part in Mr. Turner’s nomination ceremony yesterday at The White House, and is pleased to see he’s hitting the ground running in executing the President’s Day One order to halt any and all DEIA programs that are at odds with the administration’s policies,"" White House spokesman Harrison Fields told Fox News Digital in a statement.

In 2018, nineCaliforniawomen filed a lawsuit against a local women's shelter in Fresno, which operates with public funds, for allegedly forcing them to take showers alongside a biological male who identified as a woman and who they claimed sexually harassed them.
Last year, police in Greenville,South Carolina,arrested a transgender woman, Michelle Silva Perez, for stabbing a shelter employee after Perez was admitted to the emergency shelter meant only for women and mothers. The facility, which receives both state and federal funding, said it would have acted differently if it had known that the suspect was not a biological woman.

Further, Trump laid out to House Republicans that he is looking to ""eliminate all the special tax breaks for billionaire sports team owners; close the carried interest tax deduction loophole,"" and institute ""tax cuts for Made in America products.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-tees-up-trump-budget-chief-pick-russell-vought-final-confirmation-vote,Senate tees up Trump budget chief pick Russell Vought for final confirmation vote,"Fox News host Laura Ingraham reports that President-elect Donald Trump nominated Russ Vought to lead the Office of Management and Budget again.
The Senate on Wednesday advanced PresidentDonald Trump’spick to lead the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Russell Vought, to a final confirmation vote.
The cloture motion passed with a strictly party-line vote, 53-47. The entire Democratic caucus opposed Vought, as they promised to do.
Republicans have backed Vought’s nomination and claim he is prepared for the role since he led the office during Trump’s first administration. But Democrats remain staunchly opposed due to Vought's stance on the Impoundment Control Act – a 1974 law that reinforces Congress’ power of the purse.
Vought told lawmakers in multiple confirmation hearings he believes the act is unconstitutional, and argued presidents historically could spend less than what Congress had approved prior to the legislation.

Vought’s statements on the issue left Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., ""astonished and aghast"" during a confirmation hearing with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC).
""I think our colleagues should be equally aghast, because this issue goes beyond Republican or Democrat,"" Blumenthal said last month. ""It’s bigger than one administration or another. It’s whether the law of the land should prevail, or maybe it’s up for grabs, depending on what the president thinks.""
Some Republicans have also appeared concerned with Vought’s views on impoundment. Senate Budget Committee Chair Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said last month he also shared some concerns and would disclose them at a markup hearing for Vought’s nomination.
Meanwhile, other Republican lawmakers share Vought's stance on impoundment. For example, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, introduced legislation in December 2024 that would repeal the Impoundment Control Act.
Lee argued that the law’s ""unconstitutional limitations"" on the executive branch have ""contributed to a fiscal crisis.""

Vought’s nomination sparked additional outrage after theOMB issued a memolate last month ordering a pause on all federal grants and loans aiming to eradicate ""wokeness"" and the ""weaponization of government"" to improve government efficiency.
The White House rescinded the memo two days later, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the move didn’t equate to a ""recission of the federal funding freeze"" and that the executive orders mentioned in the memo still remain in effect.
Democrats claimed the memo was an attempt to bypass Congress and was an overreach of power from the executive branch.
""As much as Trump desires it, the president is not a king. As much as Trump desires it, a law is not a suggestion,"" Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., Budget Committee ranking member, told reporters.
In response, Democrats urged the Senate to reject Vought’s nomination following a Budget Committee vote to advance him, cautioning that Vought would attempt to impound funds again if he’s confirmed.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/unions-sue-trump-administration-arbitrary-capricious-employee-buyout-offers,Unions sue Trump administration over ‘arbitrary and capricious’ federal employee buyout offers,"Fox News' Peter Doocy reports the latest on the offer from the White House. Doocy and the 'Fox & Friends' co-hosts also discuss the decision to pull Gen. Mark Milley's security detail and Karoline Leavitt's first White House press conference.
As a deadline looms for government employees to fold to an ultimatum given by the Trump administration to either accept a buyout or return to the office,unions representing those workershave filed a lawsuit, calling the offer ""arbitrary and capricious.""
The Trump administration is offering buyouts for nearly 2 million federal employees, including those who work remotely, as part of PresidentDonald Trump’s efforts to get employees back into the office, but they only have until Feb. 6 to opt-in.
Under the buyout offer, the employee will stop working this week and receive pay benefits through Sept. 30.
Exempt from the offer are public safety employees, like air traffic controllers.

During Trump’s first week in office, he issued several directives to the federal workforce, including a requirement that remote employees must return to in-person work.
With a deadline quickly approaching, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) and two other unions filed a complaint, claiming the buyout offer is ""arbitrary and capricious"" and violates federal law.""
The unions allege the administration cannot guarantee the plan will be funded and has failed to consider the consequences of mass resignations, including how it may affect the government’s ability to function.

On Tuesday, AFGE filed a lawsuit calling for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt the Trump administration’s ""Fork Directive"" deadline of Feb. 6 and require the government to articulate a policy that is lawful, not arbitrary and unlawful.
The union said the ""Fork Directive"" is the administration’s latest attempt to remove public service workers and replace them with partisan loyalists. The group also says the directive amounts to a clear ultimatum to a sweeping number of federal employees: ""resign now or face the possibility of job loss without compensation in the near future.""
But the unions say the package being offered violates the law because the funds used to pay the employees who accept the offer have not been appropriated for that reason.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OFFERS BUYOUTS TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING REMOTE WORKERS: 'DEFERRED RESIGNATION'
""AFGE is bringing this suit with our partners today to protect the integrity of the government and prevent union members from being tricked into resigning from the federal service,"" AFGE National President Everett Kelley said. ""Federal employees shouldn’t be misled by slick talk from unelected billionaires and their lackeys. Despite claims made to the contrary, this deferred resignation scheme is unfunded, unlawful, and comes with no guarantees. We won’t stand by and let our members become the victims of this con.""
Last week, a government-wide email was sent out to ensure all federal workers were on board with the Trump administration’s plan.
The email pointed to four pillars that Trump set forth, to bring accountability back to the federal government, including a return to in-person work, restored accountability for employees who have policymaking authority, restored accountability for senior executives, and a reformed federal hiring process based on merit.
The email noted that the majority of federal employees who have workedremotely since COVIDwill be required to return to their physical offices five days a week.
For those who returned to office, the Trump administration thanked them for their ""renewed focus"" on serving the American people. But the future of their position could not be guaranteed, according to the email.

The buyouts do not apply to military personnel of the armed forces, postal service employees, positions related to immigration enforcement and national security, and any other positions specifically excluded by the agency the federal workers are employed by.
The White House is expecting a ""spike"" in federal resignations ahead of a Thursday deadline for a buyout offer, Fox News Digital has learned.

""The number of deferred resignations is rapidly growing, and we’re expecting the largest spike 24 to 48 hours before the deadline,"" a White House official told Fox News Digital on Tuesday morning.

Scott Turner, a former NFL player and Texas state lawmaker, advanced past a key procedural hurdle in the Senate on Tuesday night, teeing up a final confirmation vote to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) later this week.
The nomination cleared the procedural vote by a margin of 55-45, with two Democrats joining Republicans.
PresidentDonald Trumpannounced Turner as his choice to be HUD secretary soon after his November election last year.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/immigration-think-tank-cooks-up-scheme-use-snitches-force-migrants-self-deport,Immigration think tank cooks up scheme to use ‘snitches’ to force migrants to self-deport,"MSNBC host Katie Phang and her guest attacked plans by President Donald Trump to house criminal illegal immigrants at Guantanamo Bay during her show.
An immigration think tank has proposed a unique method of aidingPresident Donald Trump’sdeportation efforts, supplementing typical enforcement efforts by relying on ""snitches"" to limit the employment opportunities of illegal immigrants.
The Center for Immigration Studies (CIS)released a reportdetailing a plan to force ""self-deportations"" of illegal immigrants. The proposal suggests a minor amendment to the tax code aimed at punishing employers who hire illegal immigrants by allowing private citizens to sue businesses that do this, forcing them to comply with the E-Verify system and limiting the employment opportunities for migrants.
The proposal, authored by Ajay Gupta, acknowledges Trump’s enforcement efforts but argues the president will be ""limited in scope"" when it comes to traditional deportation methods, which could be supplemented by forcing manyillegal migrantsto leave the country voluntarily.
""Notwithstanding its ‘shock and awe,’ a forcible deportation drive is unlikely to make a dent in that vast population,"" the report argues. ""For this, the law against hiring these aliens would have to be strictly enforced.""

TRUMP ADMIN ENDS DEPORTATION PROTECTIONS FOR MASSIVE NUMBER OF VENEZUELANS AMID ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION CRACKDOWN
The report cites Britain’s 19th century plan to eradicate child labor as an example of the concept's success, noting that the country was able to force compliance with labor laws even though it was limited by resources and budgetary constraints.
Britain’s effort relied on private enforcement of the law, the report notes, something the U.S. proposal would also do by allowing private citizens to sue employers of illegal immigrants.
""The proposal would impose a punitive tax on all who pay for the personal services or labor of unauthorized aliens and let private citizens sue to collect this tax,"" the report argues. ""The ubiquity of snitches, as compared to the distant possibility of government action, is likely to put the fear of God in employers. Most, if not all, would then willingly embrace E-Verify, a free online tool for verifying a prospective hire’s work-authorization status.""
According to the report, the result would make it much more difficult for illegal immigrants to obtain employment, which ""should induce large numbers of unauthorized aliens to return home.""
The CIS proposal is not the first time such an idea has been floated in the U.S. FormerSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, advocated for a similar measure during his 2012 bid for president.

""The answer is self-deportation, which is people decide they can do better by going home because they can't find work here because they don't have legal documentation to allow them to work here,"" Romney said during a Republican primary debate in 2012.
Romney’s proposal was widely mocked at the time, including by Trump, who called the idea ""maniacal"" and ""crazy,"" according to a 2012 NewsMax report.
But Romney’s idea also had high-profile defenders, includingFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, who now serves in Trump’s administration as secretary of state.

""I've never understood self-deportation, in what the governor has presented, as a policy. It's not a policy,"" Rubio said a few months after Romney’s initial proposal, according to an ABC News Report. ""I think it's an observation of what people will do in a country that's enforcing its immigration laws.""
According to the CIS report, a renewed push for self-deportation could be accomplished by amending current tax law through budget reconciliation, which would only require a simple majority vote in the Senate and potentially bypass Democratic efforts to block the legislation.

""Republicans today have the legislative and executive authority to fully implement the proposal presented here. This implementation would require adding little more than some 650 words to a budget reconciliation bill. And its consequence would force all employers nationwide to comply with E-Verify,"" the CIS report concluded.
""If GOP lawmakers in control of both chambers of Congress refrain from even this undemanding legislative task, their electorate would be justified in concluding that they accord a higher priority to not placing even the slightest added burden on employers than they do on removing illegal aliens.""

Americans have renewed optimism in the country’s economic outlook now thatPresident Donald Trumpis back in office.
A majority of Americans, 53%, believe thatthe economywill grow in the next six months, while 61% believe that the stock market will also rise, according to the results of a Gallup poll released Monday.
The poll’s release comes shortly after Trump returned to the White House, with the survey conducted between Jan. 2 and 15, shortly before he took office.

While Americans are optimistic about economic growth, the survey found they were divided on unemployment, with 38% indicating they believe it will increase and 38% saying it will decrease. Meanwhile, 21% believe that unemployment will hold steady over the next six months.
Americans are also less bullish on inflation, with 52% indicating they expect it to rise in the next six months, though that figure is down significantly from close to 80% in previous versions of the Gallup poll.

""But the broader improvements in Americans’ outlook may also reflect their confidence in Trump’s ability to handle the economy. During his first term, he received some of his strongest issue approval ratings on the economy, which were typically higher than those Biden received on the issue during his term.""

https://www.foxnews.com/media/us-heading-towards-economic-heart-attack-debt-cut-soon-hedge-fund-founder,US heading towards economic ‘heart attack’ if debt is not cut soon: World’s largest hedge fund founder,"House Majority Leader Steve Scalise speaks about House Republicans' plans to wrestle with several fiscal deadlines.
The United States is currently in a ""death spiral"" of debt that could lead to an economic ""heart attack"" if both parties do not work together tostart cutting immediately, according to Ray Dalio, the founder of the world's largest hedge fund.
During a recent conversation on""The All-In Podcast""with co-host David Friedberg, Dalio noted that a ""death spiral"" typically refers to when a company or government has too much debt and must borrow to service it. According to Dalio, investors are acutely aware of this, which is causing credit to get worse and interest rates to increase.
Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, says this is the worst thing that can happen to a heavily indebted entity. He notes that the key question is whether the debt creates a large enough income to mitigate this issue.
""That's like, I don't know, eating vegetables or something. It's a healthy process. And if not, credit begins to build up this debt, it begins to become like plaque in the arteries. And you can measure it just like you could measure it in the arteries, and you can see how it constricts that circulatory system,"" Dalio told ""All-In.""

Ray Dalio, the founder of the world’s largest hedge fund, warned ""The All-In Podcast"" co-host David Friedberg of serious economic consequences is the national debt is not addressed quickly.(The All-In Podcast)
If interest and debt service continuously constrict a government's money supply, Dalio claims this can lead to an ""economic debt heart attack.""
A large amount of debt creates the need for somebody to buy it. Debt risks not only create the urgency for new supply to be offered, but holders may also sell those debt assets, leading to an overwhelming supply relative to demand, according to Dalio.
In the event that the debt service burden rises or there is a big supply-demand imbalance, the government's central bank can print more money and buy it. If they do not, the price of the debt must rise to constrict borrowing, snowballing to the constriction of non-existent credit, in turn weakening the economy and causing bad economic conditions.
Dalio says the government can let that happen or print money and buy the debt to monetize it. However, this willcause inflationand lower the value of the debt.
""In either case, you don't want to hold that debt because either there's a debt service problem or there's a depreciation,"" he adds.
BLACK CAUCUS CHAIR ACCUSES TRUMP OF 'PURGE' OF 'MINORITY' FEDERAL WORKERS
The U.S. national debt has exceeded $36 trillion.(All-In Podcast/Jemal Countess/Peter G. Peterson Foundation/Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
Today, the U.S. has $36.4 trillion offederal government debtand a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 29.1 trillion, giving a debt-to-GDP ratio of 125%. This ratio has climbed steadily since the pandemic began in 2020, when the federal government debt was $20 trillion, and GDP was just $21 trillion. Since the pandemic, federal government debt has risen by 80%, while GDP has climbed by 38%.
Despite recent efforts to cut interest rates again, markets have traded treasuries down, causing the long-term interest rates of U.S. debt to spike up to levels not felt since just before the 2008 global financial crisis. To keep the economy growing, the U.S. government is running a nearly $2 trillion annual deficit, nearly 7% of GDP, while paying over $1 trillion per year in interest alone on the existing outstanding debt.
Dalio expressed a sense of urgency in relation to mounting debt, wading into the potential benefits of theDepartment of Government Efficiency (DOGE)and how the need to cut costs will inevitably accentuate already entrenched political divisions.
Touting his personal solution, Dalio said the deficit, which is the equivalent of bonds selling, must be cut from 7.5 percent down to 3 percent of GDP.
DOGE ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $1B IN SAVINGS AFTER CANCELING 104 FEDERAL DEI CONTRACTS

""Different people have different views as to how to cut it. Forget it. I don't really care,"" Dalio said. ""Just, you have to have a unified agreement. Everybody in Congress and the president and so on should pledge to do that. And then the question is how to do it. But they should know that number (equivalent to around 900 billion a year).""
Dalio worries that the timeline to close this gap may be too long. He says it's not just a matter of DOGE but also less regulation and productivity changes, which could, in part, come from artificial intelligence (AI) or even revenue produced by tariffs and translate into profit.
When asked if America is better off withPresident Donald Trumpversus former President Biden in the financial context, Dalio said, ""Yes, I do believe we are.""
""In terms of profitability and the likelihood of cutting, I think the Republicans are probably more likely to make these moves than the Democrats. But you also have to take into consideration the impacts, the social impacts and the other impacts that are going to come from this. We're at a civil war internally and we're at an international war simultaneously. So, there are second-order effects. I think the main thing is to take those numbers and make them real at 3 percent,"" he continued.

But these cuts will be brutal, according to Dalio. He notes that ""how the pie is divided"" with respect to government budgeting is going to be very political and the ""disruptive effects will be enormous.""
""We're really all guessing on how disruptive those effects will be. It's too much of a – but you're absolutely right. Lots of jobs are going to be lost,"" he said. ""Lots of change is going to happen in terms of turbulence. And do we have a plan? How could we even agree on a plan of how to deal with that?

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/speakers-lobby-palpably-unfair-act,The Speaker’s Lobby: A palpably unfair act,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss DOGE taking aim at USAID spending and Elon Musk calling the agency a 'criminal organization.'
Referee Shawn Hochuli educated football fans recently on Rule 12, Section 3, Article 4 of the NFL rulebook.
Hochuli threatened to give thePhiladelphia Eaglesan automatic touchdown after the Washington Commanders committed three consecutive penalties at the goal line during the NFC Championship Game.
Washington linebackerFrankie Luvu launched himself twice – mimicking Superman in mid-flight – diving over the line of scrimmage before the Eagles snapped the ball at the one-yard line. Luvu was trying to prevent Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts from sneaking into the end zone behind his massive linemen.
Hochuli slid the ball closer to the goal line after each infraction. ""Half the distance to the goal line"" is the sanction, meaning the ball advanced a few centimeters each time and Philadelphia got a new set of downs. But following the second infraction, Hochuli announced he’d assess Luvu an unsportsmanlike penalty if he did it again.
SPENDING SHOWDOWN: REPUBLICANS WILL NEED TO CORRAL VOTES – BUT THEY HAVEN'T ASKED, YET
Luvu didn’t.
But on the third play, Washington defensive tackle Jonathan Allen hopped briefly offside before the snap.
Hochuli blew the whistle, assessed a penalty for encroachment and moved the ball forward until its nose practically kissed the goal line chalk.
Unlike football, there's no obscure, baked-in rule allowing detractors of a ""palpably unfair"" act to supersede it – which might just spell hard luck for critics of President Trump's freezing of already-allocated federal funds.(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)
The referee then tutored the nation on one of the most obscure rules in any athletic rulebook.
""Washington has been advised that the referees can award a score if this type of behavior happens again,"" said Hochuli, much to the delight of the partisan crowd stuffed into Lincoln Financial Field in south Philly.
The rule declares the following:
""A player or substitute shall not interfere with play by any act which is palpably unfair. Penalty: For a palpably unfair act: Offender may be disqualified. The referee, after consulting the officiating crew, enforces any such distance penalty they consider equitable and irrespective of any other specified code penalty. The referee may award a score.""
THE POLITICAL FIRESTORM THAT'S ABOUT TO SINGE CAPITOL HILL
In short, had Washington committed another penalty, Hochuli could have quit creeping the ball toward the goal line. He would have just given the Eagles six points on the scoreboard.
Rule 12, Section 3, Article 4 does not exist in governance or politics. Except the voters, there is no referee like Shawn Hochuli to assess penalties, mete out discipline and dock a team yardage.
And this is what vexes Democrats – and some Republicans – when it comes toTrump Administrationmoves to freeze money appropriated by Congress across the board.
Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution makes delegation of spending powers very clear – which is a big reason why Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency is so controversial on Capitol Hill.(Anna Moneymaker)
Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution is clear about which branch of government controls the purse strings:""No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.""
In other words, Congress is responsible for spending money. The executive branch just cannot unilaterally thwart what Congress spends. President Richard Nixon tried this in the mid-1970s with ""impoundment."" Nixon’s administration blocked spending money which Congress allocated.
MUSK'S DOGE TAKES AIM AT 'VIPER'S NEST' FEDERAL AGENCY WITH GLOBAL FOOTPRINT
This is whyElon Musk’s""Department of Government Efficiency"" or ""DOGE"" is so controversial. First of all, it’s not a ""department"" like the State Department or the Department of Energy. It’s really the ""U.S. DOGE Service,"" positioned under the umbrella of a small agency within the executive branch: The U.S. Digital Service.
But President Trump has granted Elon Musk and his team access to probe ways to cut spending. The DOGE service can’t just cut spending on its own. At least not constitutionally. And it certainly can’t eliminate another agency, like the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID.
Unless Congress says so.
Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called the president's ""temporary"" pause on federal grants and loans ""normal practice"" for the fledgling second Trump administration.(Getty Images)
That’s why the drama last week about an automatic freeze on federal grants and loans rattled lawmakers from both parties onCapitol Hill. Granted, the administration called for a ""temporary"" pause. And even some powerful Republicans were okay with that.
""I think that's a normal practice at the beginning of administration until we have an opportunity to know how the money is being spent,"" said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., about the halt. ""I think it's just this is kind of a preliminary step that I think most administrations take.""
But Congress generally safeguards its prerogatives of spending very closely. It would be remarkable for lawmakers to fork over fiscal responsibilities to the executive branch without a fight.
THE POLITICAL FIRESTORM THAT'S ABOUT TO SINGE CAPITOL HILL
This is why when granting a restraining order to quash moves by the administration to usurp congressional authority over spending, U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan declared that there was potential for ""irreparable harm"" to federal agencies and that the administration’s actions could be ""catastrophic.""
Republicans raised few hackles about the administration’s decisions. But Democrats and their allies spelled out the gravity of the circumstances.
""This is a profound Constitutional issue,"" argued Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. ""What happened last night is the most direct assault on the authority of Congress, I believe in the history of the United States. It is blatantly unconstitutional. Article two does not give the executive the power to determine budgets or expenditures that powers vested in article three in the Congress.""

USAID shuttered Monday and staffers were locked out of the computer system. Musk said that the agency should be closed.
House and Senate Democrats marched down to USAID headquarters in Washington Monday to protest the move by DOGE and Musk.
""If you want to change an agency, introduce a bill and pass a law. You cannot wave away an agency that you don't like,"" said Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii.
""Just like Elon Musk did not create USAID, he doesn't have the power to destroy it,"" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. ""We don't have a fourth branch of government called Elon Musk.""

The moves by the administration last week and over the weekend to trample on congressional spending powers were so egregious that Democrats may have hoped that referee Shawn Hochuli was around to award them a score.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/experts-fear-chinas-deepseek-ai-econ-101-says-shouldnt-worry,‘Experts’ fear China’s DeepSeek AI. Econ 101 says they shouldn’t worry,"Fox News correspondent Christina Coleman reports on the impact of DeepSeek AI on U.S. tech stocks and reactions to the innovation on ‘Fox News @ Night.’
If you care about national security, artificial intelligence (AI) or the index funds in your retirement account, you have likely heard of DeepSeek.Chinese AI model DeepSeek’s releaselate January caused a $969 billion stock market selloff and prompted responses from AI leaders like President Donald Trump, NVIDIA, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.
DeepSeek is aChinese AI modelsimilar to those which run famous programs like ChatGPT. The difference? This one is reportedly 40-50 times cheaper to train, which some think implies we have invested 40-50 times too much in AI chips and infrastructure.
If panicked stock sellers and pessimists are to be believed, DeepSeek is some sort of kryptonite whose existence implies China will do to American AI what it did to American toy manufacturing.
THERE IS A 'WAKE-UP CALL' FOR US TO BE THE LEADER IN AI, SAYS WHITE HOUSE AI AND CRYPTO ‘CZAR’
This is nonsense. DeepSeek’s figures are bullish for American AI if true and bullish for American AI if false. Here’s why:
The furor over China's DeepSeek AI is overstated. But U.S. firms can't ignore it either.
And since when do lower costs and lower barriers to entry mean lower demand?
DeepSeek runs on the following layers:
China's DeepSeek AI relied on chips from NVIDIA, even though it's banned from export to China.(Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)
The physical chips used were NVIDIA H800s, a downgraded version of the popular H100 chip. Both have been banned by the U.S. for export to China, proving again that President Joe Biden’s export bans are useless and merely force China to become more innovative.
The other models used to train DeepSeek reflect the sustained need for massive compute and reliance on American models. Per Rand’s Lennart Heim,
""DeepSeek operated Asia's first 10,000 Nvidia A100 cluster, reportedly maintains 50,000 'Hoppers' (which could be Nvidia's H100, H800, or H20), and has additional unlimited access to Chinese and foreign cloud providers (which is not export-controlled). This extensive compute access was likely crucial for developing their efficiency techniques through trial and error and for serving their models to customers.""
In addition, there is mounting evidence that DeepSeek is a distillation (in essence a copy) of American AI leader OpenAI’s latest models. OpenAI says it is looking into this possibility.
This means that the remaining component, the final model brought to market, also would depend on American AI. On top of early incidental finds by AI developers independently investigating the matter, Microsoft has joined OpenAI in looking into the depth of DeepSeek’s alleged copying.
Even if China suddenly decided it likes telling the truth and DeepSeek did cost less than $6 million to train, it required indirect access to nearly a billion dollars of American compute. Analysis by SemiAnalysis suggests DeepSeek’s capital expenditure was closer to $1.6billion, with $944 million of this cost dedicated to the cost of compute. Hardly the garage band operation the headlines would suggest.
The $6M number is misleading by many orders of magnitude. And even if it wasn’t, DeepSeek would be no NVIDIA-pocalypse unless we thought all future models would be mere distillations of existing ones. DeepSeek is an affirmation of American AI leadership and a reminder that value lies in AI infrastructure and customer-facing products themselves, not in closed-source models.
In addition, there is mounting evidence that DeepSeek is a distillation (in essence a copy) of American AI leader OpenAI’s latest models. OpenAI says it is looking into this possibility.
As Andreessen said, this is AI’s Sputnik moment. America received a reminder that a rival is further ahead in a critical technology than we had previously thought, that innovations lead to lower barriers to entry and lower costs to catch up, and that we should not take our leadership for granted.
Here’s what Americans should take away:
Biden's AI restrictions were a failure and DeepSeek's reliance on U.S. tech proves it.(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)
This competition runs on open-source (publicly available) science. We do not have a technical moat and will win only through a continued emphasis on speed and quality. Export controls only work for high-complexity products with decades-long development cycles.
America’s AI industry is safe if it continues its momentum.

Others still depend directly and indirectly on American models and chips. It is beneficial to have our rivals depend on us. Resource deprivation breeds innovation and expansionism. Just ask Imperial Japan
Meanwhile, AI costs will come down for everyone. Computers and machine learning algorithms become cheaper over time, and there is no credible reason to bank on a ceiling or ""peak AI.""
America received a reminder that a rival is further ahead in a critical technology than we had previously thought, that innovations lead to lower barriers to entry and lower costs to catch up, and that we should not take our leadership for granted.
DeepSeek’s only clear innovations are aspects of its training methods, and we have the scale to make superior use of them if we have the will and humility to do so. If DeepSeek can derive a workable copy from a larger model for less than $6 million, imagine how this capability will compound and accelerate model development for companies like OpenAI and Google ready to deploy hundreds of millions of dollars.

In the words of Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, ""We need to make sure we set standards that the world meets. And I think that's the way we'll keep our lead. Do it the American way, which we know is the winning way.""
DeepSeek is a fire drill and a reminder to prepare for the real thing. In the meantime, we should heed the reminder that we can’t be complacent with our current leadership. Instead, we must do what we do best: focus on winning. We have a head start, the best scientists and chips in the world, and a president prepared to fight for American AI. We now must execute.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/musk-rips-fraudulent-treasury-payments-reports-mount-doge-has-access-federal-payment-system,Musk rips 'fraudulent' Treasury handouts as reports mount DOGE has access to federal payment system,"Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson has the latest on the Senate confirmation hearings for President-elect Trump’s Cabinet nominees on ‘Special Report.’
Tech billionaire Elon Muskripped alleged ""fraudulent"" Treasury payments on Saturday as reports circulated that the Department of Government Efficiency has gained acces to the federal government's payment system as the second Trump administration continues cutting what they say is government fat and overspending.
""The @DOGE team discovered, among other things, that payment approval officers at Treasury were instructed always to approve payments, even to known fraudulent or terrorist groups. They literally never denied a payment in their entire career. Not even once,"" Musk, the chair of DOGE, posted early Saturday morning to X.
Musk's post came just ahead of the New York Times reporting Saturday afternoon that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent granted DOGE personnel access to the payment system. The Treasury spends roughly $6 trillion per year on payments for federal agencies.
The ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, posted to social media on Saturday that he has also been informed that DOGE was granted access to the system.

""Sources tell my office that Treasury Secretary Bessent has granted DOGE *full* access to this system. Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies. All of it,"" Wyden posted to social media site BlueSky on Saturday evening.
DOGE's reported access to the payment system comes after the Washington Post reported on Friday that the former acting director of the Treasury, David A. Lebryk, was planning to exit the finance department of the federal government following a clash over granting DOGE access to its payment system. Lebryk oversaw the Treasury Department in the days betweenPresident Donald Trump's inaugurationon Jan. 20 and Bessent's confirmation to lead the department on Jan. 27.

On Friday, reports also spread that civil servants within the Office of Personnel Management, which works as the federal government's HR department, were reportedly locked from the office's computer systems by DOGE.
Musk quipped on X on Saturday that working over the weekend is a ""superpower,"" where the ""opposing team"" disappear for two days.
""Very few in the bureaucracy actually work the weekend, so it’s like the opposing team just leaves the field for 2 days! Working the weekend is a superpower,"" he posted.
‘DOGE’-MEETS-CONGRESS: GOP LAWMAKER AARON BEAN LAUNCHES CAUCUS TO HELP MUSK ‘TAKE ON CRAZYTOWN’
Trump officially created DOGE via an executive order signedon his first day in office. The EO outlines that government agency chiefs provide DOGE with access to internal government platforms such as, ""software systems, and IT systems.""
""Agency Heads shall take all necessary steps, in coordination with the USDS Administrator and to the maximum extent consistent with law, to ensure USDS has full and prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.  USDS shall adhere to rigorous data protection standards,"" the executive order reads.

Trump and Musk had long previewed the creation of DOGE while on the campaign trail, championing that the team would weed out overspending and fraud within the federal government. DOGE is not a government department, but instead operates as a team within the Trump administration.
Before Trump's win in November, Musk hosted the Republican president for an interview on X in August, where Musk railed against government overspending and inflation that has gripped the nation in recent years.

""A lot of people just don’t understand where inflation comes from. Inflation comes from government overspending because the checks never bounce when it’s written by the government. So if the government spends far more than it brings in, that increases the money supply. If the money supply increases faster than the rate ofgoods and services, that’s inflation,"" Musk said during their conversation.
MUSK RENEWS HARSH REBUKE OF DEMS WHO REJECTED DEPORTING SEX OFFENDERS: VOTE OUT ‘EVERY ONE’
""So really we need to reduce our government spending, and we need to re-examine… I think we need a government efficiency commission to say like, ‘Hey, where are we spending money that’s sensible. Where is it not sensible?’""
Since its official creation last month, DOGE's X account has provided updates on its work to cut government spending, including announcing last week that it has cut more than $1 billion from federal spending through now-defunct diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and personnel.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/gen-z-plans-micro-retirement-when-theyve-barely-started-working,Gen Z plans micro-retirement when they’ve barely started working,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Generation Z has now come up with another new term you’ll be hearing more about, it’s called ""micro-retirement."" The concept of ""micro-retirement"" is totake time from workwhile you are still young, rather than deferring all your future leisure plans to the later years of life.
Some people just call this being unemployed for a while. Others call it taking a sabbatical from work. This new trend is sweeping through Generation Z and are they on to something smart or is this going to create aneven more cratering financial effecton their financial future?
OK. I must make a confession. At 55 years old, it’s hard to get my head wrapped around needing a big ‘break from work’ in your 20s.
TRUMP'S ULTIMATUM TO FEDERAL WORKERS: RETURN TO OFFICE 'OR BE TERMINATED'
Brittney Foley, 26, is a woman who is opting for a micro-retirement. She explained that taking smaller career breaks earlier in your life is perfect when you don’t have kids as you can quite literally do whatever you want. This is assuming you can afford it. Although, with national credit card debt at a staggering $1.2 trillion and the average credit card balance soaring past $6,000, can Generation Z really afford it?
Some Gen Z workers have a different view of work, even pursuing the idea of micro-retirement.(Wealth of Geeks)
Brittney said, ""With other people my age, there’s so much pressure to chase promotion cycles and raises, andeveryone is so burnt out.""Burnt out? At 26?
This generation has decided to flip the script of how they view their own financial plan, which is live for today and don’t worry about tomorrow.
There is a much more cynical view from people in their 20s that they will be able to afford a home, retire comfortably and reap the benefits of Social Security. So, we are witnessing a counterculture of younger people turning the retirement script upside down with this idea of having three- to six-month breaks in between their next career move.
A very close friend of mine has a daughter who left Google recently at the age of 30. She had done very well there, rising through the ranks and building an income of almost $300,000. But, feeling the passion to live for today, she quit the job and is currently living for four months in Hawaii and then off to two months in Bali before she figures out her next career move. Is this something that Boomers and Gen Xers should have done when they were younger?
The phrase micro-retirement was first described in ""The 4-Hour Workweek,"" a self-help and careers guidance book published by the entrepreneur Tim Ferris in 2007.  However, most young people may not fully think about the financial consequences of these mini-retirement decisions.
Your 401k/retirement savings:For Gen Z workers, they need to look closely at the matching and profit-sharing contributions from their company. Often, these contributions made by the employer have a vesting schedule and it could be a horrific financial move to walk away from unvested money that could have a substantial impact on your retirement balances over the long haul.
Your ability to earn the same income … or more:The strategy of micro-retirement assumes you’ll be able to re-enter the workplace quickly and at the same income or more. Part of growing your income, bonuses and potentially company stock is often tied to your tenure with a company.
It’s unknown yet how employers will view someone who has two, three, or four breaks in their resume to micro-retire and whether they will want to hire that person knowing they could quit in a couple of years after the employer invested tons of time and money training that new employee.
This generation has decided to flip the script of how they view their own financial plan, which is live for today and don’t worry about tomorrow.
Your Social Security:While some Gen Z workers believe they will never see a dime of Social Security, it’s important to account for how a break in your income will affect your long-term Social Security. It’s likely the full retirement age for those in their 20s will be past the age of 67, but having gaps of income could make your overall Social Security lower down the road and impact your overall retirement.

Debt:What’s most worrisome aspect of this new trend is the debt that younger workers in America may take on to achieve a mini retirement. Most people in retirement aren’t jet-setting around the world and often these micro-retirement breaks are partnered with exotic vacations or luxury travel which could increase the debt load on younger people.
This new trend that emerged on TikTok sees Gen Z workers from around the world vowing to take periodic breaks from the office to protect their ""mental health"" — despite being several decades away from the retirement age.
On one hand, I’ve done financial plans for many people in their 40s and 50s who are seeking an early retirement to start to enjoy their hard-earned money and savings. However, many of those people often worry about running out of money, so they’ll extend the amount of time they work another five or 10 years to be sure they have enough retirement savings to do whatever they want to do in retirement. In some cases, health issues that arise like a bad knee or hip or something even more consequential may stop them from fully enjoying the assets that they have saved up.
You could say it’s irresponsible to not focus on saving and planning for your future to just enjoy every nickel and more that you have in the bank today.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
You are not only applying a much narrower window of achieving retirement success with micro-retirement, but it could also cost America billions of dollars to take care of people who didn’t save because they wanted to spend their money today. Are you ready to bail out people for their future retirement like people got bailed out for college loans?
So, who has it right? Those of us that toil away, max out our 401(k), pay down our house quicker and save that bucket list for when we retire? Or does Gen Z have it right with the attitude that tomorrow is never promised, who knows when we will have a COVID-19 like event again? You should just sit back, assume you’ll work forever, and soak up as much fun as you can when you are in your 20s and 30s? Time will tell if this is another fad, or it will become a staple of how people live in the future.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/craig-t-nelson-grew-up-farm-family-new-film-celebrates-americans-who-really-do-work-food,CRAIG T. NELSON: I grew up in a farm family. My new film celebrates Americans who really do work for food,"Craig T. Nelson explains what drew him to his new movie, ""Green and Gold,"" specifically the story that he felt connected to.
When I think of the farmers I grew up around, I think of resilience and stewardship. These are people who rise before the sun, work tirelessly to feed not only their families but all of us and endure hardships most of us cannot imagine. Yet the headlines about America’s farming recession remind us of just how much they shoulder — and how little recognition they often receive.
As an actor, recognition finds you whether you want it or not. While the work is meaningful, it can pale compared to the daily hours, grit and commitment farming families dedicate daily. There is no craft services table waiting for them — they are feeding everyone else.
Farming is not just a job— it is a calling.Theirs is often an unnoticed sacrifice, from the long hours and rising costs to the unpredictable weather and policy challenges. A single bag of corn seed now costs $230, nearly double the price of a few years ago. Combine that with declining crop prices, and farmers must navigate a system stacked against them. Yet they persevere because their work feeds millions and sustains communities.
KELSEY GRAMMER SAYS CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IS LOOKING ‘MORE ATTRACTIVE’ TO HOLLYWOOD
My great-grandfather, Gulbrand Nelson, left Norway to settle in Wisconsin before moving to South Dakota, whereour family farm still standstoday. That upbringing instilled in me the importance of values, tradition and faith — ideals I see fading as time passes. If we let them fade long enough, they will vanish.
Actor Craig T. Nelson stars in the new film ""Green and Gold."" Nelson grew up in a farming family and knows how important feeding America really is.
I’ve been blessed in my career with the ability to do things I believe in. At this stage in my life, it has become all the more important to work on projects that matter to me and the legacy I will leave to my children, grandchildren and those who have entrusted me with their viewing time over the years.
My family's heritage inspired me to take on one such projectcalled ""Green and Gold,""a film that reflects the spirit of farming families and their struggles today. The project embodies what I value most: resilience, stewardship, and legacy. It is a tribute to the farmers who quietly hold our country together.
Growing up near farming communities, I saw firsthand what that perseverance looks like: long days in the fields, families working through mechanical failures or harsh weather, and a deep-rooted pride in their labor. Those experiences shaped my values and the stories I want to tell.
When I was offered the opportunity to be part of ""Green and Gold,"" I knew it was more than a role — it was a chance to honor the legacy of farming families. The film highlights their resilience and quiet strength, reminding us of their vital contributions to our country.
Farmers are America's backbone. Their stewardship of the land reflects faith, responsibility and commitment to something greater than themselves. Yet, they are often left to face economic and policy challenges alone. This farming recession is not just a farming issue but a national one. Rural communities are struggling, and the ripple effects will touch us all. We must do more than recognize farmers in times of crisis. We must advocate for policies that support them, invest in rural infrastructure, and champion their contributions to our everyday lives.

Beyond the economic struggles, farming takes an emotional toll. In conversations with farmers, while preparing for ""Green and Gold,"" I heard pride in their work and concern about the future. Who will carry on their legacy? Will their children want to inherit the struggles that come with it? These are not just questions — they are the realities shaping rural America today.
We owe so much to our farmers. They feed us, clothe us and sustain our economy. Their work is woven into the fabric of our history, yet their voices are often absent from national conversations. By telling their stories — on screen and off — we can honor their contributions and address their challenges.
My great-grandfather, Gulbrand Nelson, left Norway to settle in Wisconsin before moving to South Dakota, where our family farm still stands today.
Take a moment to reflect on the farmers behind the meals you eat and the clothes you wear. Support your local farmers’ markets, advocate for policies that uplift them, and express gratitude for their tireless work.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/3-reasons-why-elon-musk-wants-get-rid-penny,3 reasons why Elon Musk wants to get rid of the penny,"Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss progressive groups suing D.O.G.E. and Trump's Cabinet confirmation hearings continuing after the inauguration.
Elon Musk, the billionaire part entrepreneur and part Cabinet member known for his groundbreaking and disruptive innovations, including Tesla, SpaceX and Neuralink, has recently been vocal about his belief that the U.S. shouldeliminate the penny.
While he is not the first person to advocate for this change, Musk's influence and outspoken nature have brought renewed attention to the debate over whether the penny still has a place in the modern economy.
The argument forgetting rid of the pennyis not new. Economists, policymakers and financial experts have long debated its practicality. The last time I can remember using a penny was in the convenience store with a ‘give a penny, take a penny’ dish.

Here why Musk will be the ultimate impetus in removing the penny (and maybe other coins) from our daily lives.
OUR COUNTRY NEEDS A TURNAROUND STORY TO SAVE ITSELF. ELON, VIVEK AND DOGE CAN RESTORE OUR SANITY
One of the most compelling reasons to eliminate the penny is that it costs more to produce than its face value. According to the U.S. Mint, it costs about 2.7 cents to manufacture a single penny.Talk about DOGE!
This means that taxpayers are effectively losing money every time a new penny is minted. The U.S. government spendshundreds of millions of dollarsproducing pennies that are hardly used in daily transactions. DOGE said on X that in 2023 the number was 179 million.
Musk, who has built his career on optimizing efficiency – whether in electric vehicles, space travel or AI – sees this as an obvious waste of resources. And you know what, he’s right!
A PERFECT FIRST WEEK FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP (WITH AN ASTERISK)
This is about a new government of common sense. From a business perspective, it makes little sense to continue producing an item that costs more than it's worth.
Aside from production costs, pennies slow down transactions. Whether at a cash register, a vending machine or a toll booth, handling pennies takes up time. Businesses and consumers alike waste countless hours each year counting and dealing with these low-value coins.
By removing anearly worthless denomination, cash transactions could move faster, benefiting both businesses and customers. Most people thought checks would be obsolete at this point, but people still use them. But for sure, most people know that pennies have no place in our daily lives.
TRUMP’S BORDER SURGE IS WORKING. HERE ARE 5 THINGS LIKELY TO HAPPEN NEXT
When the penny was first introduced in 1793, it had significant purchasing power. Today, it buys almost nothing.Inflation has erodedthe penny’s value to the point where many people refuse to pick one up off the ground.

In an era where digital payments and credit cards dominate, the penny’s role in everyday commerce has dwindled. There’s a reason that Dollar Tree hardly has anything that costs a dollar anymore.
Society is evolving with technological advancements and many forms of digital payments. Most people use credit cards, debit cards, Venmo, Zelle, PayPal, and possibly cryptocurrency in the future.
What can you really buy for a penny anymore? When I was 20 years old, it was 12 CDs from Columbia House. Not anymore.
REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS MUST IMMEDIATELY ADVANCE TRUMP'S MAGA AGENDA
Why is Musk the leader to make this change? For one, his opinions carry weight, socially and politically. As the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink and other ventures, he has a massive following. When he speaks out on an issue – even one as seemingly minor as eliminating the penny – people pay attention.

Musk has used social media, particularly X (formerly Twitter), to express his thoughts on various economic and financial topics. His influence could help push policymakers to seriously consider eliminating the penny, especially if he continues to highlight its inefficiency.
However, not everyone agrees with Musk. Some Americans have a sentimental attachment to the penny, particularly because of its historical significance and association with President Abraham Lincoln. Others worry that eliminating the penny could lead to retailers rounding prices up rather than down, effectively raising costs for consumers.
If the U.S. were to follow Musk’s suggestion and get rid of the penny, several changes would occur:
CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION
Rounding Transactions:Prices would likely be rounded to the nearest five cents. Studies from other countriessuch as Canada, which eliminated its penny in 2013, have shown that this rounding tends to balance out, meaning consumers don’t lose out significantly.
Reduced Production Costs:The government could save millions of dollars each year by halting penny production.
Faster Transactions:Cash purchases would be quicker without the need to count and distribute pennies.

Elon Musk’s callto eliminate the penny is rooted in logic, efficiency and financial pragmatism. While the penny once served a meaningful purpose, inflation and technological progress have made it largely irrelevant.
Whether policymakers will act on this issue remains to be seen, but Musk’s influence has reignited the conversation about whether it’s time for the penny to become a thing of the past.

Costco shoppers shared their opinions about the company’s ""commitment"" to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies in the wake of many other retailers scaling back their DEI efforts.
""Baloney, to be honest with you. I think they should get rid of it,"" Robert of Madison Heights, Michigan, told Fox News Digital. ""Puts people in there that aren't qualified to do this, to do the job that they're hired for.""
Shoppers in Michigan, Texas and New York spoke withFox News Digitalwhile they were shopping or pumping gas at the retail store.
Several customers shared similar sentiments as Robert, evoking the term ""merit"" when prompted to respond to whetherDEI has valid implications.

""I think it should be merit based,"" said Laura, a Texas resident.
Costco shareholders voted earlier this month toreject an anti-DEIproposal brought by activist shareholder group National Center for Public Policy Research.
While Costco is standing firm behind its DEI policies, many other corporations have announced plans to ditch the controversial programsfollowing a nationwide backlash. Facebook, McDonald’s, Walmart, Harley-Davidson and many other companies have all rolled back their DEI programs in recent months.
Costco is bucking the trend and appears to have the support of some of their customers.

While pumping gas at a Costco in Madison Heights, a patron was asked whether Costco should care more about hiring practices with DEI objectives or lowering grocery prices.
""I would say DEI because the person is more important,"" Carol said.
She added that she does not agree with President Donald Trump’s position to get rid of DEI policies in the federal government.
However, a patron in Harlem told Fox News Digital that the retailer should care more about the price of groceries.
""The price of groceries. Yeah. Too much. Too much. Are you kidding me? I mean, I'm working. I have a little pension, and I still can't make ends meet,"" the shopper said.

PresidentDonald Trumpsaid Wednesday that federal employees must return to in-person work by early February or ""be terminated,"" the latest in a string of actions announced by the new administration as it looks to crack down on remote work.
Trump addressed the changes Wednesday at the White House shortly before signing into law the immigration-focused Laken Riley bill.
Asked about the new requirements for federal workers, Trump said, ""We’re requiring them to show up to work or be terminated.""
WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT DOGE AND ITS QUEST TO SLASH GOVERNMENT WASTE, SPENDING
His remarks come just hours after the Office of Personnel Management, or OPM, began emailing roughly 2 million federal employees on Tuesday, offering them the equivalent of a buyout if they do not return to in-person work within a specified time frame.
Employees have until Feb. 6 to decide whether to take the buyouts, OPM said, noting that most employees will be required to show up in person five days a week.
Those who choose not tocontinue their roles in personwould be provided with what the email said would be a ""dignified, fair departure from the federal government utilizing a deferred resignation program.""

Employees who resign were also told they will retain all pay and benefits regardless of workload and will be exempt from in-person work requirements until Sep. 30, 2025.
""We think a very substantial number of people will not show up to work, and, therefore, our government will get smaller and more efficient,"" Trump told reporters of the plan Wednesday. ""And that's what we've been looking to do for many, many decades.""

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-kaine-claims-trump-stiff-federal-employees-who-take-buyout-offer-do-not-fooled,Sen. Kaine claims Trump will 'stiff' federal employees who take buyout offer: 'Do not be fooled',"Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., says federal workers should 'not be fooled' by Trump administration's buyout offers.
Sen. Tim Kaine is claiming that PresidentDonald Trumpis going to ""stiff"" federal employees who accept buyout offers instead of returning to the office, telling workers ""Do not be fooled by this guy.""
The Trump administration is offering buyouts for nearly all federal employees, including those who work remotely, as part of the president’s efforts to get employees back into the office, but they only have until Feb. 6 to opt-in. However, Kaine argued on the Senate floor Tuesday night that Trump has no such grounds to make that kind of deal.
""The federal employees received an interesting email at the end of the day today.... that said, from the administration, if you tender your resignation by next Friday, we will guarantee you payment through the end of September whether or not you show up for work. So tender your resignation and then boy, it’s just going to be a gravy train, you are just going to get paid for seven months without working,"" Kaine said.
""The president has no authority to make that offer. There’s no budget line item to pay people who are not showing up for work. This is a guy who made this promise to contractors again and again and again when he was a private business guy. ‘Oh, come work for me on my casino.’ ‘Come work for me in a hotel.’ ‘We’re going to do a handshake. We’re going to do a contract.’ The contractor does the work and then finds out they get stiffed,"" Kaine continued.

""So my message to federal employees who receive this is, yeah, the president has tried to terrorize you for about a week and then gives you a little sweetheart offer: ‘If you resign in the next week, we’re just going to pay you for doing nothing for the next seven months.’ Don’t be fooled. He’s tricked hundreds of people with that offer. If you accept that offer and resign, he’ll stiff you just like he stiffed the contractors. He doesn’t have any authority to do this. Do not be fooled by this guy,"" the Virginia Democrat also said.
When asked to respond Wednesday, theWhite Housereferred Fox News Digital to a statement by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in which she said ""After four years of incompetence and failure, President Donald Trump is committed to making our government efficient and productive again.
""American taxpayers pay for the salaries of federal government employees and therefore deserve employees working on their behalf who actually show up to work in our wonderful federal buildings, also paid for by taxpayers,"" Leavitt added Tuesday.

""That’s absolutely false. This is a suggestion to federal workers that they have to return to work. And if they don’t, then they have the option to resign. And this administration is very generously offering to pay them for eight months,"" she said.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-mock-trumps-handling-cost-living-crisis-days-presidency,"Leavitt says egg shortage, grocery prices why Senate must 'move swiftly' to confirm Trump nominees","White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that the high prices of eggs is directly related to a lack of chicken supply which the Biden administration contributed to.
PresidentDonald Trump’sWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt urged members of Congress to confirm Trump's nominees to address problems like the U.S. egg shortage and the cost of living crisis.
""This is an example of why it's so incredibly important that the Senate moves swiftly to confirm all of President Trump's nominees, including his nominee for the United States Department of Agriculture, Brooke Rollins, who is already speaking with Kevin Hassett, who's leading the economic team here at the White House, on how we can address the egg shortage in this country,"" Leavitt told reporters Tuesday ather first White House press briefing.
""We also have seen the cost of everything, not just eggs, bacon, groceries, gasoline, have increased because of the inflationary policies of the last administration,"" Leavitt said.

Leavitt's comments came directly after Democrats took several jabs atTrump’shandling of the cost of living crisis just days after his inauguration, citing rising prices for eggs amid larger conversations about the price of groceries and cost of living as a whole.
While the consumer price index shows consumerprices increased roughly 20%under former President Joe Biden’s administration, Democrats remain skeptical that Trump’s economic proposals will prove effective.
""The price of eggs and the cost of living was supposed to go down. Not up,"" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.,said in a post on Xon Friday.
SHELLING OUT: EGG PRICES RISE NEARLY 37 PERCENT

""Trump’s ‘concepts of a plan’ at work,"" Suhas Subramanyam, D-Va.,said in a post on Xon Friday, pointing to a photo claiming a dozen eggs cost nearly $9. It’s unclear where the photo originated or its authenticity.
Subramanyam’s post referenced Trump’s comments that he had ""concepts of a plan"" to replace the Affordable Care Act, during a September 2024 presidential debate with former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Meanwhile, the consumer price index showsegg prices have soared nearly 37%in the past year. For example, a dozen Grade A large eggs cost an average of $4.15 in December — up from $2.51 in December 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
In some states like California, those numbers have gone up to nearly $9 per dozen in certain areas. California, like other states including Arizona, Massachusetts and Michigan, requires all eggs sold in the state to come from cage-free hens, which typically are more expensive.
The rise in egg prices comes amid high demand and a massive outbreak of avian flu, known as the highly pathogenic avian influenza, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture attributes to killing more than 20 million egg-laying hens in the last quarter of 2024. All birds from an infected flock are culled, exacerbating the impact of the flu.
Leavitt on Tuesday blamed this killing policy for contributing to the egg shortage.
""The Biden Administration’s slow and ineffective response to the avian influenza outbreak, which began in 2022, has negatively impacted U.S. poultry producers, and his USDA forced farmers to massively cut their livestock populations,"" Anna Kelly, White House deputy press secretary, said in a Monday statement to Fox News Digital.
As a result, Kelly said Trump and Rollins would take ""bold, decisive action"" to address problems related to the avian flu, and direct the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to refocus on the health of animals and plants.
Democrats previously have questioned Trump’s ability to reduce grocery prices, and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., said in early January that ""Trump has no idea"" how to cut down such prices.

Among those orders was a directive instructing every department and agency to address the cost of living crisis.

The state of the economy ranked as the top issue in the 2024 election, according to aGallup poll conducted in September 2024.

Leavitt also defended the Trump administration’s decision toissue a freeze on federal grants and loans on Monday— a move that prompted backlash from Democrats. Leavitt issued reassurance that those who receive individual federal assistance will not be impacted by the pause.
""I have now been asked and answered this question four times,"" Leavitt said. ""To individuals at home who receive direct assistance from the federal government: You will not be impacted by this federal freeze.""
Programs including Social Security benefits, Medicare, food stamps, welfare benefits and other assistance going directly to individuals will still continue under the pause, according to Leavitt. However, she said she would ""check back"" regarding the status of Medicaid.

Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., claim the decision is an overreach of power and said it is an attempt to circumvent Congress and withhold congressionally approved funds.
""More lawlessness and chaos in America as Donald Trump’s Administration blatantly disobeys the law by holding up virtually all vital funds that support programs in every community across the country,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""If this continues, the American people will pay an awful price.""
""They say this is only temporary, but no one should believe that,"" Schumer said. ""Donald Trump must direct his Administration to reverse course immediately and the taxpayers’ money should be distributed to the people.""
Leavitt also unveiled major changes to White House press access, and announced that theTrump administration would restore the presspasses for 440 journalists whose passes she said ""were wrongly revoked"" by the Biden administration.
""In keeping with this revolutionary media approach that President Trump deployed during the campaign, the Trump White House will speak to all media outlets and personalities, not just the legacy media who are seated in this room,"" Leavitt said.

Gov. Ron DeSantis recently called for a series of proposals to help implement President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. However, Florida lawmakers opted to hold their own legislative session,overriding bills DeSantis wanted to pass.
The governor’s bills included mandating that Florida's counties and cities participate in the federal deportation program, wanting the power to suspend officials who do not comply and making it a state crime to enter the nation illegally, among other measures.

Prior to the election,Americans around the countryspoke about what they hoped to see for another Trump term, many citing the economy and inflation as the main priorities they hoped the president would tackle.
In addition to closing the borders and immigration reform, a high point of interest for residents of one of the state’s largest 55+ communities was also the economy, alongside drilling for natural resources and ""fixing all the problems the last four years have caused.""
The Villages is often looked at as a strong city of support for the MAGA movement and support for Trump, due to common interests like ""getting the country back to where it should be,"" which often include immigration reform, and the shared mindsets of retirees.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-written-dei-government-death-sentence-school-policies-should-next,Trump's written a DEI government death sentence. School policies should be next,"Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy gives an update on President Donald Trump's crackdown on federal diversity, equity, and inclusion offices on 'The Will Cain Show.'
DEI is in decline. On his first day in office, President Donald Trump signed an executiveorder to end""radical and wasteful government DEI programs"" in federal agencies.
Trump made the right call. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. said he dreamed people would ""not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."" DEI ideology is a slap in the face to MLK Jr.’s civil rights agenda to treat everyone equally, regardless of the color of their skin.
The good news is Trump isn’t the only leader launching afull-frontal assault on DEI programs.
FLORIDA EDUCATORS FILE FEDERAL LAWSUIT CHALLENGING STATE LAW UPENDING DEI POLICIES
Governor Greg Abbott reminded everyone this month that Texas""banned DEI in higher educationand cut funding for any DEI positions"" last session. He also just announced on X that Texas ""will ban DEI in K-12 grades & cut funding"" this year. Republican legislators are already filing bills to do so this session.
DEI undermines education and institutionalizes Marxist indoctrination.(iStock)
You can’t argue with that idea: if DEI programs are too divisive for adult college students, why are these initiatives allowed to indoctrinate young children in primary and secondary public schools?
Shouldn’t this destructive ideology have been banned in schools with young impressionable minds before it was banned in colleges with adult students?
That chronology would have made sense if political decisions were a reflection of logic rather than power. But special interests have a stranglehold on K-12, unlike any other industry or level of education. The largest labor union in the country is the teachers union, and they fight to maintain their monopoly over the public school system.
DEI programs give these special interests another reason to hire more useless bureaucrats and increase revenue from additional dues-paying members. The DEI jobs program in the public school system benefits union bosses who funnel those dollars toward enriching themselves and getting more of their Democrat buddies in office.
This DEI grift that wastes our tax dollars on worthless administrative positions alsogives teachers unions –and, by extension, the Democratic Party – a larger voting bloc to push for more of their left-wing political pet projects.
It’s no surprise the teachers union lobbies in favor of DEI in schools.
The Marxist ideology infiltrating our public schools that divides people based on their immutable characteristics – under the guise of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) – would be better described as Divisive Educational Indoctrination.
Texas Representative Brian Harrison, a Republican, told us in a statement that he is ""sick of Texas taxpayers having their hard-earned money weaponized against them, their values, and their children by being forced to fund liberal indoctrination in our public schools.""
Shouldn’t this destructive ideology have been banned in schools with young impressionable minds before it was banned in colleges with adult students?
Harrison said, ""It’s long past time for the Texas legislature to finally rip DEI, root and branch, out of the public school system.""
DEI is now in retreat thanks to elected officials listening to common sense. But top-down regulations on the public school system are not sufficient to keep this harmful ideology at bay.
In January, undercover journalists at Accuracy in Media exposed the executive director of DEI at a Texas school district for saying biological boys could room with girls on overnight school trips on a ""case-by-case"" basis. Our team also exposed an administrator in Dallas ISD for admitting on video that they can find ""loopholes"" to the Texas law protecting girls’ sports.

Accuracy in Media additionally exposed Texas public school administrators for admitting on video to undercover journalists that employees similarly circumvent the state law prohibiting Critical Race Theory (CRT) in classrooms.
It is incumbent upon state lawmakers to do what they can to tweak the public school system so that it is more accountable to families. But bans are not sufficient to protect kids from divisive ideologies such as CRT and DEI when the employees in the system can find loopholes and evade the law. It can be a never-ending game of whack-a-mole, especially for parents who usually don’t have video evidence of what really happens behind classroom doors.
The public-school monopoly needs to feel the pressure from both sides – from the state and the family – for it to start focusing on education rather than indoctrination.

DEI is now in retreat thanks to elected officials listening to common sense. But top-down regulations on the public school system are not sufficient to keep this harmful ideology at bay.
Parents who suspect their kids are being brainwashed with ideologies that conflict with their values should be able to vote with their feet for schools that better meet their needs. That would incentivize the public school system to keep all families happy – regardless of their political background – by focusing on the basics.
The teachers unions won’t be happy about having to compete, but that’s just too bad. The school system wasn’t built for them. It exists to serve children and their families, not the other way around.

President Donald Trumpfloated moving nearly 90,000 IRS agents hired under the Biden administration to the border to patrol the area while armed with guns.
""On day one, I immediately halted the hiring of any new IRS agents. They hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 new workers to go after you. And we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them or maybe we'll move them to the border. And I think we're going to move them to the border,"" Trump said during a rally at Circa Resort & Casino in Las Vegas on Saturday evening.
""Where they're allowed to carry guns, you know, they're so strong on guns, but these people are allowed to carry guns, so we'll probably move them to the border,"" he continued. Certain special IRS agents are permitted to carry firearms as part of their duties, according to IRS Code, 26 U.S. Code § 7608.

While floating moving the thousands of IRS agents to the border, Trump also suggested ending income tax across the board, saying his plans on tariffs could fill the financial gaps.
""How about just no tax,"" he said to cheers, while he chuckled. ""You could do that. You know if the tariffs work out like I think, a thing like that could happen, if you want to know the truth.""

""Years ago, 1870 to 1913, we didn't have an income tax. We had, what we had is tariffs, where foreign countries came in and they stole our jobs, they stole our companies, they stole our product. They ripped us off. And, you know, they used to do numbers. And then we wentto tariff, a tariff system.And the tariff system made so much money. It was when we were the richest from 1870 to 1930. Then we came in with the – brilliantly came in – with an income tax,"" he continued, explaining the Great Depression rocked the U.S. shortly after moving away from the tariff system of the 1800s and early 1900s.

https://www.foxnews.com/media/trumps-ai-declaration-reminiscent-jfk-pledge-put-man-moon-former-white-house-official,Trump's AI 'declaration' reminiscent of JFK pledge to put a man on the moon: Former White House IT official,"Theresa Payton, the first female Chief Information Officer for the White House during the Bush administration, says Trump’s AI push could have enormous economic impact if the right guidelines are set.
President Donald Trump'srecent AI announcementhas the potential to jumpstart a technological ""renaissance"" in the United States and serve as a strong declaration, similar to former President John F. Kennedy's pledge to put a man on the moon, according to a top former White House information technology (IT) official.
During a speech at the White House, Trump announced that Softbank, OpenAI and Oracle have joined forces for Stargate, a project to build data centers in the U.S. for powering AI. The initial investment for the project will be $100 billion, with plans to expand to $500 billion over the next four years. The first data center built under the initiative will be in Texas, and it will eventually expand to other states.
Speaking withFox News Digital,Theresa Payton, the first female White House Chief Information Officer during President George W. Bush's administration, says the news, which Trump calls the ""largest AI infrastructure project, by far, in history,"" has her attention.

""I do really believe that very much like when you read in the history books about how President Kennedy said, we're going to put a man on the moon. This is one of those big declarations that's so important to the future of America. This has the potential to be sort of the beacon of America's technological progress. And I really think our true success, though, is going to hinge on what goes behind the big headline,"" she said.
To ensure success and a U.S. lead in AI, Payton says the project should set a ""gold standard"" for the rest of the world regarding responsible innovation, considering safety, security, individual rights, and privacy.
The first data center built under the initiative will be in Texas, eventually expanding to other states. The Trump administration claims that the venture could create 100,000 new jobs.
Payton told Fox News Digital that the people involved in the project have been through several technology innovation changes and have had to reimagine their companies and the skillsets needed to thrive—with the potential to offer firsthand knowledge on what is needed to mitigateworkforce displacement.

""If you think about the typing pools of the past and how they were replaced by word processing if you think about manufacturing jobs that were replaced by robotics and machinery, we need to be thinking about that upfront and showing people who are in jobs impacted. You can be retrained, you can be upskilled, things can be retooled. And I do believe it will create sort of the next technology renaissance,"" she said.
Payton believes that Trump's foray into AI infrastructure can have great economic impacts if the United States ""dreams"" the project upfront and sets the proper requirements.
The project represents a growing entanglement between Trump and Big Tech leaders, a relationship that has some critics worried. On Monday, CNN referred to Trump's return to the White House as the ""inauguration of the oligarchs.""
President Biden warned in his farewell speech of an""ultra-wealthy"" ""oligarchy""posing a threat to America as big tech CEOs were warming up to then President-elect Trump in recent months.
However, Payton says that how Trump handles these relationships will be the true test of their success or failure.

""There are career government employees, there are private sector companies. There are different industry sectors. And each one of them plays a role in making our economy strong and improving our national security. And, you know, I think you could probably say about every president, they bring with them a set of relationships. And so, the key is really just understanding how are those relationships utilized in a way that benefits the United States and, you know, kind of let the results and the deliverables be, the proof of, you know, how those relationships are being leveraged,"" she said.
Payton also noted that the Trump administration's transparency will be key to the success of AI, infrastructure and energy projects in the U.S.
This week, Trump live-streamedthe signing of executive orders,calling out loud what they are as he held them up and letting reporters ask questions. She suggested that level of transparency on large administration projects would be ""incredible.""

However, her greatest fear is that short-term deliverables regarding massive spending and big strategic projects will not be announced or met.
""I saw this when I worked in financial services, and you can see it in government projects is what are the deliverables in 30, 60, 90 days. So that, to me, hopefully, they're going to start releasing an approach that shows you sort of 90-day sprints over the next year, over the next two years for the Stargate project, so that we actually see kind of how the money is being spent, the successes and keep people sort of behind the success, rooting, cheering for it, but also that level of transparency that's going to be needed,"" she added.
Payton also stressed that the computers from large datacenters must be properly appropriated and designated for important causes and not frivolously overspent on low-level AI tasks.

On Monday,Donald Trumpmade history.
Then, he immediately made policy, issuing plenty of strong executive orders to begin reforming our government and enforcing our laws subverted by the Biden administration. Republicans in Congress must do our part to support President Trump by sending a constant supply of solidly conservative legislation to be signed into law at his desk.
During the election,President Trumpmade several key promises to the American people. Fortunately, Congress stands ready to deliver on these promises immediately.

With President Trump’s leadership, we will secure our southern border, swiftly deport illegal aliens, prosecute vile criminals, and end the tyranny of unelected bureaucrats. We will bring opportunity to the hardworking families of America and achieve prosperity for the nation.
DONALD TRUMP IS OUR PRESIDENT AND DEMOCRATS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO DO
To start repairing the gravedamage inflicted by Joe Biden, Congress should pass the SAVE Act. Doing so would prevent illegal, non-citizen voting by requiring ID to register to vote and cast ballots in federal elections. Congress should also pass the VALID Act, which forbids the Department of Homeland Security from admitting illegals and shuttling them around the country using the CBP One app.
The America First Act – which forbids giving federal benefits to illegals that the Biden administration let into our country – should also be a top priority. And of course, we must provide resources for additional border security, Border Patrol and ICE agents, and logistical operations to return millions of undocumented foreign nationals to their home countries.
Perhaps an even bigger task than building walls and battling cartels will be permanently uprooting the rogue federal employees who have become accustomed to running the government fromwithin the deep state.
TRUMP’S (SECOND) FIRST 100 DAYS GIVES DEMOCRATS OPPORTUNITIES
The REINS Act was crafted precisely to take control from unelected bureaucrats and return it to the people via their elected representatives. It requires that lawmaking be done by lawmakers as Article I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution mandates, preventing agencies from foisting expensive and destructive regulations upon the American people.
Addressing the affordability crisis for American families will require more than stopping expensive regulations. We need to let Americans keep more of their own money and invest it back into businesses and jobs by reauthorizing one of President Trump’s original policy victories, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
We should also tackle the hidden tax hitting everyone’s wallets –inflation. This means that legislators will face the single hardest decision in Washington politics: to say ""no"" when confronted with problematic, omnibus spending bills written in secret and not subjected to adequate debate and discussion.

The clock is ticking. Ourrazor-thin majority in the Houseof Representatives is guaranteed for only two years, and it’s an unfortunate reality that the second year will be full of recesses for members to campaign for re-election. That means even less time for legislating.
We cannot afford to repeat 2018, when Democrats took the House and crippled our ability to pass President Trump’s legislative agenda during the second half of his term. Republicans must act quickly.
Fortunately, our leadership seems to have the sense of urgency it lacked eight years ago.

Technology matters. For a century, Britain led the world based on innovations in coal and steam power. For a second century,America led the worldbased on electrification, materials science and mass production.
And now,with AI promisingto both boost the economy and bolster national security, America has a chance to lead in the century ahead. However, with China ramping up its investment in AI, pouring billions into data centers and integrating AI across its economy, we cannot take the outcome for granted.
And China’s investments in the technology sector as a whole are clearly paying off. A recent expert report reveals that America has lost its lead in most key technologies to its rival. From 2003-2007, China led in just three of 64 technologies, but now leads in 57. And while the U.S. led in 60 of 64 technologies, we now lead in just 7.

WILL YOUR JOB SURVIVE TRUMP’S GEN AI REVOLUTION?
Meanwhile, America’s leadership in AI, while narrow, has the potential to right the scales and capitalize on an enormous opportunity: McKinsey estimates that AI could add up to $22.1 trillion annually to the global economy—almost as much as the entire U.S. economy today.
What’s needed is an American pro-innovation AI agenda that promotes scientific leadership and turns breakthrough innovations in AI and quantum computing into practical tools with widespread benefit.
The ABC’s of Securing America’s AI Leadership
The good news in an era of tight budgets is thatAI is largely being fundedand developed by America’s private sector, which invests hundreds of billions in research and development annually. Led by tech, the top 25 American companies invested more than $328 billion in America in 2023.
TRUMP NAMES SEVERAL NEW WHITE HOUSE PICKS TO WORK ON AI, CRYPTO AND MORE: 'AMERICA FIRST PATRIOTS'
That commitment to investing in our future is only going to ramp up, but we need constructive government policies to complement private-sector development of cutting-edge algorithms, world-leading computation (chips and data centers, and the energy to power them), digital infrastructure, and undersea cables.
The Trump administration has an opportunity to accelerate progress by setting an agenda that’s aligned, balanced and competitive.
We need to avoid a patchwork of inconsistent laws—whether among U.S. states or between democratic allies—that will slow progress on AI innovation.
Comparing America and Europe shows the toll taken by over-regulation. A recent report from Mario Draghi, former Italian prime minister and EU Central Bank head, blamesEurope’s complex regulatory environmentfor slowing down tech progress and creating ""a vicious circle of low investment and low innovation.""
BIDEN ISSUES SECOND AI ACTION DURING FINAL WEEK IN OFFICE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER FAST-TRACKING US INFRASTRUCTURE
By contrast, American lawmakers set us on a path for success in the 1990s by striking down statutes that would have chilled speech or stymied the growth of the internet, enacting policies like the Internet Tax Freedom Act that helped nurture American startups, and encouraging an innovative and dynamic private sector.
That approach is one reason why on a per-person basis, American economic output is now about 40% higher than in Western Europe and Canada, and 60% higher than in Japan.
In short, streamlining and aligning rules delivers results.
AI has risks of abuse, but it also has tremendous potential. Thenew administration’s approachcan promote not just innovation, but deployment of these remarkable technologies.
Ideas are easy; execution is hard. Which is why we need to do more than just invest in the world’s best AI; we need to put it to work.

Streamlined federal procurement can make the government a leader, encouraging enterprises and institutions to adopt AI.

Competitivenessrequires not only promoting our innovation, but also not shooting ourselves in the foot with measures that would force the disclosure of American data and intellectual property to foreign actors or chill investment incutting-edge AI technologies.
Sometimes the biggest challenges require the biggest efforts to overcome. With so much at stake, we should be doubling down on today’s versions of Bell Labs or Xerox PARC as key strategic assets.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/updated-will-heres-why-should-too,"I updated my will. Here’s why you should, too","Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
The saying goes that a cobbler’s kids have no shoes. But my own experience in creating an estate and legacy planning product after thepassing of my fatherover a decade ago has ensured that I practice what I preach.
Given that I know how important formalizing my wishes and information is, I recently updated my own estate plan. Here’s why you should update yours, too — or get on it if you haven’t already put one in place.
Whether you are asset-heavy or asset-light, have many dependents or none, or have complex or simple affairs, putting an estate plan together is critical to make sure your wishes are carried out and that your loved ones aren’t overwhelmed by the process. Being organized now helps save yourloved ones’ time, money and griefwhen they need it the most.
DEMENTIA RISK FOR PEOPLE 55 AND OLDER HAS DOUBLED, NEW STUDY FINDS
So, what should you put in place or revisit?
It's important to both create a will, and if possible, include your family in the process.(iStock)
First, make sure you have an updated will. This will legally set forth your wishes and make the process easier for your loved ones to work through. From clarity on what happens to your assets and personal effects to even who gets your loyalty points, being thoughtful up front assists your loved ones in carrying out your wishes while minimizing fighting between family and friends.
My suggestion is — if you have a family dynamic that allows for it — include your loved ones in the process. This way, family members can voice their concerns and thoughtswhile you are still aliveand feel like they are part of the process. Plus, some of the decisions may impact them directly, such as if family members want to be buried near each other and need to secure burial plots.
Or perhaps some family members are more comfortable playing certain roles while other members don’t want the responsibility. A frank conversation can help sort this out now when emotions aren’t in overdrive.
While there are online options to get a quick will, and that is certainly better than having no will, you may want to contact an estate planning attorney, who can give clarity on state rules that pertain to estates. Attorneys can often offer up strategies or referrals for information around tax planning and efficiency as well. They will also make sure you have the appropriate witnesses and notarization as required by your state.
My estate plan also includes powers of attorney for healthcare decisions and personal property decisions. Powers of attorney grant someone the ability to make a decision on your behalf if you cannot make those yourself, such as due to an accident or other mental incapacitation.
In addition to deciding who plays that role, it sets forth parameters for that person to follow. Your healthcare power of attorney can include directives around organ donation and burial vs. cremation, among other health and final wishes decisions.
While putting together your will and powers of attorney are great first steps, they won’t cover all your wishes and information. Think through your digital assets. What do you want your loved ones to have access to from your digital files, and what do you maybe not want anyone to see? Do you want a note left on your social media account to alert friends who may not hear about something happening to you? This is something you can put into your will directly or lay out in the given location within your legacy and wishes planning kit.
And, as you put this plan and related directives together, make sure your loved ones can find everything! It doesn’t help to have a will or power of attorney that nobody can find! Ipreviously wroteabout the Aretha Franklin will saga, where no will was found, then several different copies surfaced, including one found in the cushions of her couch. The ensuing legal battle took five years to resolve!
My suggestion is — if you have a family dynamic that allows for it — include your loved ones in the process. This way, family members can voice their concerns and thoughts while you are still alive and feel like they are part of the process. Plus, some of the decisions may impact them directly, such as if family members want to be buried near each other and need to secure burial plots.
You want to make it easy for your loved ones to find your wishes, information and documents. Consider building out a full legacy and wishes planning kit, like myFuture Filekit or similar kit you put together, that contains any information plus anything physical that a loved one or estate executor may need to access in one place.
This is where copies of your will and powers of attorney should be left. If you don’t want to physically put them in the kit, you can instead leave instructions on how to access them.

I hear from people that things like safe deposit box keys often are a major challenge to find if they are not organized in one location, like a legacy kit. Sometimes, a loved one may not know how to contact your estate planning attorney, accountant, financial advisor, bank, or other key service providers. This information should also make it into your kit as part of a comprehensive estate plan.
A side benefit of having a kit is that you have one thing to grab in case of an emergency situation, whether that be an accident, natural disaster or otherwise.
How should you get started on your estate plan or your update? Consider getting a kit like Future File that asks questions and helps you think through your wishes. Where prompted, take that information to expert service providers, starting with an estate planning attorney, to get your legal documents in order. Finally, make sure your loved ones can access that information you can put together.

Even though I did my estate plan and legacy kit a while ago, circumstances changed and I felt a ton of relief after finishing an update.
Don’t put it off — nobody knows what tomorrow may bring, as we are constantly reminded. It will give you peace of mind to know it is taken care of and will save your loved ones a lifetime of grief, as well as a ton of time and money in their time of need.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
Massachusetts must paythe federal government $2.1 billion over the next 10 years to resolve a debt after the state under former GOP Gov. Charlie Baker's administration mistakenly used federal pandemic funds to cover unemployment benefits.
Current Gov. Maura Healey, a Democrat, and her deputies released details on Monday of a settlement they reached with the outgoing Biden administration last week in which the state will repay most of the money it owed because of the error, theState House News Servicereported.
In 2023, Healey announced that her administration uncovered that the prior administration improperly used about $2.5 billion in federal pandemic relief funds to cover unemployment benefits that should have been funded by the state.
The total liability exceeded $3 billion, including fees and interest, according to Healey’s office. Negotiations with the U.S. Department of Labor dropped the total owed to $2.1 billion over the next decade.

""We were dismayed to uncover early on in our term that the previous administration misspent billions of dollars in federal relief funds and that our state was facing what could have been a more than $3 billion tab to pay it back,"" Healey said in a statement on Monday.
""For the past year and a half, we have engaged in extensive negotiations with the U.S. Department of Labor to minimize the impact on Massachusetts residents, businesses and our economy,"" she continued. ""Today, we have reduced our potential liability by over $1 billion and negotiated a decade-long payment window to mitigate the impact.""
Thegovernor addedthat it is ""incredibly frustrating that the prior administration allowed this to happen"" but that the current administration is ""going to use this as a moment to come together with the business and labor community to make meaningful reforms to the Unemployment Insurance system.""

Payments will begin Dec. 1 and continue each year for the next decade.
The agreement states that principal payments must come from the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Trust Fund, which is funded by a tax on employers and is also used to cover benefits, according to the State House News Service. Interest payments will come from the state’s General Fund.
Healey’s office said businesses will not face higher rates on their unemployment insurance payments through at least the end of next year, at which point rates will depend on system reforms.

The governor vowed to pursue changes to soften the burden on employers, who already face higher costs to support an uptick ofclaims during the pandemic, according to the State House News Service.
Healey directed state Labor Secretary Lauren Jones and Administration and Finance Secretary Matthew Gorzkowicz to ""conduct a comprehensive review of the solvency of UI and assess potential reforms.""
The Healey administration projected the UI Trust Fund would be hundreds of millions of dollars in debt by the end of 2028, even before taking into account the $2.1 billion in additional payments.",1/21/2025
https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trumps-second-first-100-days-gives-democrats-opportunities,Trump’s (second) first 100 days gives Democrats opportunities,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha reacts to President Biden's speculation that he could have defeated President-elect Donald Trump and Snopes CEO Chris Richmond's insistence that Meta would still have fact-checking if Harris won.
President Donald Trumphas made no secret that his – second – first 100 days in office will be incredibly fast paced.
To that end, the country should be prepared for a ""shock and awe"" period of executive orders, addressing everything from mass deportations of illegal migrants, tariffs, ending sanctuary cities and more.
Where executive orders fall short, Trump is pushing his allies in Congress to take up parts of his agenda as legislation.

Among other things, Trump wants to push through legislation extending the 2017 tax cuts, increasing the debt limit while also slashing federal spending,comprehensive immigration reformand giving tax breaks to energy companies.
Democrats have an opportunity to make political gains if they work with the new president. FILE: President Donald Trump and former first lady Melania Trump walk along the inauguration day parade route on Pennsylvania Avenue ahead of his first term.(Evan Vucci/USA Today Network)
However, what Trump envisions, and the realities of Congress are two different things.
With Republicans’ ultra-slim majority in the House, and divisions in the Republican caucus and party generally – as the conflict between Steve Bannon and Elon Musk suggests – there is the potential for problems in various areas of Trump’s proposed agenda.
That being said, presidential powers in certain areas like immigration, national security and even tariffs, are broad enough that much, if not all, of Trump’s agenda will likely be enacted rather quickly.
All of this leaves Democrats,dispirited after an election that saw Republicans sweep the White House and both chambers of Congress, in a precarious position.
Do they continue blindly opposing Trump, despite the will of the voters who decisively elected him and handed Congress to the GOP?
Or, recognizing that ""resistance at all costs"" is an exercise in futility, do Democrats adopt a policy of strategic bipartisan cooperation?
With pre-electionpollingfrom Fox News showing that voters trusted Donald Trump rather than VP Kamala Harris by wide margins on issues like immigration (+15%), as well as the economy and crime (+8% each), doubling down on resistance would be a costly mistake.
In no uncertain terms, Democrats would be significantly better served – as would the country – if they choose the latter, and emphasize a new, moderate agenda centered on bipartisan compromise on key issues such as the economy, immigration, crime and government excess.

Positively, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jefferies has indicated that he understands the importance of this cooperation. He recently said, ""House Democrats will work to find bipartisan common ground whenever and wherever possible with the incoming administration.""
Indeed, moderate Democrats should take the lead and work with their GOP colleagues to forge compromise where it can easily be found. Securing the border, for example, is a commonsense policy that both parties can work towards together.
Moreover, by working with Republicans, Democrats would be able to ensure some of their own policies make it into final legislation.
Returning to the border and immigration, a compromise could surely be struck that minimizes the extent of Trump’s planned mass deportations by limiting them to adults who entered the country illegally and those who have committed crimes while here.
In exchange, Democrats could push for a pathway to citizenship for children who were brought here.
Further, bipartisan efforts can be made to increase the number of H1B visas for the highest skilled migrants so that America preserves its technological advantage over China.
Over the objections of many on the far-right, Trump recently came out in support of the H1B program. Democrats should take him up on that in exchange for wholly necessary steps to address illegal immigration.
Similarly, a moderate Democratic agenda must entail the end of support for sanctuary cities and soft-on-crime policies. Too often, progressives have been allowed to dictate Democrats’ position on these related issues, damaging the entire party.
With pre-election polling from Fox News showing that voters trusted Donald Trump rather than VP Kamala Harris by wide margins on issues like immigration (+15%), as well as the economy and crime (+8% each), doubling down on resistance would be a costly mistake.
To be sure, while immigration is one high-profile area for compromise, Democrats would be wise to adopt a moderate agenda across the board.
On the economy, there are middle-of-the-road policies that can keep taxes low, spur growth, and lower the cost of living – an issue that seriously hurt Democrats in the election.
A key part of this would be working with Republicans to reform education and job training programs.
There are potential deals to be made that increase funding for vocational training and school choice programs while also making education more accessible for all Americans.

In that same vein, with Republicans targeting federal spending, Democrats must finally admit that they cannot simply spend with impunity.
The national debt, now sitting at more than $36 trillion was a significant concern for voters, and the combination of inflation and high interest rates needed to combat it risk strangling the American economy.
By working with the Department of Government Efficiency, Democrats can contribute to reining in the debt while protecting core programs such as social security and Medicare.
Finally, even though foreign policy is largely the purview of the president, the challenge for Democrats here is two-fold.
They must embrace a more moderate foreign policy that recognizes the need to expand the Abraham Accords and support Israel, while finding a compromise with Trump on other issues.
Under President Joe Biden, America’s foreign policy was often prodding, weak, and relied on the misguided strategy of ""diplomacy at all costs.""

Democrats should look to support Trump’s more muscular foreign policy, in exchange for Trump’s commitment to NATO and not forcing Ukraine into a deal that overly favors Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Taken together, Democrats would be wise to heed the lessons of former President Bill Clinton. During my time in that administration, Clinton moved to the right on certain issues – the debt, crime and welfare reform – taking the mantle from Republicans and contributing to a boost in his approval.
Over the objections of many on the far-right, Trump recently came out in support of the H1B program. Democrats should take him up on that in exchange for wholly necessary steps to address illegal immigration.
Ultimately, during and after Trump’s first 100 days, Democrats cannot afford a strategy of total resistance, lest they be consigned to minority status for the foreseeable future.
If Democrats hope to demonstrate that they are a viable alternative, they must develop a new, moderate agenda that shows the American people that they are capable of putting actual governance over petty politics.

Importantly, this is not to say that Democrats need to surrender on everything, particularly on issues that go against their core principles.
Rather, it is to underscore that working with Trump and Republicans to find compromise and address issues facing all Americans is to everyone’s benefit.

President Trumpdid not pardon or commute the prison sentence of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the anonymous marketplace website Silk Road, despite his promise on the campaign trail to free him on ""day one.""
Ulbricht was convicted because his website, which was founded in 2011 and used cryptocurrency for payments, was used to sell illegal drugs, even though he did not sell any of the illicit substances himself.
After being sworn into office on Monday, Trump issued several executive actions, including efforts to reduce immigration, designating cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a move to resume federal executions and pardoning or commuting sentences to time served of people convicted in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.
But Trump's first day back in the White House came to an end with Ulbricht still behind bars without a pardon or commutation from the president, who pledged to do so last spring.
TRUMP VOWS TO COMMUTE PRISON SENTENCE OF SILK ROAD FOUNDER ROSS ULBRICHT

In May, Trump delivered a speech at theLibertarian National Conventionto a hostile crowd of boos in an attempt to win over Libertarian voters. Libertarians believe government investigators overreached in their case against Silk Road and generally oppose the War on Drugs.
While the attendees were not favorable to Trump for most of the event, they did give a big cheer when he said he would commute Ulbricht's sentence to time served, as the crowd chanted ""Free Ross"" in the hopes that the then-presidential candidate would take action if elected to allow the Silk Road founder to return home to his family after more than a decade behind bars.
""If you vote for me, on day one I will commute the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, to a sentence of time served. He’s already served 11 years. We’re going to get him home,"" Trump told the crowd of Libertarians, many of whom were holding signs that read ""Free Ross.""
Ulbricht reacted to Trump's comments the following day on the social media platform X.
""Last night, Donald Trump pledged to commute my sentence on day 1, if reelected,"" he wrote. ""Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. After 11 years in prison, it is hard to express how I feel at this moment. It is thanks to your undying support that I may get a second chance.""

Last month, Ulbricht wrote: ""For my last monthly resolution of 2024, I intend to study every day and to get up to speed as much as I can as I prepare for freedom.""
Trump later reiterated his promise to commute Ulbricht's life sentence at a bitcoin conference, which he received loud cheers for.
Despite Trump failing to deliver on his promise to free Ulbricht on his first day back in office, the president reportedly may still grant him clemency as early as Tuesday.
""Pres. Trump's staff just confirmed to me Ross's pardon will be issued late tonight or tomorrow morning,"" Libertarian Party chair Angela McArdle wrote Monday night on X.
Elon Musk, who serves in the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration, also said Ulbricht would be released soon.
""Ross will be freed,"" Musk wrote on X.
Many Libertarians have said they supported Trump in November's election, citing, in part, his commitment to free Ulbricht.

During his first term, Trump considered intervening to release Ulbricht before ultimately deciding against a pardon.
Ulbricht, now 40, operated the website from 2011 until his arrest in 2013. He wassentenced two years laterto life in prison.
""I was trying to help us move toward a freer and more equitable world,"" Ulbricht said from prison in 2021. ""We all know the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and now here I am. I'm in hell.""

President-electDonald Trump’sinaugurationwill be one of the most transformational moments in our nation’s history. Not the mainstream media, not the political establishment, not even an assassin’s bullet could stop Donald J. Trump. On inauguration day, I’ll be in Washington representing the great state of Arkansas, cheering as Trump puts his hand on the Bible, takes his oath of office, and becomes our nation’s 47th president.
For Republican governors around the country, this moment couldn’t come soon enough.
The last four years of the Biden-Harris presidency have been disastrous for our country. Where that administration failed, governors have had to step up – on the economy, the border and public safety. We are ready to have a partner and a fighter back in the White House.
BIDEN DHS EXEMPTED THOUSANDS OF IMMIGRANTS FROM TERROR-RELATED ENTRY RESTRICTIONS IN FY 2024
Not long after I took office in 2023,Biden’s border crisis reached its peak,with thousands of illegal immigrants crossing into our country daily. Arkansas joined other Republican-led states to send National Guardsmen to the southern border to assist our friends in Texas. I traveled there that summer to thank our guardsmen and get a firsthand look at the Biden border crisis.

What I saw and heard was heartbreaking: National Guardsmen were sweating it out in temperatures exceeding 100 degrees, enough fentanyl was flowing across our border to stop every American’s heart many times over, and the migrants – whomPresident Joe Bidenwas purportedly helping – were often dying of exhaustion in the desert.
We will soon have a president who takes border security seriously. Republican governors stand in lockstep with the incoming president, ready to get violent illegal immigrants out of our states and keep our country secure.
Biden’s failures extend to the economy as well. Under his reckless tax-and-spend policies, prices rose more than 20% nationwide. For everyday items like eggs, milk, rent and gas, inflation has crippled American families.
As governor, I go into communitiesaround our state and meet with people who really cannot afford those kinds of price increases: the mom who has to skip her own dinner just so her kids don’t go hungry, the restaurant owner who has to let employees go because food costs are up so much, the family that can’t take a vacation this summer because gas prices are so expensive.
My administration has cut taxes three times to give these families relief, and I am working to responsibly phase out Arkansas’ personal income tax entirely. But for families that need assistance today, Trump can deliver. He’s promised to cut taxes for hardworking middle-class families and – more importantly – he promised to slash the wasteful spending that drove inflation in the first place.
What I’m most excited for in a newTrump administration: the American people will finally have a leader in the White House again. Biden took an antagonistic attitude toward state leaders who dared to disagree with his administration.

He tried to rewrite Title IX, allowing men to take women’s scholarships and forcing boys into girls’ locker rooms. Arkansas sued his administration and won – but we really shouldn’t have to fight the federal government on such commonsense issues.
Biden’s EPA was notorious for its regulatory overreach. His bureaucrats, operating on computer screens in Washington, tried to regulate factories and businesses in Arkansas out of existence based on shoddy projections and twisted research. Arkansas sued the federal government again. It will be great to have a president who actually understands how to run a business making decisions about some of our state’s biggest employers.

This past November, I was honored when voters inmy great state of Nevadareelected me to the United States Senate. In that same election, Nevadans also voted to elect Donald Trump as president of the United States, the first Republican presidential candidate to win the state since 2004. One of the defining issues in both our races was the high cost of living, which is squeezing hardworking Nevada families and creating financial hardship. Families are frustrated with the elevated prices they are seeing, and they have every right to be. During the election, voters made their economic frustration clear at the ballot box.
Americans work hard every day, but many are still struggling to get by because prices have skyrocketed over the last few years, from the grocery store to the gas pump. This has forced families all over the country to make difficult choices about whether to put food on the table, keep a roof over their heads or fill up their tanks. That’s why I’ve been pushing Washington to take action tolower costs for familiesand reduce their financial burden, to give them much-needed breathing room.
Since coming to Congress,I’ve been clear that I will work with anyone – regardless of party or ideology – to deliver for families in my state. I’m focused on results, not playing politics. It’s why I’ve repeatedly been ranked as one of the nation’s most bipartisan and independent senators. We certainly won’t agree on every issue, but if Trump is serious about providing financial relief for hardworking families by lowering costs, then I’m willing to try to work with him on that. Here are a few ways that we can start.
DUFFY CONFIRMATION HEARING MARKED BY BIPARTISANSHIP, PLEDGE TO VISIT HELENE-DEVASTATED STATES
One of Trump’s most notable promises on the campaign trail, one that he unveiled in Nevada, was to end taxes on tips for service workers. Growing up in a working-class family and working as a waitress while I went to school, I know what it’s like to work multiple jobs and rely on tips to help make ends meet. I’ve never forgotten where I came from, and I’m not afraid to embrace a good idea, even if it comes from the other side of the aisle.
There is potential for both parties to find bipartisan ways to help working families.(iStock)
That’s why I was quick to support this proposal last Congress and will be supporting legislation to implement it again this year. By ending income taxes on tips, with guardrails to prevent the ultra-wealthy like CEOs from exploiting loopholes, we can ensure that Americans keep more of their hard-earned money.
Another idea brought up during the campaign was to cut taxes for hardworking families by extending and increasing the Child Tax Credit. In fact, Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance called for it to be raised to $5,000. This tax credit has been a major lifeline for working families in Nevada and across the country who are doing their best to keep their heads above water.

That extra money makes a world of difference for families that are now able to afford quality childcare, buy essentials like diapers and baby wipes, or pay for a visit to the doctor. By lowering the tax burden for families through an enhanced Child Tax Credit, we’re investing in American families and strengthening our country as a result.
We can also work together to make it easier for families to rent or own a home across the nation. Trump and I have both called on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, which would help lower home prices. We also need to strengthen the United States’ construction workforce and increase our housing supply, which would lower costs and help more families find an affordable place to live. And we can take steps to make more federally owned land available for the responsible development of affordable housing.

I’ve never forgotten where I came from, and I’m not afraid to embrace a good idea, even if it comes from the other side of the aisle.
As Congress and the incoming administration continue to negotiate the upcoming comprehensive tax package, we must focus on making sure that it provides meaningful tax relief for America’s middle class. Individuals, families and small businesses deserve breathing room and peace of mind. We can deliver by making sure this package primarily benefits them, not the ultra-wealthy and major corporations.

What we need are commonsense, forward-thinking economic policies that put the American people first. That’s why I am deeply concerned about Trump’s plan to enact sweeping tariffs. This would lead to higher prices that Americans would have to pay at the checkout counter, and it would devastate working families’ budgets. This is no way to help working people, and I hope he quickly recognizes the harm that broad tariffs would cause to consumers.
Hardworking Americans face real financial challenges that impact their lives every day. We can work together to bring down costs and set families up for success. I am willing to work with anyone from any party to make this happen. By working together — Democrats and Republicans, President-elect Trump and Congress — we can help make the American Dream a reality — one that is affordable for all Americans to pursue.

For those who choose to stay, Altman predicts it will take years to rebuild, and the cost will be astronomical.
""People have to understand the build process,"" he shared. ""Most people haven't built homes in their lives, so they probably assume it's a lot easier and a lot quicker than it is. … It's a very difficult process, especially in a place like California.

The Homeland Security chairman and Tennessee Republican put forth a pair of bills on Friday – one to use tariffs to create a low-interest loan program for companies to relocate from China toLatin America.
Another would use tariffs collected on Chinese goods to offer a tax incentive to offset moving costs for U.S. companies to bring their operations back to U.S. soil.
The Western Hemisphere Nearshoring Act would institute a program through the International Development Finance Corporation to buy down interest rates with tariff money.

Under the Bring American Companies Home Act, amounts paid to move inventory, equipment or supplies used in a trade or businessfrom Chinato the U.S. would be allowed as a deduction on taxes. The program would be funded through a trust fund of tariffs collected.
""Communist China's malign influence continues to spread throughout the Western Hemisphere. It's time for us to take a stand. By rebuilding infrastructure and manufacturing jobs in this region, we can mute China's siren song,"" Green told Fox News Digital.

The U.S. has long invested heavily in Latin America and the Carribean, but China is South America’s biggest trading partner and benefactor. As part of itsBelt and Road initiative, it is increasingly flexing its muscle with grants and loans across the continent. China in November unveiled a megaport in Peru.

Trump has signaled that he will re-prioritize the western hemisphere, a priority dating back to the Monroe Doctrine of 1823, through calls for the U.S. to take back the Panama Canal.
Over the past few weeks, Trump has insisted that China is in control of the canal and thatPanama is ""ripping off"" the U.S.

A Californiahome worth around $2 million has been wrecked by a landslide, having been left fortuitously unscathed from the devastating Los Angeles wildfires.
The one-story oceanfront property in Pacific Palisades was split in two by a landslide and crumbled,Fox 11 LA reports. It has been left surrounded by mud with running water also being observed nearby.
The one bedroom, one bathroom home, sold a few years ago for close to $2 million and rented for $14,000 a month, Fox 11 LA reported, citing online data. It’s located on Castellammare Drive.
Landslides have become the latest concern for homeowners and officials in Los Angeles as water being used to battle the blazes can make the ground weak, making foundations unstable. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has also warned of the danger of mudslides and landslides after wildfires because the fires destroy vegetation that would otherwise secure the soil.

The Pacific Palisades has been worst hit by thedevastating wildfiresin terms of fire damage. It has burned more than 23,700 acres, per the Los Angeles Times. At least 10 people are confirmed dead while another 17 have been killed in the Eaton Fire, Fox 11 reports.
The Palisades fire was 27% contained as of about 8 p.m. Thursday, up from 22% in the early morning.
Bryan Kirkwood, a security guard hired to protect homes from looters, was shocked to see the home torn apart.
""This is devastating. I didn’t realize it was this bad,"" Kirkwood told KTLA. ""I didn’t see the news, got out here and looked and it didn’t hit me until now. Wow. This is a big deal.""

BRUCE WILLIS THANKS LA FIRST RESPONDERS WITH ‘A HEARTFELT HANDSHAKE’
Mark Pestrella, the director of theLos AngelesCounty Department of Public Works, said that the sheer amount of water being dispersed to put out the flames is having unintended consequences.
""What we call dry gravel, which is the slopes that are over steep and have been really dried out. And you will see this raveling of the slopes and what looks like a landslide and it is a landslide,"" Pestrella told Fox 11.
""Debris into the streets and into properties. Some of this material supports some of the structures that have remained behind. There has been inundation to some extent of water into the system.""
He added that during firefighting efforts, gas and water lines were also destroyed and water was shut off in some areas located in the Palisades fire zones.
""We did that for two reasons. One is because we wanted to maintain a water pressure in the system, and not lose it to properties, but also in anticipation that it could grease the will of landslides,"" he said.
He said there is a significant amount of dry gravel in the lower Topanga area too.
""We're working in consultation side by side with Caltrans to maintain those slopes so that we can continue to have access into the area.""

""So, [as] a warning to all the residents, no matter where you live in LA County, if you have slopes, behind your homes, or if you're located on top of a slope, these slopes have become fragile,"" Pestrella said.
""The soil that is supporting your home has become fragile and damaged due to the events that we've had and wind included. There [is] mud and debris.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/blame-biden-homelessness-skyrocketing,Blame Biden for homelessness skyrocketing,"Tunnel to Towers chairman and CEO Frank Siller joins 'The Five' to talk about solving veteran homelessness.
A shocking new report by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shows thathomelessnesshas increased dramatically from the start of Joe Biden’s term, yet another sign of the outgoing president’s remarkable track record of failure.
Since 2007, HUD has published data annually that provides an official estimate forhomelessness. The data seeks to show how many people are homeless in America in January of each year, as well as provide researchers with a variety of demographic data and reports from on-the-ground sources about potential causes of homelessness.
In December, HUD reported that in January 2024, ""771,480 people experienced homelessness in the United States."" HUD notes that this is ""the largest number since data collection began."" (The first year of data provided in HUD’s report is 2007.)
THE LEFT'S HOMELESS PLANS WRECKED OUR CITIES. NOW HELP MAY COME FROM AN UNEXPECTED SOURCE
In 2023, HUD reported homelessness had reached 653,104, which was, at the time, the highest figure ever recorded.
HUD’s data showshomelessnesswas 580,466 at the start of 2020, Trump’s final year in office. (Due to COVID-19, the data for 2021 is incomplete.)
That means from 2020 to 2024, homelessness increased by more than 32%.
These figures become even more disconcerting when placed in their proper historical context. From 2013 to 2022, HUD’s estimates for homelessness never once surpassed 600,000.
Homelessness remained relatively stable for the eight years prior to Biden taking office, consistently ranging between 500,000 and 600,000.
HUD’s report notes that men and boys are more likely to be homeless than women. About six in ten homeless Americans are male.
Additionally, African Americans and white Americans are more likely to be homeless than other racial groups. About 31% of the homeless population is believed to be African American, and 38% of the homeless population is white.
These figures indicate that when accounting for differences in the total population sizes of various racial groups in the United States, African American men are much more likely to be homeless than other demographics.
There are numerous reasons why homelessness has increased under the Biden administration, and many of them are the direct result of policy decisions made by the outgoing president.
First, the cost ofhousinghas risen at a breakneck pace under Biden. The Washington Post reports that from 2019 to 2024, monthly rent increased by 19 percent.
Similarly, the average sales price of a home sold in the United States increased from $396,900 in the fourth quarter of 2020 to $501,100 in the third quarter of 2024, the most recent year for which data is available. That’s a 26% increase in just four years.
Although rent and home sales prices are impacted by numerous factors, the driving force behind the increases is the macro-level inflation crisis caused by the Biden administration’s unprecedented government spending and regulatory agenda.
Biden and congressional Democrats poured trillions of dollars into theeconomyduring Biden’s term in office, keeping spending levels significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. The additional spending was largely the result of new debt that wasnotoffset by new taxes. That means Biden, working closely with congressional Democrats, increased the money supply.
Increasing the money supply isn’t always a bad thing. But when you increase the money supply rapidly and consistently, as did Biden, and couple that increase with inflationary government programs and regulations that drive up costs, you run the risk of causing an inflation crisis.
That’s exactly what happened throughout much of the U.S. economy, including in the housing sector.
Adding more dollars to the economy without increasing housing at a similar rate caused housing and rent prices to rise quickly, along with prices of just about everything else.
When the cost of housing increases,homelessnessoften increases with it.
Housing costs aren’t the only explanation for the rise in homelessness, though. Another is the Biden administration’s immigration policies.
The U.S. House Committee on Homeland Security reported earlier this month that the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency has had since fiscal year 2021 more than 11 million encounters with immigrants illegally in the country.
This doesn’t include the millions of other people who have entered the United States illegally during the same period but weren’t caught by CBP.
This wave of immigration has been caused by the weak border and asylum-seeker policies put into place by the Biden administration. These policies and their associated rise in illegal immigration have put a tremendous amount of stress on local resources, including housing and shelters.

In its report, HUD, an agency in Biden’s own administration, acknowledges that immigration has been one of the primary causes of the recent increase in homelessness. HUD says natural disasters have also caused homelessness to rise in some regions, particularly in Hawaii.
HUD’s study includes reports provided by local homelessness planning bodies called continuums of care (CoCs). HUD notes that ""In 2024, many of the CoCs that reported the largest increases in sheltered homelessness, reported that they experienced an increase from people who were displaced from natural disasters or due to immigration. For example, in Hawaii, over 5,000 people were in disaster emergency shelter due to the Maui Fire. Another 13 CoCs indicated an increase due to an increase in immigrants or refugees seeking asylum.""
The CoC for New York City told HUD that close to 88% of its increase in sheltered homelessness was due directly to a substantial rise in asylum seekers.

Homelessness has reached a crisis level in the United States, and Biden’s policies are largely to blame. His high regulations and reckless spending have driven up housing costs to unsustainable levels, and his immigration policies have overwhelmed many cities’ housing markets and homeless facilities.
To address these problems, President Trump must reduce government spending, roll back regulations, and fix America’s broken immigration system. He has promised to do just that, but governing is much harder than campaigning, as the incoming president knows well.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/zuckerberg-other-moguls-say-theyre-backing-off-esg-dei-real,"Zuckerberg, other moguls say they're backing off ESG and DEI but are they for real?","'Hannity' panelists Riley Gaines, Joe Concha and Leo Terrell give their take on DEI and the Trump transition team.
Over the past 18 months, theEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) agendahas suffered setbacks in corporate DEI programs, declining investment dollars, and the collapse of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance.
In just the last month, major banks withdrew from net-zero alliances andMeta dismantledmany of its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs. ESG seems to be coming unglued. But don’t be fooled.
A closer look at what the banks have said reveals that they are still full of unrepentant ESG financiers. Many of the touted changes are superficial or cosmetic rather than indicative of an underlying philosophical shift.
Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives have been the subject of heated opinions of praise and rebuke.(Adobe Stock)
Dozens of Fortune 500 companies (includingMcDonald's and Walmart) representing trillions of dollars of market cap and millions of employees rolled back or nixed their DEI programs in 2024. ESG-labeled investment funds hemorrhaged cash over the past two years. And the incoming administration has promised to jettison DEI in federal agencies.
DEI IS LIKE A WOKE IED FOR THE LEFT’S WAR AGAINST OUR MILITARY. WE MUST DEFUSE IT
The Net-Zero Insurance Alliance has fallen apart with the mass exodus of insurance companies over the past year and a half when many state attorneys general expressed concern that participating in such an alliance might violate anti-trust and anti-collusion laws. U.S. states have withdrawn billions of dollars from Blackrock due to concerns about ESG.
These changes are welcome corrections to the flawed and deeply ideological goals of ESG advocates. The latest dominos to fall are large American financial institutions.Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America, and JP Morgan have all withdrawn from the global Net-Zero Banking Alliance.
Even Blackrock, once a vocal advocate of ESG, withdrew from Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. Though this may appear to be of a piece with other rollbacks of ESG, cynicism is warranted.
If you look at the press releases from these large financial institutions, you’ll find that they are unrepentant and still intend to pursue net zero goals. For example, Goldman stated:""Our priorities remain to help our clients achieve their sustainability goals and to measure and report on our progress.""Citigroup was even more blunt: ""we remain committed to reaching net zero.""
I WAS FORCED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST MY SCHOOL DISTRICT TO HALT COMPELLED SPEECH, RACIST DEI
Blackrock has beenthe most explicitly unrepentant. ""[O]ur memberships in some of these organizations have caused confusion… and subjected us to legal inquiries… [But this] does not change the way we develop products and solutions for clients or how we manage their portfolios."" Translation: ""We just want to distance ourselves from problematic PR, but we are not changing a single thing about how we do business.""
The moves by these large banks seem to imitate Blackrock CEO Larry Fink’s strategy of not using the term ""ESG"" because it was a political hot potato, but remaining committed to ""sustainability."" Blackrock remains heavily invested in green infrastructure and renewable energy projects.
That’s fine if their clients explicitly ask for such investments. But as American Airlines learned last week, pension fund managers have a fiduciary obligation to pursue the best financial returns for their clients and they can be held liable for using the funds they manage for other ends.
NEARLY HALF OF ALL US COLLEGE STUDENTS REJECT MANDATORY DEI COURSES ON CAMPUS: STUDY
While superficial progress has been made with U.S. financial institutions withdrawing from destructive global net-zero alliances, they appear insincere when it comes to truly changing their ways. This should not be surprising given that bank personnel have not changed much. Nor do we see evidence of a change of heart when it comes to ESG.
Instead, they seem concerned about public pressure and criticism from theincoming federal administrationand from state government officials. Withdrawing from these alliances also gives them a freer hand to signal net zero intentions without having to deliver on them by a fixed date.
But if ESG policy was distracting and destructive before, it is still so now. Ideological ESG priorities detract from companies’ ability to function well and benefit their contractual stakeholders. Companies have a hard enough time being profitable without pursuing various social justice priorities.

Banks would do better to clarify their commitment to maximizing shareholder value and doing business with everyone. Pursuing long-term profit successfully benefits shareholders, workers, suppliers and customers.
Most corporations, especially the unrepentant financiers, need to clean house in their human resources departments to focus on value creation rather than racial identity politics or costly virtue-signaling on environmental and social issues. And as theAmerican Airlines caseshows, companies that fail to do so may very well be violating their fiduciary duty to clients and to shareholders.

President Biden leaves office with negative job and personal ratings, as voters continue to give the economy bad marks — and say the White House failed to make improvements.
A new Fox News survey shows almost twice as many think theBiden administrationhas made the economy worse rather than better, 52% vs. 28%. Plus, nearly all voters, 89%, say they are either extremely or very concerned about inflation — up from 83% early in his term (2021).
Overall, 70% say the economy is in bad shape. While that’s better than the high during Biden’s term of 84% who rated it negatively in July 2022, it’s also back to where things stood at the start of his presidency when 69% said the same.
""Despite presiding over the strongest post-pandemic economic recovery in the world and making historic investments in infrastructure that will produce millions of new jobs over the next decade, voters clearly judged Biden’s efforts on the economy as counterproductive,"" says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, whose firm Beacon Research conducts Fox News surveys along with Republican Daron Shaw. ""Time will tell if history judges him differently.""
FOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP IS THE MOST POPULAR HE'S EVER BEEN
Only 13% of voters say they are getting ahead financially. Three times that many, 42%, feel they are falling behind — and that’s up 15 points from 27% who felt that way nearly four years ago.
Part of that increase is driven by Democrats, who are twice as likely to say they are falling behind today: 38% vs. 19% in June 2021.
And nearly 6 in 10Democratsagree with 8 in 10 Republicans and 7 in 10 independents that the economy is in only fair or poor condition.
""If elections are mostly about how voters think the incumbent party handled the economy, it’s easy to see why the Democrats lost the 2024 election,"" says Shaw. ""Unfortunately for Biden, he continues to be ineffective at making the case that his policies have improved the bottom-line, even among his base.""
As Biden departs, 42% of voters approve of his job performance — just 2 percentage points above his record low.
Approval of Biden is lower thanBarack Obama(57%) and Bill Clinton (62%) at the end of their presidencies, but higher than George W. Bush (34%). Some 47% approved of Donald Trump at the end of his first term.
Biden’s highest approval, 56%, came six months into his presidency (June 2021). His lowest, 40% approval, came at three points during his term (July 2022, November 2023 and October 2024).
The average job rating for his entire presidency stands at 44% approve vs. 55% disapprove.
FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS VIEW 2024 NEGATIVELY BUT HAVE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE
Eighty percent of Democrats approve of Biden as he leaves, as do 35% of independents and 9% of Republicans. For comparison, at the 100-day mark of his presidency, 95% of Democrats approved, as did 42% of independents and 14% of Republicans.
Views on Biden as a person are the reverse of what they were when he was elected. At the end of 2020, some 59% of voters had a favorable opinion of him, while 39% had an unfavorable opinion. The final read shows 40% view him favorably and 59% unfavorably.
That makes him less popular thanTrumpat the end of his first term (45% favorable, 54% unfavorable), and Obama (60%-39%), Bush (49%-46%) and Clinton (48%-46%) at the end of their time in office.

Former NFL veteran-turned-Texas state legislator Scott Turner said Thursday during his confirmation hearing to be the nextHousing and Urban Development(HUD) secretary his goal will be to help people get off government assistance and become more self-sustainable.
Testifying before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Turner said, if confirmed, his priorities would be to advance and expand polices heralded by the incoming Trump administration.
""This moment is not just about fixing what’s broken. It’s about continuing and expanding the policies from the first Trump administration — policies that worked,"" Turner said Thursday. He added that his ""goal"" as HUD secretary will be ""to help people get off government assistance, become self-sustainable and achieve the American dream.""
Turner previously served as executive director of the Trump administration’s Opportunity and Revitalization Council that established""Opportunity Zones,""an economic revitalization plan aimed at helping low-income, minority communities, which Turner said he hopes to expand. Turner also said he plans to cut red tape, engage with state, local and private partners to improve the cost of housing and ""maximize"" HUD's current budget.

""There are many factors to why housing is so expensive now, and I believe first we need to get our own fiscal house in order,"" Turner told Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., when she asked Turner if he would support additional federal investment to lower the cost to build more affordable housing. ""I do look forward to looking at the HOME Program and other programs, but there's record funding from HUD. HUD's budget is nearly $70 billion at this point, and we're still not meeting the need that we're supposed to be meeting.""
Democrats at the hearing suggested they were concerned that Turner would slash federal funding for certain programs, such as HUD’s Section 8 housing program and the agency's flagship HOME Investment Partnership Program. When probed about his approach to funding certain programs, Turner told Democrats he would work with them to review their concerns on a case-by-case basis but did not confirm one way or the other whether he would slash funding.
""The federal financing is a key part of financing housing, and affordable housing in Nevada,"" Sen. Catherine Cortez, D-Nev., said Thursday.
""We need to make some big changes,"" Warren added. ""To really move the needle, the federal government needs to be a good partner, investing in affordable housing and spurring local innovation to cut red tape.""
At one point during the hearing, Turner was asked about his support for work requirements for those receiving Section 8 housing assistance, telling committee members he thought it was a good idea. When Turner tried to explain his reasoning, he was cut off by the senator questioning him and unable to respond.

In addition to their questions about funding HUD programs, Democrats also questioned Turner over whether he would work to remove alleged racial bias from the housing appraisal industry and whether he intends to go after ""price gouging"" from real estate investors. Again, Turner did not say ""no"" but said he would commit to looking into the issue with Democrats and make a determination from there. However, Turner did rail against diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) requirements at HUD for housing grant applicants.
CONFIRMATION DELAYS STACK UP FOR TRUMP NOMINEE AS PAPERWORK LAGS IN FEDERAL OFFICES
""When we grant assistance, obviously there's accountability, there's transparency, but to hold anyone hostage because of a politicization of an agency, or a process, is wrong across the board,"" Turner said when asked if he would investigate such polices.

Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., chairman of the committee, echoed Turner's concerns that HUD has failed to live up to its mission and that housing is about more than just putting a roof over someone's head.
""Housing isn’t just about shelter, it’s about opportunity, and it is about stability,"" Scott said Thursday. ""Despite all the subsidies and all the trillions of dollars [the Biden administration] spent, not much good has happened. But, today, it is a new day in America, and new leadership brings hope and opportunity and enthusiasm back to the American people.""",1/16/2025

Gavin Newsom to loosen environmental regulations for all Californians,"Leonardo and Giorgi Antinori joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss how they are coping after the unspeakable tragedy and what's next for them as they contemplate rebuilding after losing everything in the Los Angeles fires.
The Wall Street Journal argued that California Gov. Gavin Newsom should waive environmental regulations for all Californians, not justvictims of the firesin Los Angeles.
Thepaper's editorial boardsaid Newsom should use the same logic behind waiving environmental regulations to aid in the rebuilding of Los Angeles to help make life easier for Californians in general.
""California Gov. Gavin Newsomon Sunday waived the state’s environmental laws in areas affected by the fires to expedite rebuilding,"" the editorial board wrote in an article published Tuesday.

""Wonderful, but that raises a question: Why not ease regulations for all projects if the rules are such a barrier to development?"" The Journal asked.
TheCalifornia Environmental Quality Act(CEQA) requires that a review be conducted to weigh any potential environmental effects before a building permit is approved. Another state law, the California Coastal Act, focuses on development as it relates to ""the preservation of sensitive coastal and marine habitat and biodiversity.""
Both laws were halted on Sunday for those who tragically lost their homes after Newsom signed an executive order to suspend the environmental review process.

""California's environmental laws also delay and inflate costs of needed public works, when they don't kill them,"" The Journal wrote.
""If Mr. Newsom agrees that the state's environmental laws are a problem, why doesn't he at least try to reform them?"" the editorial board asked.
""The reason is Democrats in Sacramento are beholden to the green lobby, which opposes most development and uses the laws to extort businesses,"" The Journal wrote. ""It's nice of Mr. Newsom to ease permitting so L.A.'s affluent can rebuild. Perhaps he's worried they might leave if it takes too long or costs too much to rebuild.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-tax-leaders-us-small-businesses-could-pay-more-tax-than-small-businesses-do-china-trump-cuts-expire,GOP tax leaders: US small businesses could pay more tax than small businesses do in China if Trump cuts expire,"Economist Steve Moore joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the economic impacts of extending the Trump-era tax cuts and proposes a possible flat tax for the United States.
Republicans on the House Ways & Means Committee, the House's chief tax writing committee, pointed out during a Tuesday hearing that if Congress lets President-elect Trump's tax cuts from his first term expire, millions of small businesses in the United States will see a top tax rate that is higher than what small businesses in communist China pay.
Tuesday's hearing launched debate inthe new Congressover how to handle Trump's expiring tax credits, key provisions of which are slated to expire later this year. Among those key provisions is a new 20% tax deduction ushered in by Trump in 2017, known as Section 199-A, which provides tax relief for qualified trade or business expenses incurred by taxpayers that are not corporations.
But, if Trump's Section 199-A deduction expires later this year, small business owners could see their top tax rate more than double to 43.4%, which is roughly 20 points higher than what businesses in communist China face, Ways & Means Chairman Rep. Jason Smith, R-Mo., laid out in areportearlier this month and reiterated during Tuesday's hearing.
""If Congress fails to act … 26 million small businesses will be hit with a 43.4 percent top tax rate, more than 20 points higher than what businesses pay inCommunist China,""Smith said Tuesday.

Smith's concerns were also echoed by otherRepublicanson the committee during Tuesday's hearing.
""I guess my colleagues want to go back to when we had higher tax rates than communist China,"" said Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas. ""What's pro-American about that? How are we going to unleash economic growth, job creation, and prosperity with that kind of tax rate? We reduced it to 21% and we're not even in the top quarter of the most competitivetax rates.So, I guess my colleagues want to go back to the highest business tax rate in the free world. It makes no sense.""
""The 21% rate in the United States of America – when you add the average state rate across the United States – is at 25%,"" added Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla. ""Our greatest adversary in the world economically – no one is even close – is China at 25%.""

Allison Couch, the founder of Ignite Accounting and one of the witnesses present at Tuesday's hearing, referred to 199-A as ""the single most beneficial deduction for small business owners.""
""Allowing this deduction to lapse when it has been in place for so many years will not feel like a sunset, but a tax increase,"" said Couch, who also submitted a report into the congressional record during Tuesday's hearing from global accounting firm Ernst & Young, which indicated 25.9 millionsmall businessesin the United States utilize the 199-A deduction.
TRUMP TASKS BLUE STATE REPUBLICANS WITH ‘HOMEWORK’ AS GOP PLOTS MASSIVE CONSERVATIVE POLICY OVERHAUL
Other provisions that Republicans and the pro-TCJA witnesses at the hearing called on to become permanent included Trump's beefed up child tax credit, which doubled parents' eligible deduction, hisdeath tax reforms,which doubled the amount heirs could pass on before being taxed, and lower marginal tax rates for individuals, a move that one witness said Tuesday has helped workers earn more take-home pay.

However, Democrats at the hearing argued that an extension of Trump's tax cuts will benefit the ultra wealthy more than anyone else. They also argued that Republicans are ignoring the deficit impact, and not providing adequate solutions for how to pay for the extended cuts, noting that increased deficits could result in increased interest rates, a grater cost burden for middle-class people and less economic growth.
""There's no free lunch here,"" said Brendan Duke, senior director ofeconomic policyat the left-leaning Center for American Progress. ""The tax cuts will likely be paid for eventually in the form of spending cuts or tax increases down the line. In the meantime, continued, or even higher deficits could mean continued or even higher interest rates. That makes housing, student loans and credit card debt less affordable for working people.""
PLANNED PARENTHOOD CHAPTER PROVIDED HARRIS CAMPAIGN WORKSPACE, BREAKING TAX LAW: IRS COMPLAINT
""Republican reliance on tariff taxes to off-set their tax breaks for the super wealthy will continue to shift the tax burden to some of the very type of businesses that [Republicans want to protect]"" warned Democratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett. ""The biggest loser of their plan overall will be our debt, but the impact that that has on the solvency of Social Security, and Medicare and other investments, is also very critical. So, as we move forward we need to consider all of these impacts and look for a tax code that is mor fair for working Americans and less of a gift to those at the top.""

In response to the battle in Congress over the expiring tax cuts, a fiscally conservative political advocacy group,Americans for Prosperity,launched a $20 million campaign to urge lawmakers on Capitol Hill ""to protect prosperity"" by renewing Trump's tax cuts.
The campaign will include ads in all 50 states as the group says Congress is ""facing a countdown to crisis that threatens the family budgets of virtually every American."" Notably, Americans for Prosperity, endorsed Trump's presidential contender Nikki Haley prior to Trump becoming the GOP's nominee.

House Oversight Chairman James Comer ripped Special Counsel David Weiss' final report on his years-longinvestigation into Hunter Bidenas ""incomplete"" due to President Biden's sweeping pardon of his son.
""Special Counsel David Weiss just released an incomplete 27-page report because President Joe Biden issued his son an unprecedented pardon. This sweeping pardon prevents the Special Counsel from holding Hunter Biden accountable for the international influence peddling racket only made possible by Joe Biden,""Rep. Comer, R-Ky., saidin a statement Monday evening following the release of Weiss' final report.
""Let’s be clear: the Biden DOJ was never going to prosecute the Biden Crime Family. The House Oversight Committee’s investigation of the Bidens’ influence peddling schemes revealed how Joe Biden knew about, participated in, and benefited from his family cashing in on the Biden name,"" Comer continued.
The Department of Justice released Weiss' report to Congress on Monday evening, which detailed his roughly six-year investigation into first son Hunter Biden's taxes and purchase of a firearm in 2018 while he was addicted to controlled substances – namely, crack cocaine.
WEISS REPORT: HUNTER’S DRUG USE CAN’T EXPLAIN AWAY NOT PAYING TAXES ON MONEY EARNED BY 'LAST NAME'
Hunter Biden was convicted in both caseslast year, with a jury of his peers finding him guilty of three felony firearm offenses, and entering a surprise guilty plea regarding the failure to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes across a four-year period.
DOJ RELEASES SPECIAL COUNSEL DAVID WEISS' REPORT ON HUNTER BIDEN
Amid the legal saga,President Biden repeatedly vowedhe would not pardon his son, but reversed course last month when he announced he would grant his son a blanket pardon that applies to any offenses against the U.S. that Hunter Biden ""has committed or may have committed"" from Jan. 1, 2014, to Dec. 1, 2024.

Comer continued in his blistering response to the report by citing two IRS whistleblowers who sounded the alarm on Hunter Biden's tax issues and said they were handcuffed from ""following evidence that could have led to Joe Biden.""
HUNTER BIDEN: A LOOK AT HOW THE SAGA SPANNING OVER SIX YEARS UNFOLDED
""Two brave whistleblowers, Gary Shapley and Joseph Ziegler, blew the whistle on DOJ’s misconduct and politicization in theHunter Biden criminal investigationand revealed they were prevented from following evidence that could have led to Joe Biden. Joe Biden will be remembered for using his last few weeks in office to shield his son from the law and protect himself. The president’s legacy is the same as his family’s business dealings: corrupt,"" Comer continued.

The two whistleblowers, who previously slammed Biden for pardoning his son last month, also took issue with the Weiss report and again blasted Biden for the pardon.
BIDEN PARDONS SON HUNTER BIDEN AHEAD OF EXIT FROM OVAL OFFICE
""The Weiss report leaves too many questions unanswered, and the American people deserve answers. DOJ, FBI, and IRS leadership should have done the right thing from the beginning. We should not have had to risk our careers to end the preferential treatment being given to the President's son. Years later, we are still facing whistleblower retaliation,"" Shapley and Ziegler wrote in a message shared by Empower Oversight, the legal group representing the whistleblowers.

""Why are we the only ones suffering any consequences? It's time for a serious investigation and it's time for accountability,"" they concluded.
BIDEN WON'T PARDON HUNTER, WHITE HOUSE REAFFIRMS, BUT CRITICS AREN'T SO SURE
Weiss' report also took issue with the president's pardoning of Hunter Biden, specifically with how President Biden characterized prosecutions of Hunter Biden as ""selective"" and ""unfair.""
""This statement is gratuitous and wrong,"" Weiss wrote in his report. ""Other presidents have pardoned family members, but in doing so, none have taken the occasion as an opportunity to malign the public servants at the Department of Justice based solely on false accusations.""
HUNTER BIDEN FOUND GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS IN GUN TRIAL
""Politicians who attack the decisions of career prosecutors as politically motivated when they disagree with the outcome of a case undermine the public's confidence inour criminal justice system,"" Weiss wrote in another section of the report. ""The President's statements unfairly impugn the integrity not only of Department of Justice personnel, but all of the public servants making these difficult decisions in good faith.""
Weiss' report also determined that the first son's previous and well-documented addiction tosubstances such as crack cocainecould not explain why he failed to pay taxes on millions of dollars of income earned off of his ""last name and connections.""
U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware David C. Weiss(Fox News screenshot)
""As a well-educated lawyer and businessman, Mr. Biden consciously and willfully chose not to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes over a four-year period. From 2016 to 2020, Mr. Biden received more than $7 million in total gross income, including approximately $1.5 million in 2016, $2.3 million in 2017, $2.1 million in 2018, $1 million in 2019 and $188,000 from January through October 15, 2020,"" Weiss wrote in his final report, which was released Monday.
DOJ RELEASEES FORMER SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S REPORT ON INVESTIGATION INTO TRUMP ELECTION INTERFERENCE CASE
""Mr. Biden made this money by using his last name and connections to secure lucrative business opportunities, such as a board seat at a Ukrainian industrial conglomerate, Burisma Holdings Limited, and a joint venture with individuals associated with a Chinese energy conglomerate. He negotiated and executed contracts and agreements that paid him millions of dollars for limited work,"" Weiss continued.

Weiss continued in his report that Hunter Biden ""spent millions of dollars on an extravagant lifestyle rather than paying his tax bills,"" and that he ""willfully failed to pay his 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 taxes on time, despite having access to funds to pay some or all of these taxes.""
TRUMP CALLS JACK SMITH 'DESPERATE' AFTER SPECIAL COUNSEL REPORT IS RELEASED AFTER MIDNIGHT
""These are not 'inconsequential' or ‘technical’ tax code violations,"" Weiss wrote. ""Nor can Mr. Biden's conduct be explained away by his drug use – most glaringly, Mr. Biden filed his false 2018 return, in which he deliberately underreported his income to lower his tax liability, in February 2020, approximately eight months after he had regained his sobriety. Therefore, the prosecution of Mr. Biden was warranted given the nature and seriousness of his tax crimes.""
Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on the report and Comer's response, but did not immediately receive a response.

Hunter Biden's attorney, Abbe Lowell, released a statement Monday evening following the report, ""David Weiss’ 27-page report continues to ignore some of the major mysteries of his 7-year investigation.""
""Mr. Weiss conveniently omits his proposal to resolve this investigation in 2023 with a pair of misdemeanors and a diverted gun charge recommended by career prosecutors.  Mr. Weiss also fails to explain why he reneged on his own agreement, a reversal that came at the 11th hour in court as he and his office faced blistering attacks from Republicans and his then filing unprecedented charges for someone with no aggravating gun factors who had paid his taxes in full years before the charges were filed,"" Lowell said in the statement.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-group-chicago-continues-hold-our-kids-back-from-bright-futures,One group in Chicago continues to hold our kids back from their bright futures,"Pastor and Project H.O.O.D. founder Corey Brooks says efforts to steer Southside kids away from materialism and towards faith,  family and belief in themselves have been repeatedly undermined by Chicago Teachers Union
They say our children are our future and I believe that. I have fought to dismantle the violent gangs in my neighborhood on theSouth Side of Chicagoto free the children from their grip. I have fought to make sure our children have enough to eat so hunger does not consume their upbringing. I have fought to give our children a higher value in life other than crass materialism: faith in God, respect for their parents, and belief in themselves.
Yet I find that much of my efforts to steer these children upward has been continually undermined by one force in our city: The Chicago Teachers Union.
We have long known that far too many of our Chicago schools are failing its children, especially the ones in my neighborhood. We have also had quite a monumental year in exposing the corruption, incompetence, and shortcomings of the DEI policies that have undermined education for the past several years.
CHICAGO TEACHERS UNION SLAMS NEWSPAPER THAT CALLED THEM OUT FOR THEIR MEMBERS' CHRONIC ABSENCE
Yet, the union shows no sign of slowing down its destructive path that leaves our children at the bottom of the barrel. According to Wirepoints, only 29 in every 100 Chicago students canread at grade level. Only 18% of all its students are proficient in math.
These numbers are worse for those in my neighborhood. Our schools continue to push these kids from grade to grade without demanding any form of educational excellence from them. They’re failing these kids upwards.
Again, according to Wirepoints, 81% of these students graduate! How is this possible? Where is the morality here? Who is benefitting from this lie?
Lies beget even more lies. Ninety-three percent of the teachers in Chicago are rated ""excellent or proficient."" Seventy percent of its schools are rated ""exemplary"" or ""commendable.""
The single greatest beneficiary of these lies is the Chicago Teachers Union. The damage they have done to our most vulnerable population will resonate for the years to come — we’re already seeing the impact today as lawless packs of youths roam the streets looking for trouble.
Where is their moral conscience? The failure of the schools is well-documented but the only thing the union leaders are concerned with is concentrating their own power. They take no form of accountability or responsibility for their aggressive power grabs— their own selfish power is their main interest, not the children.
CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS SUFFERING FROM 'CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM' BY TEACHERS AS UNION DEMANDS HIGHER PAY: REPORT
I recently came across aquote from the unionon X that sums up their attitude toward their critics like me: ""They want us to think that the teachers are the problem, but that has always been their message. We know the only thing that has brought progress to our schools has been a militant Chicago Teachers Union. We know the only thing that has led to improvements in the schools in my community has been an alliance, a coalition between students, teachers, staff and, of course, parents working together.""
Remember, lies beget lies. What ""improvements in the schools"" are they talking about? And what is this talk about a ""militant Chicago Teachers Union"" bringing ""progress?""
Their militancy is actually corruption.

Theirpinned post on Xsays,""This is what solidarity looks like! From powerful speeches to unwavering energy, our rally showcased the strength of educators and allies united for justice. We’re building a brighter future for our students, schools, and communities.""
The accompanying video states: ""We need leadership at the Chicago public schools who intend to protect us from the tyranny and Trump and his troops."" The last time I checked, Trump hasn’t undermined the education of these kids, but let’s go ahead and distract from the union’s abysmal record by pointing the finger at big bad orangeman.
Further, the union continues to put the blame onlack of funding— yet another lie begot. More specifically, the union is accusing the city of not properly funding all schools equally. But, according to Wirepoints, we’re spending more than ever per child: $29,160 in 2024, up from $20,979 in 2019.

Funding is not the problem.The union is. And I hate to say it, but the teachers are too. They claim their hands are tied but, after years of hearing that, I have to put the cold hard reality that we are failing our kids front and center — that’s all that matters to me.
The Chicago Teachers Union does not hold the best interests of our youth at heart and we must recognize that if we want a better America. After all, the quality of the youth of today determines the quality of the future.

That group collectively paid almost $400 million in unemployment taxes over the past 10 years, and the bill will aim to ensure those who pay into the system are able to rely on it when they need to, her office said.
The representative said Saldaña has reintroduced similar legislation during both Democrat and Republican administrations in the past because the ""inequities in our immigration system"" are systemic and longstanding.
Saldaña has previously argued that providing unemployment benefits to undocumented workers who qualify will help stabilize the workforce and prevent future cases of poverty and homelessness due to job loss.
It will therefore have lasting positive effects on the Evergreen State’s economy, her office said.
Senate Minority Leader John Braun, R-Centralia, said he had not seen the text of the bill as of Monday afternoon but was aware of the proposal itself.
CALIFORNIA BILL AIMED AT MAKING IT EASIER FOR MIGRANTS TO BUY HOMES MAKES MAJOR ADVANCEMENT
""We have a lot of work to do on immigration, both on undocumented immigrants and on legal immigration in our state. That's largely a federal issue,"" Braun said.
""I look for the folks in D.C. to handle [the immigration issue] and for us [in state government] to stay clear.""
Under federal law,illegal immigrantsare not eligible to apply for work permits and, therefore, unable to register or file for unemployment compensation. Neither are individuals with expired work authorizations and dependents of people living in the U.S. under several visa classifications.
The excluded visa classes include O – ""extraordinary ability""; R – Religious worker; and F – student visas.
According to a1985memofrom the Department of Labor, ""an alien must be legally authorized to work in the United States to be considered ‘available for work’ – Therefore, an alien without current, valid authorization to work from the INS is not legally ‘available for work’ and not eligible for benefits.""
The memo referred to the INS, or Immigration and Naturalization Service, a predecessor entity to today’s Department of Homeland Security.

Elsewhere in the U.S., the Colorado Office of New Americans allows undocumented workers to access a ""Benefit Recovery Fund"" to help those who have been ""separated from employment through no fault of their own"" and meet several other specifications.
In California, however, Democrat lawmakers sought to offer assistance similar to that Saldaña is seeking but were blocked by fellow liberal Gov. Gavin Newsom.
Newsom vetoed that legislation in September and also blocked a proposal that would have allowed illegal immigrants better access to home loans and mortgages.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cap-trade-returns-ny-plans-force-big-oil-invest-green-paying-emissions,Cap-and-trade returns: NY plans to force big oil to ‘invest’ in ‘green’ by paying for emissions,"Fox News contributor David Webb joins 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the possible impact of New York's new law that will charge oil and gas companies $75 billion for their impact on climate change.
In her State of the State address Tuesday, New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul is expected to lay out her ""Cap & Invest"" anti-pollution program that critics warn will cause gasoline and utility costs to soar in the already fossil-fuel-averse state.
The plan seeks to reduce emissions by levying companies for their greenhouse gas outputs and investing that money into initiatives like retrofitting buildings to run on green electric power.
A ""cap"" refers to the limit of greenhouse gas emissions that is imposed by a state. The ""cap"" is often projected to decrease each year in order to meet climate change prevention goals.
The state then can set up an auction to let energy companies bid on pollution-weight-based ""allowances"" – the proceeds from which can be invested by the government in ""green"" initiatives, according toNew York Focus.
NY LAWMAKERS DEMAND SUBWAY CHIEF'S OUSTER AFTER COMMENTS DISMISSIVE OF CRIME AMID NEW TOLLS
New York drivers could see more pain at the pump from such a proposal, according to critics like the nonpartisan group Upstate United, which advocates for boosting upstate New York's economy.
The AAA average gas price in New York sits at $3.14/gallon – comparable to most of the surrounding states except Pennsylvania – which usually remains higher than the rest of the Northeast due to its nationally-third-highest gas tax.
A Hochul spokesman told theNew York Postthat the governor is ""focused on lowering the cost of living, putting money back in New Yorkers’ pockets with refunds, tax credits and more.""
Since Democrats took the executive reins from term-limited GOP Gov. George Pataki in 2007 and have held them without interruption, the Empire State has progressively restricted energy exploration in the state.
The trend began with Gov. David Paterson’s 2010 ""timeout"" on hydraulic fracturing for natural gas that effectively remains to this day.
The ""Marcellus Shale"" range is named for a town in New York – but any fracking activity since that time has occurredon the Pennsylvania end of the deposits.
State Sen. Tom O’Mara, R-Elmira, represents a district that sits on part of the Marcellus oil shale formation that remains untouchable under state policy.
Natural gas wells dot the countryside in neighboring Bradford and Tioga counties just to the south in Pennsylvania, but the landscape is clear of any signs of exploration to those traversing NY-17 through New York’s Southern Tier only a few miles away.

On Monday, O’Mara criticized what he called the latest ""radical climate mandate"" to be handed down:
""Gov. Hochul and the Albany Democrats are going to keep talking about addressing New York's affordability crisis. But it's clear that their actions like Cap and Invest, more aptly called 'Cap and Tax'… will only keep driving this state into the ground economically,"" he said.
In 2014, O’Mara slammed New York’s original decision to banfracking in his area, saying it ""eviscerates the hope of so many Southern Tier farmers, landowners, businesses and potential jobs in the natural gas industry.""
Hochul’s cap-and-tax plan, he said, will only increase the cost of doing business in New York and drive more families and employers out of the state while exacerbating the affordability crisis.
The plan shows the governor is out of touch with New Yorkers, Assembly Minority Leader William Barclay told Fox News Digital.
""The last thing we need is more unworkable environmental policy from Albany that drives costs up and drives residents away. Democrats constantly lecture us about the need for Cap and Invest and other misguided energy policy, but when people are paying more at the pump and can’t afford their heating bills, who benefits?"" asked Barclay, R-Oneida.
""It’s our responsibility to make sure New Yorkers have reliable, affordable energy sources – not force consumers to subsidize the green dreams of the liberal environmental lobby.""

In 2021, then-New York Gov.Andrew Cuomosuccessfully shuttered the massive 2,000MW Indian Point nuclear power generation plant on the Hudson River opposite Haverstraw.
Cuomo cited safety concerns at the time and said ""it does not belong… in close proximity to the most densely-populated area in the country."" Critics responded that that area cited – New York City – relied heavily on the power it generated and complained of increased utility bills.
A 2019 law commits New York to net-zero emissions by 2050, according to The New York Times.
Nationally, ""Cap & Trade"" first entered the American lexicon during the 2008 presidential campaign, when then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., wooed environmentalists with the idea of taxing entities that release greenhouse gases and affect the atmosphere.

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-can-make-government-tell-taxpayers-how-much-unions-cost-them,Trump can make government tell taxpayers how much unions cost them,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.
No one knows how much taxpayers spend on bargaining with federal labor unions, andPresident-elect Donald Trumpcan right that wrong. Building on reforms from his first administration and with support from the new Department of Government Efficiency, he could direct every federal agency to report how much it spends dealing with government labor unions, something no agency has ever done. Disclosure would provide transparency and accountability for the American people, who would surely be shocked to learn what the federal government is bargaining over and how much it costs.
As President Ronald Reagan’s first term director of theU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM),I saw firsthand how costly the federal collective bargaining process is to taxpayers — and how it’s almost entirely out of the public eye. Trump knows this is a problem, too, having issued an executive order in 2018 directing federal agencies to disclose union perks, which OPM calculated have $163 million annually.
Yet that executive order — which President Joe Biden rescinded immediately after taking office — was just a start. It’s even more important to examine what’s very likely a larger cost to taxpayers: How much thefederal bureaucracy spends negotiating with unions,managing union contracts and otherwise bargaining with unions in the federal workforce, which is over 1 million taxpayer-funded workers strong.
'GET BACK TO WORK': HOUSE OVERSIGHT TO TAKE ON GOVERNMENT TELEWORK IN 1ST HEARING OF NEW CONGRESS
To be sure, the union perks deserve attention. Most notably, union representatives often get to do union work like negotiating contracts or fighting disciplinary action on the taxpayer’s dime. Some federally paid workers spend 100% of their time doing union-related work, which means these public servants aren’t serving the public.

Unions also routinely get free or discounted access to federal property. At the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Salem, Virginia, a government union received half a hospital wing — more than 5,000 square feet, with a kitchen, private bathrooms and outdoor patio, mostly for the union president’s benefit.

Yet the cost of bargaining deserves just as much attention. What little information exists paints a picture of significant spending on picayune matters. Last fall, North Carolina Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, then-chairwoman of the House Committee on the Education and the Workforce, documented how government unions draw out negotiations with federal agencies.
That includes haggling over the height of cubicle desk panels, demanding designated smoking areas on tobacco-free federal property and recognizing employees’ right to wear spandex. Americans pay for every second that federal officials sit across from their union counterparts arguing about such issues, as well as all the related travel expenses, paperwork and legal hoop-jumping.
A new report from theInstitute for the American Worker,titled ""Transparency Needed in the Process of Federal Collective Bargaining,"" sheds further light on these costs. The institute sent Freedom of Information Act requests to 28 federal agencies seeking data on expenditures related to collective bargaining. Twenty-one responded, though none had complete records.

The Small Business Administration spent more than $6 million on salary for staff involved in collective bargaining in 2022 and 2023. The Department of Labor spent more than $1 million in travel-related costs. Considering there are hundreds of federal agencies, these numbers are a fraction of the total cost to taxpayers.
For the sake of taxpayers, the facts must come to light. Trump can deliver real transparency by requiring agencies to annually disclose how much they spend on federal collective bargaining and the impact of such spending on government efficiency and effectiveness. Americans deserve to know how much they pay for negotiations with unions over wearing spandex, smoking cigarettes, and everything else that has nothing to do with public service.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/major-push-protect-renew-trump-tax-cuts-launched-my-powerful-conservative-group,"Major push to protect, renew Trump tax cuts launched by powerful conservative group","Economist Steve Moore joins ‘Fox News Live’ to discuss the economic effects of extending the Trump-era tax cuts and proposes a possible flat tax for the United States.
FIRST ON FOX:A powerful, fiscally conservative political advocacy group is launching what it says is an eight-figure campaign to urge Congress ""to protect prosperity"" by renewing the sweeping tax cuts signed into law byPresident-elect Trumpduring his first administration.
Americans for Prosperity (AFP),the influential and deep-pocketed grassroots network founded by the billionaire Koch Brothers, is announcing that it's spending $20 million to launch a wide-ranging campaign to urge the extension of Trump's signature Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).
The campaign, which includes an ad blitz starting this week in all 50 states, was shared first with Fox News on Monday.
""Americans must unite and tell Washington now is not the time for higher taxes. By extending and improving the Trump tax cuts, we can make America more affordable, create greater opportunity, and reignite the American dream,"" the narrator in one of the AFP ads argues.
TRUMP DETAILS STRATEGY TO RENEW HIS TAX CUTS
The 2017 law revised thenation's tax codeand gave a financial break to nearly all taxpayers. Many of the provisions are scheduled to expire at the end of this year, which would likely result in a tax increase for many Americans if Congress is unable to pass legislation to extend the cuts.
AFP says Congress is ""facing a countdown to crisis that threatens the family budgets of virtually every American.""
The group also said that millions of Americans will pay an extra $1,500 or more next year in taxes if the cuts are not extended.
AFP President and CEO Emily Seidel, highlighting that her group worked alongside Trump to pass the tax cuts last decade, called them the most pro-growth tax reform in American history.
TRUMP, GOP SENATORS TO HUDDLE AT CAPITOL, WEIGH STRATEGY ON BUDGET, TAXES AND BORDER
""Renewing the TCJA must be a top priority so we can ensure this historic achievement continues to fuel decades of economic prosperity – and AFP is fully committed to mobilizing millions of people to ensure it gets done,"" Seidel told Fox News in a statement.
AFP Vice President of Government Affairs Akash Chougule argued that the expiration of the tax cuts would ""result in crippling tax increases for millions of families,"" but ""by extending and improving on the TCJA, we can make America more affordable, create greater opportunity, and reignite the American dream.""
The group, and its aligned political wing, has a wide-ranging grassroots network across the country that it touts has reached nearly 30 million voters the past two years.

AFP saysit will once again activate its grassroots army ""to ensure pro-growth tax reform is Congress’ top priority"" through ""calls to lawmakers, community phone banks, and 20,000 contacts at constituent doors planned in February alone.""
The group says its campaign will also include more than 1,000 meetings at congressional offices, in-district events with their activists, roundtables with job creators and ""shared testimonials from real American families and businesses who would suffer if Congress fails to renew the Trump tax cuts.""
Also being utilized: op-eds at the national and state levels, TV and radio interviews, direct mail efforts and AFP's highly visible podcast.
During his campaign last year to win back his old job in the White House, Trump repeatedly pledged to extend his tax cuts.

No Democrats voted for the original tax cuts, which passed when Republicans controlled both houses of Congress, as they do once again.
While GOP House and Senate leaders are prioritizing extending the tax cuts, the massive price tag for extending them, which would likely even further balloon the nation's $2 trillion deficit, is sparking divisions among congressional Republicans.

While AFP had its differences with Trump during his first administration, it was a major supporter of his tax cuts as well as his bipartisan criminal justice reform law.
But the group's political wing, which has long backed fiscally conservative causes and candidates, endorsed and supported Trump rival Nikki Haley in late 2023 as the 2024 GOP presidential nomination race got started. Haley was the last remaining rival to Trump, but after she ended her White House bid, AFP Action, the group's political, wing concentrated its political efforts on down-ballot races.

FIRST ON FOX:A select group of tech industry titans and venture capitalists will gather inWashington, D.C.,this week to welcome the incoming Trump administration and celebrate new opportunities for global innovation in artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship.
Presidents and CEOs from companies on the cutting edge of AI tech and their big financial backers, along with personnel from the incoming administration, will attend a dinner on Thursday organized by Outside the Box Ventures, a firm founded last year by journalist-turned-investment banker Katherine Tarbox, along with Laurent Bili, the French ambassador to the U.S.
The list of those invited to Thursday's dinner includes ""DOGE"" chiefElon Musk, Silicon Valley investor and GOP mega-donor Peter Thiel, NVCA chief executive Bobby Franklin, incoming White House AI and crypto czar David Sacks, OpenAI's Sam Altman, investor Joe Lonsdale and Narya co-founder Colin Greenspon.
""This gathering represents more than discussion. We hope it symbolizes a new chapter in public-private collaboration to harness technology’s transformative power for the nation’s future,"" a source close to the planning told Fox News Digital. The event comes days before President-elect Trump is inaugurated as the nation's 47th president.

America's leading entrepreneurs want to seize what Microsoft's Brad Smith has called a ""golden opportunity for American technology and economic competitiveness."" The aim is for the joined forces of industry leaders and government resources that Trump brought together for Operation Warp Speed, his first administration's lauded COVID-19 vaccine program, to be reproduced for advancements in AI.
The participation of Bili reflects how France is interested in being a leader in AI, with a global action summit on the rapidly developing technology to be held in Paris this February, and believes the U.S. is a valuable partner in this effort.
""We believe this is the hottest ticket for tech and venture capital up to the inauguration,"" the source said. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Franklin, the CEO of the National Venture Capital Association, the industry trade group for venture capital, confirmed he plans to attend. He told Fox News Digital there is great excitement in his industry for several of Trump's hires who have backgrounds in venture capital, including Sacks, a billionaire tech executive, and Vice President-elect JD Vance.

""One of our challenges is always educating, and there's always a lack of understanding of what the venture industry does, how it works with entrepreneurs, how it creates great tech and drugs and everything else in the economy,"" Franklin said. ""And so having folks that understand that coming into the administration is a wonderful, welcome situation from our perspective.""
The dinner comes at a critical juncture for the U.S., which leads the world inAI startupsbut faces tough competition from China and other foreign adversaries.
American companies received more than 40% of global AI funding in 2023, surpassing China and the European Union combined. That same year, U.S. venture capital firms unleashed $17.9 billion in funds for AI startups, contributing to the leaps and bounds in generative AI tech popularized by ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Grok from xAI.
More than 10,000 AI-related patents have been filed by U.S. entities in the past five years, showcasing the deep bench of American innovators that Franklin and others believe Trump stands ready to support.
NEW REPORT WARNS OF GROWING NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT TO US AS CHINA BUILDS AI: ‘SIGNIFICANT AND CONCERNING’

But analysts warn that China's recent developments in AI technology pose a challenge to American dominance in this field and may even threaten U.S. national and economic security.
A recent report published by American Edge Project cautions that ""China is rapidly advancing its own open-source ecosystem as an alternative to American technology and using it as a Trojan horse to implant its CCP values into global infrastructure.""
The report calledChina's progress""both significant and concerning.""
""Chinese-developed open-source AI tools are already outperforming Western models on key benchmarks, while operating at dramatically lower costs, accelerating global adoption. Through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which spans more than 155 countries on four continents, and its Digital Silk Road (DSR), China is exporting its technology worldwide, fostering increased global dependence, undermining democratic norms, and threatening U.S. leadership and global security.""
CRYPTO INDUSTRY CELEBRATES TRUMP APPOINTING DAVID SACKS AS AI, CRYPTO ‘CZAR’ TO LEAD INDUSTRY INNOVATION

There is a broad expectation that the Trump administration will let the private sector lead the way as the U.S. confronts China. Whereas the Biden administration prioritized establishing ""guardrails"" for AI development through regulatory bodies, analysts for Perkins Coie note that Trump has promised to revoke a Biden-era executive order that set policy for federal agency AI purchases and uses. The 2024 Republican platform claimed Biden's policy ""hinders innovation and imposes Radical Leftwing Ideas,"" apparently in reference to requirements that the National Institute of Standards and Technology create guidance to ensure AI models are unbiased and do not discriminate based on race or sex.
Additionally,Trump's appointment of Sacksas AI czar signals his thinking on AI is in line with Sacks' associates Musk and Thiel, who each co-founded PayPal and favor a deregulatory agenda.
""The new czar will likely be tasked with coordinating with federal agencies and outside stakeholders to ensure consistent guidance regarding AI use in the federal government. We would expect Sacks to be less focused on the potential harms of AI and more focused on promoting and facilitating AI innovation with fewer restraints,"" Perkins Coie said.

Thursday's gathering is a strictly nonpartisan event, thoughSilicon Valley's high interestin building relationships with a Republican administration would seem to signal shifting political priorities.
Previously, issues like immigration and climate change distanced Big Tech from the GOP. And when Trump first ran for president, his populist MAGA movement was an unknown factor that led many entrepreneurs to keep that distance.
But a growing recognition of AI as a national priority has appeared to bridge that gap. So has a more clearly defined Trump, with key players in his second administration that have ties to the venture capital world.
""You know, it was certainly a political outsider that won in 2016,"" Franklin said. ""Now, he's not an outsider.""

Jason Chaffetz scolds Biden's decision to pardon dozens of death penalty sentences and looks ahead to President-elect Trump's 'optimistic' transition.
As he leaves office next week,President Bidenwill primarily be remembered for his astounding incompetence. As a new generation of officeholders from both parties battles the devastating consequences of his failed leadership, his destructive impact on his own party, agenda and voters will cast a long shadow.
Among the myriad failures, five stand out as a cautionary tale for future leaders.
Even in the corrupt world of politics,Biden stood outfor his obvious lack of integrity. His administration will be synonymous with gaslighting and influence-peddling.

He lied about small things – like graduating in the top half of his law school class or leadership in the civil rights movement. He lied about personal things – like falsely claiming his son died in Iraq, and that members of his family were killed by a drunken driver.
WHY WE MUST EXPOSE THE CRIMINAL FRAUD OF THOSE BEHIND BIDEN'S DISASTROUS PRESIDENCY
He lied about blatantly obvious things, like inflation rates, student loan forgiveness and his promise not topardon his son’s many crimes. He lied about matters of global significance – like the border being secure, the Afghanistan withdrawal being a success, and his own direct involvement in his family’s influence peddling.
Nothing from his administration could be trusted – not even the jobs numbers.
He governed the way he campaigned in 2020 – from the figurative basement. We seldom saw him. He would occasionally choose to bloviate on some issue to propagate a narrative, but he seldom took questions.
THE THREAT FROM RADICAL ISLAM IS NOW INSIDE OUR GATES. BIDEN IGNORED IT. TRUMP MUST ACT
He rarely interacted with the media and when he did, it was with a pre-scripted select few. Hisincessant vacationsrarely appeared to involve any actual work. He demonstrated little familiarity with facts.
It is unclear to what degree he was even engaged in making decisions. He spent roughly 40% of his time away from the White House.
He failed on the basic principles of presidential leadership. Our enemies did not fear us. Our allies took advantage of us. Our bureaucracy was weaponized against us.
BIDEN KEEPS INSULTING AMERICANS WITH LAST MINUTE MOVES. REPUBLICANS CAN STOP IT
Biden made no attempt to bridge political divides. The justification for his candidacy was his knowledge of Washington andhis promise to unite. There is no evidence any success bringing the country together.
Rather than laying the groundwork for a prosperous future, he spent his political capital going after his political opposition. Most destructive to his party was his failure to lay the groundwork for a new generation of Democratic leadership.

In a petty effort to sabotage his successor, Biden has locked in regulations that prevent offshore drilling, commit the United States tocostly climate initiatives, obligate us in long-term international conflicts, flood the country will millions who are here illegally, and embed loyalists in the bureaucracy while ensuring many didn’t need to come into the office in the next five years. These efforts not only undermine the future administration, they undermine American prosperity.

In comments on a Bloomberg podcast, MTA Chairman Janno Lieber argued thatcrime on the MTAhas declined and that the recent viral incidents are giving an impression of a system-wide safety crisis.
""The overall stats are positive. Last year, we [had] actually 12.5% less crime than 2019 . . . , "" he said.

New York’s new $9 toll to enter any part of Manhattan below Central Park has enraged commuters, as well as residents within its bounds.
Commuters from Long Island found themselves bottlenecked in trying to access the last unaffected entry to Manhattan – the Upper Level of the Queensboro Bridge.
One East Side luxury building's exit also unintentionally forced residents through a toll gantry, even if they are trying to go uptown; away from the zone, while outer neighborhoods braced for a deluge of suburbanites looking for parking to avoid the toll.
New York Senate Deputy Minority Leader Andrew Lanza, R-Staten Island, torched Lieber:
""Janno: pull your head out of your piles of statistics, get out from behind your computer, and walk a mile in your riders’ shoes before you ignore, dismiss and insult them,"" Lanza said.
""The people of this state and city deserve the truth and real solutions, not eggheads trying to convince themselves they’re doing a good job.""
Sen. Bill Weber of Valley Cottage added: ""Albany Democrats claim congestion pricing is to reduce traffic congestion, but at what cost? It punishes everyday people—working parents, firefighters, seniors going to doctor's appointments, and those who already struggle to make ends meet.""
""For them, this isn’t just a toll; it’s another obstacle in their daily lives. Tell me, how is that progressive?"" he asked.
Sen. Steve Rhoads of Nassau previously quipped that the MTA’s acronym stands for ""Money Thrown Away"" and said this week that his constituents who rely on trains like the LIRR have grown distrustful of the agency.

Lieber was previously an executive at Silverstein Properties — recently overseeing a World Trade Center project — a transportation adviser to President Bill Clinton and Mayor Ed Koch, and a journalist for the New Republic.
He was also the MTA’s capital development officer under Gov. Andrew Cuomo.
Cuomo, who still strongly supports the congestion pricing plan, recently told Fox News Digital through a spokesman that he, however, has reservations about whether now is the right time to activate the tolls – given the lack of confidence in subway safety and changes in the city since the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It is undeniable that New York is in a dramatically different place today than it was in 2019, and without a study forecasting its consequences based on facts, not politics, it could do more harm than good to New York City's recovery,"" Cuomo spokesman Rich Azzopardi said last week.
State Sen. Alexis Weik, R-Suffolk, called the video of Lieber’s Broadway sign-reveal ""a despicable show of glee and greed"" and called for a financial review board to scrutinize the transit agency’s books.
In response to the slew of calls for Lieber's ouster, MTA Chief of Policy & External Relations John J. McCarthy defended the transit boss.
""Under Chair Lieber’s leadership, the MTA has added service, opened new terminals and provided record on-time performance for their constituents on Long Island and the Hudson Valley, while delivering the most reliable subway service in a dozen years,"" McCarthy said.
""But apparently, none of that prevents out-of-touch politicians from bloviating.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/berkeley-professor-i-see-impact-h-1b-visas-ai-have-students-job-opportunities,"As a Berkeley professor, I see the impact H-1B visas and AI have on students' job opportunities","American Majority founder and CEO Ned Ryun joins 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to discuss Republicans divided over H-1B visas and Vivek Ramaswamy's comments calling out U.S. culture of 'mediocrity'.
TheH-1B visa programwas intended to bring in specialized talent from abroad, but instead it has become a tool for employers to hire lower-cost labor for ordinary jobs.
The result is a distorted job market, where highly skilled workers are being squeezed out of the H-1B visa program by spam applications for ordinary workers who then take entry-level positions that are already in short supply. This misuse of H-1B visas has a negative synergy with growingimpact of AI on the job marketand is part of a larger problem that urgently needs attention.
The impact of this visa-farming problem is particularly acute among young people and recent college graduates, who face a bleak job market despite moderate overall unemployment rates. According to government data, the ratio of unemployment for college grads under 25 to those over 25 has hit an all-time high of more than four to one. This means that entry-level jobs are already four times more scarce than jobs requiring experience or advanced expertise.
Program applicants explicitly should be people with specialized skills, and those specialized skills should not be readily available fromexisting resident workers.
I have seen firsthand the symptoms of decreasing demand forentry-level tech jobs. These symptoms include fewer job notices from recruiters targeting fresh CS grads, job fairs with fewer companies, and concerned advisees getting fewer offers with lower pay or in some cases not getting any offers at all. Awarding the H-1B visas to low-paid, non-specialist workers only exacerbates this scarcity while doing little to fill the actual demand for workers with specialist skills.
H-1B VISAS HURT ONE TYPE OF WORKER AND EXPLOIT ANOTHER. THIS MESS MUST BE FIXED
The problem here is not about the number of visas issued, but rather how they're being used. Program applicants explicitly should be people with specialized skills, and those specialized skills should not be readily available fromexisting resident workers. However, the bureaucratic review process allows employers to exaggerate claims and hire workers with ordinary skills at low wages. There is an entire sub-profession of HR staff and attorneys that specialize in dressing up pigeons to look like peacocks.
This abuse of the application process has created a lottery system where workers with the needed special skills often lose out to those who don't have any specialized skills. As a result, recent graduates are finding it harder to get entry-level work, while at the same time companies that really need specific specialized skills can't get visas for those workers. Imagine a person who is suffering from both malnutrition and diabetes because instead of vitamins, they have been gobbling sugar pills.
I want to emphasize that I'm not advocating for insular restrictions on thenumber of H-1B visas. The issue is about ensuring that people with real specialized skills that are actually needed are being welcomed through the H-1B program. When used properly, an H-1B visa brings in someone who supplements the workforce with skills that are both needed and specialized, potentially benefiting the whole country. Whether it’s retaining a graduating international student or bringing in someone from outside the country, the U.S. has historically benefited immensely from immigrants with needed skills.
Many people who are invested in visa farming insist unconvincingly that the H-1B visas are already going to specialized workers as intended, but the statistics on H-1B visa recipients don't agree.
TRUMP SAYS HE'S NOT CHANGED HIS MIND ON H-1B VISAS AS DEBATE RAGES WITHIN MAGA COALITION
According to the annual report from the U.S. government's Office of Citizenship and Immigration Services, nearly 63,000 of the 2023 H-1B visa recipients were in ""Computer-Related Occupations"" and the median salary for this group was $99,000 per year with 25% of them earning less than $85,000. A salary of $99,000 or $85,000 per year is certainly a good amount to be earning, but it is quite low for what I would expect someone with rare specialized skills in this field to be earning.
One would think that people with specialized, hard-to-find skills would earn exceptionally good salaries, but instead these data show the opposite. In fact, the more I dig into the data in the agency's annual report, the less it appears that approved applications are for exceptional people for specialized jobs. It looks more like somespecially skilled workersmixed in with a lot of regular workers who are being paid on the low end of what I'd expect.
These observations are consistent with my own experiences in hiring tech workers and advising CS students, what has been related to me first hand by others, and numerous recently published analyses. The only clear explanation I see for these inconsistencies is that employers are submitting entry-level positions, not ones requiring special rare skills, that even for entry-level the salaries are low, and that those non-conforming applications are not being rejected.
Looking at the bigger picture, misuse of H-1B visas is not the only obstacle that U.S. job seekers face because AI automation is also eliminating jobs, compounding scarcity. Currently, the impact of AI is disproportionately on entry-level jobs, which exacerbates the problems caused by abuse of the H-1B program. However, AI will continue to improve, both in capability and ease of use, and its impact on the job market will grow as the range of tasks that can be done by AI expands.
MAGA’S H-1B ‘CIVIL WAR’ IS EXACTLY HOW POLITICS IS SUPPOSED TO WORK
While AI and H-1B visa abuse may appear to be distinct problems, they interact in a way that most people don't appreciate. Even when it can't totally replace a human worker,AI facilitates moving workaway from regular employees to contractors or remote workers.
The explanation is that AI often removes the need for an advanced specialized skill or knowledge, and replaces it with a lesser requirement of only needing the ability to review work for correctness. The result is that tasks which previously were too complex for moving to contractors or remote workers now become simpler due to AI and more suitable for externalizing.
As AI technology continues to improve employers will find that more and more jobs can be done by less-skilled workers, and there will be increased motivation to use H-1B visas for hiring those less-skilled workers cheaply.
The review process for the H-1B visa program needs to be reformed to prioritize applicants with real specialized talents and to ensure that recipients don't unfairly compete with workers already in the U.S. We must also address the growing threat of AI automation and its growing impact on the job market.

Roughly 90% all ofU.S. tax revenuecomes from taxing the income of working individuals, so if unemployment continues to expand then tax revenue will dramatically shrink. At the same time, the number of unemployed people needing public assistance needs will skyrocket. That combination doesn't work mathematically and is a clear recipe for disaster.
This situation demands radical change to avoid a dystopian future. Overall unemployment numbers may appear robust, but high levels of entry-level unemployment and overall underemployment indicate that a much bigger problem is developing.

Leaders in the tech industry are urging the Biden administration not to add a new regulation that will limit artificial intelligence exports, citing concerns it is overbroad and could diminish the United States' global dominance in AI.
The new rule, which industry leaders say could come as early as the end of this week, effectively seeks to shore up the U.S. economy and national security efforts by adding new restrictions on how many U.S.-madeartifical intelligenceproducts can be deployed across the globe.
""A rule of this nature would cede the global market to U.S. competitors who will be eager to fill the untapped demand created by placing arbitrary constraints on U.S. companies' ability to sell basic computing systems overseas,"" stated a Monday letter from Jason Oxman, the president and CEO of the Information Technology Industry Council (ITI), sent to Commerce Department Secretary Gina Raimondo. ""Should the U.S. lose its advantage in the global AI ecosystem, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to regain in the future.""
FBI'S NEW WARNING ABOUT AI-DRIVEN SCAMS THAT ARE AFTER YOUR CASH
The process to place new export controls on artificial intelligence goes back to October 2022, when the Biden administration's Commerce Department first released an updated export framework aimed at slowing the progress of Chinese military programs. Details of the new incoming export controls surfaced after the Biden administration called on American tech companyNVIDIAto stop selling certain computer chips toChinathe following month.

In an update to the rule the following year, the Biden administration announced the initiation of a public notice and comment period. Finally, last month, as the president's term in the White House winds down, the administration published two new updates to the rule that added more limits to the proposed export controls. The rule is now in its final stages before it will be formally published in the Federal Register.
""The Bureau of Industry and Security’s ('BIS') proposed Interim Final Rule ('IFR') is a highly complex and wildly overbroad attempt to regulate Artificial Intelligence and GPUs in the name of national security,"" Ken Glueck, the executive vice president atOracle, wrote in a blog post Sunday that was published to his company's website.
""For over half a century, bipartisan consensus has held that the best way to achieve U.S. technological leadership is to regulate technologywith a light touch. As a result, American companies have continued to lead each successive generation of technology, from the personal computer to the Internet, to mobile, to the cloud, and now Artificial Intelligence.""
In addition to fears that thenew regulationswill stifle economic growth in the domestic AI sector, some critics have also argued that blocking American AI manufacturers from selling their computer chips around the globe could actually benefit China.
WHITE HOUSE UNVEILS AI EXECUTIVE ORDER, REQUIRING COMPANIES TO SHARE NATIONAL SECURITY RISKS WITH FEDS
""The Biden administration is trying to force other countries to pick a side – the United States or China – and it is likely going to discover that if it issues this ultimatum, many will pick China,"" Stephen Ezell, vice president of global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said in a Tuesday statement published on the foundation's website.
""Moreover, the United States should be countering efforts by China and Russia, which recently launched anAI Alliance Networkamong BRICS countries, to offer its own allies and partners access to AI data, models, and computer resources,"" he added.
Experts warn of dire consequences for America should China surpass the U.S. in its technological capability.
Ezell and others also highlighted the rushed nature of the new proposed rule on export controls, arguing that hurrying to get it finalized has been at the cost of adequate industry input on the new regulations.
""We respectfully caution against making such a swift and significant shift in policy during this transitional period, and without meaningful consultation with industry,"" the Semiconductor Industry Association said in a Monday statement. The group encouraged the Biden administration to ""hand over the policymaking process"" to theincoming Trump administrationbecause it will ""ensure there is appropriate opportunity for government and industry leaders, together with our global partners, to thoughtfully address this critical matter.""
EXPERTS PRAISE LONG-AWAITED AI REPORT FROM CONGRESS: ‘A THOUGHTFUL AND FORWARD THINKING FRAMEWORK’
It is uncertain exactly how the incoming administration might approach this issue. Trump has signaled he is not afraid to initiate new trade deals and could potentially use the export controls as leverage.
However, the president-elect said following his November election victory that a focus of his second term will be to ""win the A.I. arms race with China (and others).""

Rampell dismantled multiple instances of praise that pundits ""lavished"" on Biden. She listed them, stating, ""When Biden entered office, commentators lavished him with grand historical parallels.

This mess must be fixed,"'Fox & Friends' co-hosts weigh in on the debate over H-1B visas, which allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers for specialty jobs, after Elon Musk and President-elect Trump expressed support for the program.
We are living in a moment with unprecedented income and wealth inequality.  At a time when the richest people in our country have never had it so good, 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and inflation-adjusted income for the average American worker has been stagnant for 50 years. Why is that?
How did it happen that the three richest men in America own more wealth than the bottom half of our society while so many of our people struggle to afford thehigh cost of rent, groceries and other basic necessities of life?
It's time to take a hard look at some of the economic policies which have made the rich much richer while many Americans continue to fall further and further behind.
BERNIE SANDERS HITS OUT AT H-1B VISA PROGRAM FOR REPLACING AMERICAN JOBS WITH 'INDENTURED SERVANTS'
Thirty years ago, the leaders of corporate America, the political establishment in both major parties and the editorial boards of influential newspapers told us not to worry about the loss of blue-collar manufacturing jobs that would come as a result of unfetteredfree trade agreementslike NAFTA and Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China (PNTR). They promised that those lost jobs would be more than offset by the many good-paying, white-collar information technology jobs that would be created in the United States.  I never believed that and voted against those agreements.
Unfortunately, I, and the many others who opposed those trade deals, were proven correct. NAFTA and PNTR cost us millions of good-paying manufacturing jobs as large corporations shut down thousands of factories in America and fled to China, Mexico, and other low-wage countries in search of cheap labor.
And what about all of the great high-tech jobs that would be created?  Well, that didn't quite happen either.  As a result of the H-1B guest worker program, major corporations are now importing hundreds of thousands of low-paid guest workers from abroad to fill thewhite-collar technology jobsthat are available.  In other words, ""Heads billionaires win. Tails American workers lose.""
In recent weeks, the H-1B program has sparked intense debate. Billionaires likeElon Muskclaim it is crucial to our economy, arguing that the United States faces a shortage of highly skilled engineers and technology professionals. They are dead wrong.
The primary purpose of H-1B and other guest worker programs is not to employ the ""best and the brightest,"" but instead to replace American workers with lower-paid workers from abroad who often live as indentured servants.  The cheaper it is to hire guest workers, the more money the multi-billionaire owners of large corporations make.
SEN BERNIE SANDERS: TWO AMERICAS, THE PEOPLE VS. THE BILLIONAIRES
Not only is this program disastrous for American workers, it can be very harmful to guest workers as well, who are often locked into lower-paying jobs and can have their visas taken away from them by their corporate bosses if they complain about dangerous, unfair or illegal working conditions.
Between 2022 and 2023, the top companies using the H-1B program laid off 85,000 American workers, while simultaneously bringing in over 34,000 guest workers from abroad. Meanwhile, millions of Americans with advanced degrees in STEM fields are unable to find work in their areas of expertise.
If there is truly a major shortage of skilled tech workers in this country, why did Tesla lay-off over 7,500 American workers last year – including many software developers and engineers at its factory inAustin, Texas– while applying to hire thousands of H-1B guest workers?
If these jobs are only going to ""the best and brightest,"" why has Tesla employed H-1B guest workers asassociate accountantsfor as little as $58,000,associate mechanical engineersfor as little as $70,000 a year, andassociate material plannersfor as little as $80,000 a year? Those don’t sound like highly specialized jobs that are for the top 0.1 percent, as Musk claimed last month. Musk has failed to address concerns about Tesla's use of H-1B visas for its employees.

If this program is really supposed to be about importing workers with highly advanced degrees in science and technology, why are H-1B guest workers being employed aslawyers,dog trainers,massage therapists,cooks, andEnglish teachers? Can we really not find English teachers in America?  Do we really believe that we are facing a dire shortage of lawyers in our country?
Let’s be clear. To the extent that there may be labor shortages in our country in some highly specialized areas that need to be filled by employees from abroad through the H-1B program, we need to make sure that this program is used as a short-term fix.
Long-term, if the United States is going to succeed in ahighly competitive global economy, we must have the best-educated workforce in the world.
And one way to help make that happen is to substantially increase the guest worker fees large corporations pay to fund scholarships, apprenticeships, and job training opportunities for American workers. This is something that I have advocated from my first days as a U.S. senator.
Further, we must also significantly raise the minimum wage for guest workers, give them the freedom to easily switch jobs and require corporations to aggressively recruit American workers first before they can hire workers from overseas. The widespread corporate abuse of the H-1B program must be ended.
Multi-billionaire oligarchs in Big Tech should not be allowed to hire guest workers to fill entry-level and mid-level Information Technology jobs.  Those jobs should be going to American workers who have theConstitutional rightto form a union and collectively bargain for better wages, benefits and working conditions.
It must never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker.
Mr. Musk, Mr. Ramaswamy, and others have argued that we need a highly skilled and well-educated workforce. They are right. But the answer, however, is not to bring in cheap labor from abroad.
CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP
The answer is to hire qualified American workers first and to make certain that we have an education system that produces the kind of workforce that our country needs for the jobs of the future. And that’s not just engineering. We are in desperate need of more doctors, nurses, dentists, teachers, electricians, plumbers, and a host of other professions.
Bottom line: We need an economy that works for all, not just the few. And one way we do that is to bring about major reforms in the H-1B program and other fatally flawed guest worker programs.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/subway-mayhem-spurs-cuomo-urge-halt-new-nyc-driving-tax,Subway mayhem spurs Cuomo to urge halt to new NYC driving tax,"Incoming border czar Tom Homan joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss his reaction.
As New York’s ""congestion pricing"" inner-city tolling plan takes effect Sunday, one of its major proponents is questioning whether the timing is right for a policy meant to drive people to an increasingly dangerous mass transit system.
Through a spokesman, formerGov. Andrew Cuomoconfirmed that he still backs the system that now tolls drivers $9 to cross below Central Park or enter Lower Manhattan from Brooklyn and New Jersey – but questioned whether now is best to implement it.
""Governor Cuomo believes congestion pricing is ultimately the right policy, which is why he fought and succeeded in passing it after more than a decade of failed attempts,"" longtime spokesman Rich Azzopardi told Fox News Digital on Friday.
Azzopardi said that Cuomo’s original plan, which found agreement from then-Mayor Bill de Blasio, was based on a ""safe and reliable subway system"" and a thriving city core. Prior Mayor Michael Bloomberg had proposed a similar plan in 2007, but it died in Albany.
HOCHUL SPARKS BIPARTISAN OUTRAGE OVER CONGESTION PRICING REBOOT AS DEMS WORRY TRUMP WILL BLOCK
Cuomo, Hochul(AP File)
""[G]iven the obvious lack of confidence the public currently has in the subway system – combined with the tenuous state of New York City post-COVID, [Cuomo] called for a data-driven study on the impact of congestion pricing to inform the timing of such a major policy change and to ensure New York was not creating additional obstacles to its comeback.""
Cuomo previously wrote in aMarch op-edthat congestion pricing’s success hinges on confidence in the MTA and mass transit, which he noted has also statistically still not recovered from COVID levels.
He noted how congestion pricing is meant to ""incentivize"" subway use – but that that is hard to do when people are getting brutally attacked underground – and noted that it was his father, Gov. Mario Cuomo, who first beefed-up police presence after the ""bad old days.""
At the time of a prior column in the Post, Cuomo cited a conductor with 24 years of service to the MTA vowing never to go back underground after he was slashed in the neck and required 34 stitches while operating an A train in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.

More recently, an Ocean County, N.J., woman was burned alive in Coney Island, and there have been several near-fatal cases of people being randomly shoved in front of trains, occurring from Morningside Heights to TriBeCa, since Christmas.
""It is undeniable that New York is in a dramatically different place today than it was in 2019, and without a study forecasting its consequences based on facts, not politics, it could do more harm than good to New York City's recovery,"" Cuomo’s spokesman said Friday.
But Cuomo’s onetime deputy,Gov. Kathy Hochul,appeared full-steam-ahead in enacting the policy, which is intended to drive commuters and residents to consider mass transit to head to work or play in Midtown.
FEDERAL JUDGE RULES ON NYC CONGESTION PRICING
In a recent statement lauding her current plan, Hochul’s office said the reduction of the congestion toll from its original $15 will save drivers $1,500 per year, and that commuters will see ""new and improved subway services.""
""By getting congestion pricing underway and fully supporting the MTA capital plan, we’ll unclog our streets, reduce pollution and deliver better public transit for millions of New Yorkers,"" Hochul said.
MTA Chairman Janno Lieber, who oversees the state-run metro subway, bus and rail network, said that Hochul is ""stepping up"" for people who want cleaner air, safer streets and less gridlock.

He also noted that upgrades have already taken place on the 7 subway from Times Square to Flushing, Queens, and the L train from Union Square to Canarsie.
However, Cuomo’s camp maintains that it was he who envisioned and oversaw the upgrades to New York’s transit network without the added tolls in effect – and ripped Hochul and Lieber for claiming that he had gotten cold feet.
When theNew York Post asked Hochulfor comment on Cuomo suggesting she ""hit the brakes"" on congestion pricing, the governor directed comment to a Lieber spokesman, who blasted Cuomo for ""flip-flopping.""
""What would really harm New York’s continuing recovery is starving subways of a desperately needed source of funding after decades of underinvestment,"" the MTA’s Aaron Donovan said.
""The $15 fee was passed by the MTA under Hochul’s watch, but please gaslight away,"" Azzopardi told Fox News Digital. ""New Yorkers aren’t stupid.""
Cuomo previously told WNYW that people have the option to work from home, which they didn’t have when he first pushed the plan in 2019 – and that if he were a commuter, he would likely balk at the idea of added costs at a time of ""high crime and homelessness.""
Cuomo’s camp also said thatHochul likesto take credit for the achievements of his three-term administration that presaged the new tolls.
""The difference here is that Governor Cuomo built the [new Amtrak/MetroNorth] Moynihan Train Hall and the Second Avenue Subway [extension to East Harlem], as well as fixed the L train and did the hard work to get [Grand Central’s] East Side Access and the LIRR Third-Track done. All Hochul wanted to do was cut the ribbons,"" Azzopardi said.

Cuomo’s calls for a pause were joined by several New York Republicans, yet the former governor and potential 2025 mayoral candidate remains supportive of congestion pricing, while the GOP wants it nixed entirely.
Commuters from New Jersey must still pay Port Authority tolls to cross the Hudson River, and outer-borough commuters the same via the East River – albeit with a slight credit toward their ""congestion"" fee.
Drivers who remain on the FDR Drive or Joe DiMaggio West Side Highway will not be charged unless they turn onto surface streets.

One social scientist and author told CNN that he's worried about the number of men in their 30s and 40s who are not buying homes or starting families.
""Of Boys and Men"" author Richard Reeves spoke to CNN host Michael Smerconish about the brewing social dynamic in America where a significant portion of men are not reaching the standards of adulthood that their parents did, including owning a home or having kids.
""It speaks to a change, an important change, which is the fact that these milestones aren‘t just being reached later, but for many people, they‘re not being reached at all,"" Reeves told Smerconish, commenting on a recentWall Street Journal articlediscussing this trend.
""And right now it looks like it‘s the economic and social prospects of young men that are the big issue facing us,"" he would go on to say.
THIS EPIDEMIC IS AMERICA'S MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS CHALLENGE
Author Richard Reeves speaks to CNN about the growing number of men not able to reach traditional milestones of adulthood in America.(Screenshot/CNN)
Citing the most concerning data he has seen, Reeves said, ""Yeah, for me, it‘s the fact that men in their 30s and 40s now, who don‘t have a college degree, half of them don‘t have children in their home.""
Reeves, who is also president of theAmerican Institute for Boys and Men, noted that the new dynamic is that, rather than men just waiting later to reach these milestones, they’re not reaching them at all, and that’s worrying.
""Taking a bit more time to get educated, take your time to form a family, maybe get yourself financially settled – that‘s arguably a good thing, but that‘s not what‘s happening now. What‘s happening now is that these milestones for many people are just not being reached at all.""
Elsewhere, he said, ""Honestly, Michael, I didn‘t used to worry about this delay. I‘m now worried about it because I do think we’re moving from, ‘This is just happening later,’ to, ‘It‘s just not happening.’""
Furthermore, he noted that men aren’t necessarily choosing to forego these achievements, they feel as though they’re unable to reach them. ""The data suggests that actually, men in particular, still want to have children, they still want to get married, they still want to form families. It‘s just that, for some reason, they‘re not able to.""

""It‘s a mixture, as always, of economics and culture. This is partly just, you know, young men in particular feeling like they‘re not doing as well economically as they need to,"" Reeves said, adding that thecurrent gender dividein society is adding to this problem.
""A third of men under 30 are not dating. 24% of men still living at home in their 20s, as you just pointed out.""
The expert then pointed out where to start addressing this problem. ""We‘ve got to improve the economic prospects for young men – that is, if you‘re going to do one thing. So, we need to have more investments in an education system that works for men,"" he said, mentioning promoting vocational training, apprenticeships, and combating flatlining male wages.

2025 is here, and after diet and exercise,money and paying off debtare always at the top of the list for Americans' New Year’s resolutions. How can you make a game plan that’s actionable and tactical on January 1? Here are five great ideas to get the new year off to a bang!
Did you know the average person visits the grocery store more than 10 times a month? According toOxygen Financial, that adds up to a significant chunk of your time. And with each trip taking an average of 43 minutes (source: Time Institute), the hours really add up. And remember this, the grocery stores have the same goal as the casinos in Las Vegas, which is to separate you from your wallet.
In fact, right near me in Atlanta, Ga., a Publix recently opened with a full bar where you can drink beer and wine. Now, why would you need to do that? The reason is that grocery stores know it's paramount to get you to spend more time in the store and, consequently, you’ll spend more money.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bernie-sanders-hits-out-h-1b-visa-program-replacing-american-jobs-indentured-servants,Bernie Sanders hits out at H-1B visa program for replacing American jobs with 'indentured servants',"Columnist David Marcus joins ‘FOX & Friends’ to discuss the disagreement over H-1B visas after Elon Musk and President-elect Trump expressed support.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.,is taking aim at the controversial H-1B visa program, arguing that it replaces ""good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad"" — just as the program is at the center of a debate within the Republican Party.
""The main function of the H-1B visa program and other guest worker initiatives is not to hire ‘the best and the brightest,’ but rather to replace good-paying American jobs with low-wage indentured servants from abroad,"" Sanders wrote on X. ""The cheaper the labor they hire, the more money the billionaires make.""
Theself-described democratic socialisthas a history of opposing the program, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers for specialty occupations. It is predominantly used by the tech industry, but has faced criticism mainly from the right that it brings in cheap labor from abroad to replace American workers.

The program recently became part of an intra-Republican debate whenElon Muskand Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been tapped by Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, argued for the importance of foreign workers for tech companies.
""The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX,Tesla,and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,"" Musk said on X.
That reopened a rift between those on the right over the program and whether it is being used to attract the best talent or being used by companies to bring in cheaper labor, primarily from India, who are tied to their job by the visa.
Sanders cited statistics to show that in 2022 and 2023, the top 30 corporations using the program laid off over 85,000 American workers, while hiring over 34,000 H-1B workers, and that 33% of new IT jobs are filled by foreign national guest workers. He also pointed to layoffs at Tesla, one of Musk’s companies.

""If this program is really supposed to be about importing workers with highly advanced degrees in science and technology, why are H-1B guest workers being employed as dog trainers, massage therapists, cooks, and English teachers?"" he said. ""Can we really not find English teachers in America?""
Sanders conceded that there may be labor shortages that could be filled byH-1B workers, but he called for substantially increased guest worker fees in order to pay for opportunities for Americans, as well as other reforms, including increased minimum wages and the ability to easily move jobs.
""Bottom line. It should never be cheaper for a corporation to hire a guest worker from overseas than an American worker,"" he said.
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO CHANGE H-1B GUEST WORKER PROGRAM TO PRIORITIZE HIGHER-WAGE APPLICANTS
Sanders said that the ""economic elite and political establishments"" promised in the 1990s that a loss of blue-collar jobs due to free trade agreements would be offset by more white-collar IT jobs.
""Well, that turned out to be a Big Lie. Not only have corporations exported millions of blue-collarmanufacturing jobs to China, Mexico, and other low-wage countries, they are now importing hundreds of thousands of low-paid guest workers from abroad to fill the white-collar technology jobs that are available,"" he said.

Sanders comments come days afterPresident-elect Trump, who had railed against H-1B abuse during the 2016 campaign, said that he has always supported the program.
""I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program,"" he told the New York Post.

Americans flocked to southern states in 2024, according to U-Haul's Growth Index, withSouth Carolinatopping the list of moving destinations for the first time.
Arrivals accounted for 51.7% of all one-way U-Haul traffic in and out of the state, according tothe reportpublished Thursday.
Texas, which reigned as the top U-Haul growth state three years in a row, fell to second place last year. North Carolina ranked third.
""The Carolinas are a great place to live,"" said Jason Hardin, U-Haul's area vice president for the Carolinas and Georgia. ""We have southern charm. We have a lot of history here. We got beaches. We have mountains. We have low cost of living.""

The outlook was less sunny in the Golden State, which ranked dead last on U-Haul's Growth Index for the fifth year in a row.
U-Haul calculates each state's net gain (or loss) of customers using one-way rentals. The company said it sees more than 2.5 million one-way truck, trailer and moving container transactions each year across all 50 states.
Transactions from 2024 ""reaffirm customer tendencies that have been pronounced for some time,"" U-Haul International president John ""J.T."" Taylor said in a statement.
""Migration to the Southeast and Southwest continues as families gauge their cost of living, job opportunities, quality of life and other factors,"" Taylor said in the statement. ""Out-migration remains prevalent for a number of markets across the Northeast, Midwest and West Coast — and particularly California.""
Florida and Tennessee ranked fourth and fifth, respectively, among the leading growth states. Arizona, Washington, Indiana, Utahand Idahorounded out the top 10.

U-Haul rankings don't correlate directly to population or economic growth — after three years of decline,California's populationgrew last year, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates.
However, the company says its Growth Index offers a look at how well states and cities are attracting and retaining residents.
Hardin said many of the people he sees moving to the Carolinas are coming from the Northeast seeking warmer weather, and from California in search of a lower cost of living.
""There's no reason you wouldn't want to move here,"" Hardin added in a video shared by U-Haul.
Hardin also highlighted the Carolinas' abundance of entertainment and sports opportunities, as well as a surge in manufacturing, healthcare and tech jobs.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/washington-state-democrats-accidentally-email-radical-tax-plan-entire-senate,Washington state Democrats accidentally email their 'radical' tax plan to entire Senate,"Salon owner Zazel Wu joins ‘Fox News @ Night’ to discuss how Seattle’s homelessness and drug problems has impacted the community.
Washington state Democrats appeared to have accidentally emailed their sweeping revenue plans and internal talking points on tax hikes to the entirety of the upper chamber's members in Olympia, Fox News has learned.
Property tax hikesand a new double-digit tax on firearms are among proposals Washington state Democrats are considering, according to materials originally disseminated to all members by Washington Senate Deputy Floor Leader Noel Frame, D-Seattle, in late December and later obtained by Fox News Digital.
A document titled ""2025 Revenue Options"" and a PowerPoint presentation describing how to talk to constituents in defense of the plan were included in the messages.
The document lists proposed figures for an 11% tax onammunition and firearms, reclassifying storage unit rentals as a retail transaction and a lift on the property tax levy lid for certain Washingtonians.
A PowerPoint slide, highlighted by Seattle radio host Jason Rantz, described the ""Best way to talk taxes"" — with a chart of do’s and don’ts for lawmakers.
DEMOCRAT ATTORNEYS GENERAL PREPARE FOR LEGAL BATTLES WITH TRUMP
Do say: ""Pay what they owe"" — but Don’t say: ""Tax the rich"" or ""pay their fair share"" because ""taxes aren’t a punishment,"" the graph read.
It also suggested using the terms ""funding,"" ""providing"" and ""ensuring"" when describing the apparent benefits of tax hikes, rather than the term ""investing in [X].""
""Avoid centering the tax or talking in vague terms about ‘the economy’ or ‘education.’""
One of the new proposals is that of a ""capital assets ownership tax.""
It is described assimilar to property taxes, but instead would extend the real estate-type tax to holdings in stocks, bonds and other financial instruments.
""We can ensure that extremely wealthy Washingtonians are taxed on their assets just like middle-class families are already taxed on theirs,"" the slide reads.
Another line directs lawmakers to proverbially ""identify the villain"" that is blocking ""progress"" and lay out ""how we can take action to solve the issue.""
""We have an upside-down tax code that benefits big corporations and the wealthiest few, that was written 100 years ago and desperately needs an update for the 21st century. If weensure Washington’s wealthiest paywhat they truly owe in taxes, the rest of us will have what we need — like affordable health care, housing, and food.""
FLASHBACK: NYPD WARNS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS THAT A ‘SEATTLE-STYLE OCCUPATION ZONE’ WON'T BE TOLERATED
Rantz said in a column for MyNorthwest.comthat the plans accidentally shared present a ""direct contradiction"" to promises from Democrats during the election cycle and lay out 10 total new taxes on residents.
""These proposals come at a time when the state has seen years of record revenue,"" Rantz said, going on to claim some of the ""tax schemes"" may also be unconstitutional.
He added that capital gains taxes actually discourage growth and potentially lead to reduced job opportunities for the same workers pro-tax Democrats claim to want to help.
One example he presented was the departure of Amazon founder Jeffrey Bezos fromWashington state. Upon establishing his new Florida residency, one of America’s richest men saved about $1 billion in taxes that also no longer go toward funding the Evergreen State’s programs.
Rantz added that the Washington state Democratic electorate often decries the affordability crisis but then goes on to re-elect the same politicians that exacerbate it.

As he prepares to take office, President-elect Donald Trump has outlined an audacious goal of returning to pre-pandemic rates of economic growth and a ""golden age of America."" After four years of being told the economy was better than how it hit our wallets, this is a welcome change of direction.
To achieve this objective, the new administration is going to need the private sector – something the Biden era not only mostly ignored, but whose regulatory agenda was downright hostile to the concerns of most industries. The franchise sector, which I represent and includes 800,000 small businesses supporting 9 million workers, is ready to get to work as a resource to the Trump administration.
Franchising played a starring role in the 2024 election, no more so than Trump’s turn behind the fryer of a Pennsylvania McDonald’s. While franchising is often associated with food, most (more than six in ten) are in another industry, ranging from hotels, salons, fitness, pet care and many more.
EXPERT SOUNDS ALARM ON A ‘DEFINITE SHIFT’ HAPPENING IN CORPORATE AMERICA
Even after several punitive attacks on franchising from the Biden administration, the franchise sector is projected to have grown by 4% this year compared to 2.7% for the broader economy.

Even that brief stint in fast food is a strong reminder of the importance of franchisesto the US economy.(Win McNamee/Getty Images)
With a change in philosophy at the federal government, the opportunities for franchising’s animal spirits to be harnessed are ripe. Here are three things the Trump administration can do to supercharge its economic growth:
There is no bigger federal priority for franchising thanclarifying the joint employer standard.The entire model hinges on the independence between the franchisor (the brand) and its individual franchisees. The former provides the concept, the framework and the branding for the latter, who is free to run their own business, in exchange for an agreed-upon fee and following the brand standards that consumers expect, whether in Palm Beach or Parsippany.
In 2023, the Biden administration’s National Labor Relations Board tried to reverse the 2020Trump joint employer standardand remove the autonomy between franchisors and franchisees. As the name suggests, the goal was putting the franchisor on the hook for franchisee’s employees to increase legal liability and ease of unionization.
Thankfully, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas threw out the Biden overreach, but after four changes to this rule in the last decade, franchising needs a permanent standard for joint employment that codifies the Trump definition. Business owners can’t plan when the regulatory climate is always changing with the occupant of the White House. They need certainty.
In 2017, Congress passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), known colloquially asthe Trump tax cuts.Contrary to opponents’ suggestions about ""tax cuts for the rich,"" these policies became lifelines for small business owners, helping take the economy to new highs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet without action, they are all set to expire at the end of 2025.
One especially important component of the Trump tax cuts is Section 199A, which allows for a 20% deduction of qualified income for pass-through businesses. Since most franchise businesses are structured as a pass-through entity, 199A levels the playing field between small businesses and large corporations, who already enjoy a bevy of tax cuts.
To head off any last-minute ""fiscal cliffs"" like the recent showdown over government funding, the re-authorization of the tax cuts should be prioritized early in the new year. Not only would the action allow small business owners much-needed certainty, but it would also send a clear message that the days of putting off important action until the last moment are over.
Prior to Biden appointing Lina Khan to lead the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2021, most Americans had never heard of the agency, and for good reason.

Instead of standing up for consumers, Khan antagonized the business community. She launchedcountless lawsuitsand investigations, forcing industry to spend precious time and resources fending off government regulators rather than growing their businesses.

In 2023, Khan launched a sweeping Request For Information into franchising designed to elicit negative comments, and then extended its time period in the summer of 2024, when she didn’t get the desired results.
Trump named Andrew Ferguson as his replacement for Khan, and not a moment too soon. Already, there are promising signs that the tide is turning. The highly anticipated ""junk fee"" rule announced by the FTC was more narrowly tailored than its original iteration.

America didn’t become the envy of the world by settling for less. We didn’t heed President John F. Kennedy’s call of walking on the moon in the 1960s or President Ronald Reagan’s mission to ""tear down this wall"" in the 1980s by going small.
Reaching that 4% economic growth number will require everyone rowing in the same direction. The franchise community stands ready and willing to do our part.

https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-hes-not-changed-his-mind-h-1b-visas-debate-rages-within-maga-coalition,Trump says he's not changed his mind on H-1B visas as debate rages within MAGA coalition,"Columnist David Marcus joins Fox & Friends to discuss the disagreement over H-1B visas after Elon Musk and President-elect Trump expressed support.
President-elect Donald Trumpclaimed this week that he has not changed his mind about the controversial H-1B visa program and that the U.S. needs ""smart people"" coming into the country, amid a furious intra-Republican debate on the visa program.
""I didn't change my mind. I've always felt we have to have the most competent people in our country, and we need competent people,"" Trump said at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday evening. ""We need smart people coming into our country. We need a lot of people coming in. We're going to have jobs like we've never had before.""
The H-1B visa program allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers for specialty occupations and is overwhelmingly usedby the tech industry. However, it has long been controversial for some conservatives, who say it is abused by tech companies to bring in cheap, predominantly Indian, labor to replace American workers.
ERIC SCHMITT BLASTS ‘ABUSE’ OF H-1B VISA PROGRAM, SAYS AMERICANS ‘SHOULDN’T TRAIN THEIR FOREIGN REPLACEMENTS'

The program hit the headlines last week whenElon Muskand Vivek Ramaswamy, who have been tapped by Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, argued for the importance of foreign workers for tech companies.
""The reason I’m in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla, and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,"" Musk said on X.
That re-opened a rift between those on the right over the program and whether it is being used to attract the best talent or being used by companies to bring in cheaper labor, who are tied to their job by the visa.
Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., said on Fox News Sunday that H1-B visas are being ""abused.""
""I think the abuses of the H-1B program have been evident, where you have sort of the sons and daughters of those factory workers who lost their jobs, gotwhite collar jobsas accountants, and they're, you know, training their replacements, the foreign workers who are undercutting their wages,"" he said.

TRUMP ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO CHANGE H-1B GUEST WORKER PROGRAM TO PRIORITIZE HIGHER-WAGE APPLICANTS
Trump has previously shown skepticism about theH-1B visa program. During his 2016 presidential campaign, he promised to tackle the abuse of the program and pointed to allegations of companies forcing Americans to train their cheaper replacements.
""The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those thatoccurred at Disneyin Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements,"" he said in 2016.
""I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. No exceptions,"" he said.
He also said that his companies use the H-1B program ""and I shouldn’t be allowed to use it.""

His administration immediately began looking into reforms to the H-1B visa program, and, in 2020, it proposed asweeping rulethat would prioritize the selection of higher wage applicants for the approximately 85,000 visas allocated annually.
That rule would have required that registrations at the highest of four wage levels get to apply for the visa allocation first. Once those at the highest level have applied, then the process would turn to level III, and so on until the spaces are filled.
""Put simply, because demand for H-1B visas has exceeded the annual supply for more than a decade, DHS prefers that cap-subject H-1B visas go to beneficiaries earning the highest wages relative to their [Standard Occupational Classification] codes and area(s) of intended employment,"" the rule says.
TRUMP SAYS HE IS A ‘BELIEVER’ IN H-1B VISAS FOR SKILLED WORKERS AS RIGHT SPARS ON IMMIGRATION: REPORT
The rule was notput into effect due to the Biden administration, which abandoned it and has since proposed a rule of its own. However, it was greeted favorably by immigration hawks. Other rules put forward during the Trump administration proposed narrowing the definition of ""specialty occupation"" and making changes to the way the ""prevailing wage"" is set in order to make sure U.S. wages are not undercut.
The incoming Trump administration has not said specifically what it will do in terms of H-1B and whether it will resurrect its first-term efforts. However, Musk proposed ""raising the minimum salary significantly and adding a yearly cost for maintaining the H1B, making it materially more expensive to hire from overseas than domestically. ""
""I’ve been very clear that the program is broken and needs major reform,"" he said on Saturday.
At the same time, Trump told theNew York Postthat the program is ""great.""

""I’ve always liked the visas, I have always been in favor of the visas. That’s why we have them,"" Trump said.
""I have many H-1B visas on my properties. I’ve been a believer in H-1B. I have used it many times. It’s a great program.""

https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/democrats-paid-price-abandoning-moderate-clinton-era-policies,Democrats paid the price for abandoning moderate Clinton-era policies,"Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram joins ‘Special Report’ with the latest on the fight to become top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee.
Let’s face it, theDemocratic Party got off track.
Back in the late ’90s,President Bill Clintonhad approval ratings in the 70s as the party stood for a form of centrist progressivism. It meant finding a vital center in which the party looked to give people in need a helping hand but required people take responsibility for their own actions. That meant the adoption of policies like Pell Grants that required a B average or work requirements for welfare or a balanced budget. The economy soared.
But the left fought these policies, and gradually they regained more and more power, beginning especially with the second term of President Barack Obama and ultimately becoming the guiding hand of the Biden administration. The Sanders-Biden pack, combined with a raft of Obama staff in key positions, sent the party into uncharted waters.

Democrats passed huge spending bills using COVID-19 as cover to dump trillions of dollars into climate change policies designed to wipe out fossil fuel use, even as alternatives are not really ready.
The Justice Department under Merrick Garland became an enforcer of left-wing policies, arresting political opponents, handcuffing the police, even going after parents complaining to school boards as though they were terrorists.
While government spending and deficits ballooned, companies werefalsely blamed for inflationthat served as the ultimate regressive tax on all Americans.
The cultural wars left Americans dumbfounded as criminals were elevated to victims, gender ideology and enforced pronouns ruled policy, religion was shown the back seat and identity became more important that individual character in rewarding success.
Young people were fed a steady diet of all this through TikTok and academics justified it even as it defied common sense.

Even foreign policy was turned on its head as friendly allies were summarily abandoned in the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal that was a turning point in the Biden presidency. Iran received billions that they used to extend terrorism, and Israel was continually restrained and chastised while no red lines were drawn for hostages to be released or face the consequences. And hundreds of billions were spent on the Ukraine war without any serious diplomatic activity or even capability.
And free speech was equated with violence; tech companies were used to implement speech codes that deflected criticism of the administration’s policies. This degrading of the First Amendment, America’s core value, is yet another example of how the party has strayed from its most basic foundational American values.
Democrats passed huge spending bills using COVID-19 as cover to dump trillions of dollars into climate change policies designed to wipe out fossil fuel use, even as alternatives are not really ready.
All the while, the president pretended the Hunter Biden laptop was fake while in reality it exposed a scheme to bilk $20 million dollars out of various foreign interests with the now obvious help of President Joe Biden, whose denials were as phony as the idea he was ready to run for a second term.

The coin is dated 1987 with an engraved inscription.
""Assuming the person bought the coin in 1987, they would have paid an average price that year of $520. That's over 500% difference from the 1987 value,"" said Zanca, adding that the donation is ""great"" for the Salvation Army.
